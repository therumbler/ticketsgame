Bassy\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Walking 450 miles down the California coast to clear your thoughts and film a music video might sound a bit insane, but that\u2019s the length singer-songwriter Marc E. Bassy goes to for his art. A true creative, Marc cites making music as necessary to his health and well-being as food, shelter, or sex. Marc's knack for penning honest, catchy, and heartfelt tunes has served him well for the past several years. The San Francisco-born and Los Angeles-based artist has made quite a name for himself, composing hits for the likes of Wiz Khalifa, 2 Chainz, Chris Brown, Allen Stone, and pop princess PIA MIA, founding the chart-topping pop group 2AM Club, and releasing an independent EP, Only the Poets, which was acclaimed by Billboard, Complex, and SPIN in 2014. However, it was in early 2015 when Marc truly honed his sound while working on music as a form of therapy while crashing at a friend\u2019s pad in downtrodden East Hollywood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving recently broken up with a long-term girlfriend and with his band of 10 years, Marc found the strength and inspiration to cope by going through a period of self-medicating and non-stop partying, followed by binge-reading his favorite authors Charles Bukowski and Henry Miller (with whom he felt a special connection, because they too, had experienced the lowest of lows while staying in East Hollywood). Feeding this need to create, Marc got down to songwriting again, but this time with a renewed vigor to zero in on his personal sound. \u201cI had been writing songs for other people for so long that I got a lot of practice,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce I started focusing on my own music again, I finally realized how to combine that element of making something stick with my own voice. This style of music was what I\u2019d always been chasing.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe product of his creative revelation, East Hollywood, crystallized Marc\u2019s approach. Co-produced with Count Bassy, the five-song set cumulatively amassed 1 million Soundcloud plays-and-counting over the course of the summer and caught the attention of The Roots drummer, Questlove, who personally requested that Marc perform at his annual Roots Picnic outdoor festival. Friend and recent collaborator Kehlani followed suit when she asked Marc to open for her West Coast tour. Republic Records took notice, quickly inking a deal with Marc to give East Hollywood a proper commercial release on December 18th, 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeatured on the EP, Marc teamed up with Ty Dolla $ign to write and produce \u201cThat\u2019s Love\u201d \u2013 a melancholy song written about vulnerability, trust, and unconditional love that combines boozy, bass-heavy production with brutal honesty and sexy storytelling. Originally written as a song for Ty to use, Marc ultimately kept it for himself at Ty\u2019s urging. True to Marc\u2019s form, the song possesses two elements of his signature style \u2013 the subject matter embraces the good, along with the bad and ugly, while the lyrics are autobiographical yet relatable. Marc explains, \\\"That song is about young love. There\u2019s no better feeling when you and your significant other are going crazy, yelling, and fighting just because you fucking love each other so much.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh off the \u2018When It\u2019s Dark Out\u2019 tour with G-Eazy and A$AP Ferg, Marc is only picking up steam. Writing his best, most authentic music to date while hitting his stride on stage, Marc approaches the journey ahead with true artistic perspective. He\u2019s letting the feelings evoked from his realest, most personal experiences drive his music \u2013 He holds nothing back. Once, Marc even admitted that he loves having his heart broken. Why? \u201cIt makes you pick yourself off the floor and do better,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to be myself on a record and use the voice I\u2019ve got. I want to share something honest with them and hope they become inspired to be themselves. I want people to feel.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/55/83-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/marc_e_bassy\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/MarcEBassyMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/MARCEBASSY\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"MARCEBASSY\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1761067,\"name\":\"Bobby Brackins\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Amidst a wave of self-made songwriters, artists and producers, Oakland, California\u2019s Bobby Brackins is at the crest. With over 25 million YouTube plays, and international radio spins, the established soloist who has written a litany of artists including Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj, Zendaya, Trey Songz, Dev, Jeremih, and Tinashe, is finally coming into his own as a soloist with a sharp pen and easygoing charm. \\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing up in the diverse streets of East Oakland, Bobby immersed himself in a variety of cultures, styles, and attitudes. Bringing that vast influence to his arts, Brackins graduated a local Pop star, hearing himself on radio the night of his senior prom. . \u201cWe were all getting back in the limo, and the song played, with our dates all that. It was pretty dope,\u201d recalls the artist, who hasn\u2019t slowed down eight years later. Following his Go Dav cut, \u201cRide Or Die Chick,\u201d it only grew. \u201cAfter that, everybody in the Bay area pretty much knew me, and that I made music. I\u2019ve been pretty popular ever since.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing high school, Brackins relocated to Los Angeles alongside his producer and close friend, Nic Nac. \u201cI wanted to keep making music with Nic, and I knew that L.A. was more industry-based. That\u2019s where the labels and well-connected managers were.\u201d There, he embedded himself in a hungry musical community that included friends and collaborators such as YG, Ty Dolla $ign, ScHoolboy Q, and DJ Mustard in addition to hit-making vets, Chris Brown and Ray J. Although he was in the land of the stars, the artist with the government name used the Internet to build a base. With a strong female following, Brackins says, \u201cI took advantage of the web, learning how to market and brand myself, and grow more popular.\u201d With impressive numbers on his singles and videos, the \u201c143\u201d-maker continued to work, and fuse sonic styles. \u201cBesides legends like E-40 and Too Short, there weren\u2019t many artists from my generation who were from the Bay, working with L.A. talent. So I put it on myself, I built the bridge, for this generation.\u201d Co-headlining his first tour with YG, and closely working with Los Angeles\u2019 new musical guard, Bobby Brackins has touched many facets of the Southern Cali sound, despite his Bay area roots.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven with his viral success, Brackins is patient with his brand and timing. \u201cWe live in a singles-driven market; it\u2019s not 1990 anymore,\u201d he jokes, regarding his yet-released debut. \u201cSingles can go platinum and gold, and albums can come out and sell 10,000 copies. I\u2019ve seen it many times. If it gets to the point where you feel like an album necessary and needed, it\u2019ll be done.\u201d Looking at YG\u2019s success as well as fellow writers-turned-artists like The-Dream and Ty$, the twenty-something has no issue waiting for on a proper offering, despite eight mixtapes in as many years, including 2013\u2019s Maxwell Park. Until the fan-base is there, where I can do shows across the country, filling up 5,000-plus-seat venues, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll drop an album,\u201d he admits.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil then, Bobby has plenty of work. The writer and producer revealed that Rihanna\u2019s camp recently solicited some of his hit-making abilities. \u201cI don\u2019t ever shop records. One of my friends might play it for somebody, or more often, the artists are coming to the studio to witness the whole creative process, from scratch.\u201d Locked in the lab, it\u2019s dutifully plugging away that\u2019s led to Bobby penning and co-producing a #1 record for Chris Brown in \u201cLoyal,\u201d as well as helping Tinashe find the traction necessary to earn a major label album release date with her lead single, \u201c2 On.\u201d \u201cPeople are seeing my name more and more, and they\u2019re giving me a lil\u2019 more credit. I\u2019m excited about dropping my own music, and giving people awareness that I\u2019ve helped mold the new West Coast sound.\u201d The credit is there, is as the chart and viral reaction, assuring the world that Bobby Brackins has his pen, production, and artistry on the pulse of the people.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/23/63-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bobbybrackins.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/bbrackins\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/BobbyBrackins\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"BobbyBrackins\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.attheecho.com/event/1322121?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
