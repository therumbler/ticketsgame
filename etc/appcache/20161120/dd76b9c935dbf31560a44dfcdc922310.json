\\\"Alibis,\\\" and \\\"Find Out Who Your Friends Are.\\\" The entertainer has enjoyed twenty-two songs on the Billboard top ten charts with eighteen number one singles, selling over thirteen million albums.\\n\\nThe Multi-platinum CMA and ACM award winning recording artist has helped shape the sound of Country music for two decades, recently celebrating twenty-years in music. Few country artists have ever known the kind of success that Tracy Lawrence has earned and the influence his iconic voice has contributed to the Country music genre.\\n\\nHis music has inspired a whole new generation of entertainers and fans. Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan frequently pay tribute to the singer live in concert by playing his double-platinum hits like \\\"Time Marches On\\\" and \\\"Alibis.\\\" Songs that help make Lawrence among one of the most played artists on radio.\\n\\nLawrence has set out to embark on the next chapter of his music career with his highly anticipated forthcoming studio album Headlights, Taillights And Radios to be released August 2013. The first single, \\\"Stop Drop And Roll\\\" written by hit songwriters Casey Beathard who penned Lawrence's CMA and ACM award winning hit \\\"Find Out Who Your Friends Are\\\" and Brandon Kinney, marks the singers first studio album in five years.\\n\\nHeadlights, Taillights And Radios is not just another release for Lawrence, it's a testament to how his music continues to evolve and engage all generations of Country music fans. The 11-song collection features some of his most progressive music to date.\\n\\nReflecting on the creative process when recording Headlights, Taillights And Radios Lawrence knew that he needed to push the envelope and creativity to a new level. \\\"When recording the new album it was a very different process than I had ever done before,\\\" said Lawrence. \\\"We ended up recording the album in two parts, that's just how it worked out. I started recording in the direction to make a more traditional County record. But as time progressed, I needed to explore and challenge myself musically. I wanted to go deeper and try a more edgy and progressive sound that reflected where I was going next. The combination really worked well for me and I think it will appeal to many different types of County music fans.\\\"\\n\\nThe album title Headlights, Taillights And Radios carries a signature meaning for the artist. \\\"Headlights\\\" looking to the future; \\\"Taillights\\\" celebrating the past; and \\\"Radios\\\" a tribute to his success on radio.\\n\\nHeadlights, Taillights And Radios gives us a new Tracy Lawrence. One that is sure to inspire and ignite a whole new generation of Country music.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":502,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":382},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":255},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-og.jpg\",\"width\":502,\"height\":640},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":127},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":637},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":502,\"height\":640},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/30/17-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.tracylawrence.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/johnmichaelmontgomery\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/therealtracylawrence\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/tracy_lawrence\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"tracy_lawrence\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1767099,\"name\":\"Tracy Byrd\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Tracy Byrd became a household name on the Country Music Scene in 1993 when his third single, called \\\"Holdin' Heaven\\\" off of his MCA Records, self-titled debut album, hit #1 on the Billboard Country Charts. The Album also included the remake hit of Johnny Paycheck's \\\"Someone to Give my Love to\\\" cementing Byrd as a Traditional Country Troubadour!! The Debut Album went on to be certified Gold, a reward signifying sales in excess of 500,000 copies.\\n\\nByrd's second project, \\\"No Ordinary Man\\\", kept building on the momentum the first album created, the first radio single from it called \\\"Lifestyle's of the Not so Rich and Famous\\\" reached #4, followed by another top five hit, \\\"The First Step\\\", then with the release of the smash, chart topping hit \\\"Watermelon Crawl\\\" the second album crossed the half million sales mark and certified Gold. The release of the 4th and last single on this project moved Byrd to the top of both the Billboard Album and Singles charts. The song was called \\\"The Keeper of the Star's\\\" and it shot to #1 on the singles charts and pushed the album to Double Platinum Status, which certifies sales of over 2 Million Copies. \\\"The Keeper of the Star's\\\" won Academy of Country Music's \\\"Song of the Year\\\" award in 1995. A Keeper Year for Tracy Byrd for sure.\\n\\nHis third studio Album, \\\"Love Lesson\\\" is one of Tracy's favorites. It included the title track, another top five hit single for Byrd, also included were the top 15 singles, \\\"Walking to Jerusalem\\\" and \\\"Heaven in My Woman's Eyes\\\", Byrd's personal favorite. A 4th top 15 single was released called \\\"4 to 1 in Atlanta\\\" which Byrd performed live on the David Letterman Show.  The \\\"Love Lesson's\\\" album also reached sales of 500,000 copies certifying Gold. \\\"Big Love\\\" became Byrd's fourth studio album with its release in the fall of 1996.  It spawned two more top five singles with the release of the title track and \\\"Don't Take Her She's All I've Got\\\" The Videos of both of these songs reached the top of CMT's Video Chart's and also earned Byrd his first TNN Television Special titled \\\"Tracy Byrd's Big Love\\\" on which Byrd invited guest's Johnny Paycheck, Mark Chesnutt, and Asleep at the Wheel. The Album \\\"Big Love\\\" became Tracy's fourth consecutive Studio Album to be Certified Gold, an almost unheard of feat. Tracy said that this meant more to him than anything because he knew Fan's weren't just listening to his hit songs on the radio, they were laying down their hard earned money to own a copy of their own and that was flattering. \\n\\nThe fifth project on MCA was titled, \\\"I'm From the Country\\\" and it contained the title track a fun, party song stating what most fan's already knew, that Tracy Byrd was from the Country and sang Country Music. The CD also contained a Beautiful Ballad called \\\"I Wanna Feel That Way Again\\\" Both of these single's reached the Top Five on the Charts.  It was at this same time that TNN Outdoors recruited Byrd as the TV Host of their Weekend Outdoor Broadcast.  Tracy, a well-known outdoorsman, was perfect for the job and continued his hosting responsibilities for three years. At this point in his career, Tracy Byrd, was looking for a change in labels, but still was under contract with MCA Records who were preparing a release of \\\"Keepers: Greatest Hits\\\" containing all the hit's from Byrd's catalog of songs.  The album quickly earned another Gold Record award for Byrd but he was trying to persuade MCA to let him out of his contract so he could pursue a different direction.  MCA finally allowed Byrd out of his contract and he quickly signed with RCA Records and got to work on a new project, \\\"It's About Time\\\", that would be released in November of 1999 and would reach the top 10 quickly with the single \\\"Put Your Hand In Mine\\\" Byrd has said that this album is the most Traditional Album he ever released and therefore his favorite.\\n\\nTracy Byrd crossed into the new Millennium with the release of his Album \\\"10 Rounds\\\". It took off on the release of a duet with his longtime hometown buddy and hero Mark Chesnutt.  The song was called \\\"A Good Way to get on my Bad Side\\\" and was a milestone for Byrd to finally get to record with his good friend. Then came the release of the party song of the year, \\\"10 Rounds with Jose Cuervo\\\" which shot to the top of the Billboard Charts to notch Byrd's third #1 single. He also hit the top 10 with his Spanish guitar flared \\\"Just Let Me be in Love\\\". Next came \\\"The Truth About Men\\\", which first released the title track which was a comedic look at what Men are really like, it was a team effort with Tracy's buddies Blake Shelton, Andy Griggs, and Troy and Eddie of Montgomery Gentry lending their talents to the song and the video. This Album also released the top five smash \\\"The Drinkin' Bone\\\" which became a crowd favorite sing along song. Byrd was then moved to BNA Records, the sister label of RCA, and they released his second greatest hits project, another feat that not many artists experience, two Greatest hits projects!!! It debuted in the top five of the album charts and became Byrd's sixth Gold Album, and sent him to over 6 Million Records Sold!!!\\n\\nByrd then left the major label and released an album on his own, appropriately titled, \\\"Different Things\\\". Although this project was not commercially successful, it garnered Byrd his highest Critical acclaim of his career with Billboard magazine choosing it as one of their Top 10 Country Albums of the Year!!!  \\n\\nThrough all of these years Byrd became a promoter favorite on the road, performing over 4000 exciting shows across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, and Australia from 1992 until 2009!  He then say's he needed a break to take care of himself and his most precious thing, his family, wife Michelle, daughter Evee, and son's Logan and Jared, who had taken a backseat to his career for years. He did not perform from 2010-2013, but in 2014 he got back to the music with a new band and a new found sobriety and love of the thing he enjoys so much.  Say's Byrd, \\\"These day's my life has great balance, with my music being a part of it, not all of it.  I can honestly say I have never enjoyed it more\\\".\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/TracyByrdMusic/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://stampedehouston.ticketfly.com/event/1379158?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
