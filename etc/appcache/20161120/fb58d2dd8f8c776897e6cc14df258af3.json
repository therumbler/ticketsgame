This is music of the past, present, and future \u2014 a\\r\\nboundlessness earned and not bestowed. One Lost Day has a feeling of music composed across\\r\\ntime, not just in time. These songs are rooted in tradition and inventive, too: nourished in dark\\r\\nsoils, leafing and luminous.\\r\\nMemories here are more than specters; they are evolutions. The album maps the dim corridors of\\r\\nthe heart and mind, lifting and landing the listener across state lines and continents. Place is a\\r\\ncharacter rich in the universal specific: \\\"Boots on a board in a barn\\\" in \\\"Texas Was Clean,\\\" boys\\r\\n\\\"under the bridge on the river shoals off GA 9\\\" in \\\"Fishtails,\\\" the New Orleans' 1788 fire and the\\r\\nfence around the St. Louis cemetery in \\\"Elizabeth,\\\" the \\\"sunny twist of Venice Chez Jay\\\" in\\r\\n\\\"Southern California is Your Girlfriend,\\\" and the devil-spawned Angola prison in Louisiana\\r\\nwhere three black men sat wrongly convicted for decades, confined in solitary.\\r\\nThe dirge-like ballad \\\"Findlay, Ohio 1968\\\" opens with a searing string and piano arrangement\\r\\nthat feels like slipping through a tear in the space-time continuum. After we reach the violin's\\r\\nheld high-C and the heartbeat drums, and before Saliers kicks in with her chilling vocals, we\\r\\nhover, suspended in time, before landing gently on the hot asphalt of Grammy's driveway in\\r\\n1968, \\\"poking hot tar bubbles with a stick\u2026the smell of the trash and leaves burning in the can.\\\"\\r\\nWhat unfolds is pure narrative intuition, wherein the stuff of life, life's inventory \u2014 the pall of\\r\\nthe impending Kent State massacre, Sexton's poetry, Cathy's grief-stricken, beer-drinking mom,\\r\\nthe dad who never returned from Vietnam, the fence-scaling girl ripping jeans, the boy with\\r\\nwandering heart and hands, the smell of Trenton's refineries and the slapping of the station\\r\\nwagon's wheels \u2014 are the metaphoric legs that carry the story and this song across time and\\r\\ndistance.\\r\\n\\\"Fishtails\\\" tackles similar themes \u2014 loss of innocence, coming of age \u2014 but through a much\\r\\ndifferent lens. Here, the narrator is the observer reflecting on the tender recklessness of\\r\\nneighborhood kids, killing time in an abandoned copper mine, waiting to flee the confines of\\r\\ntheir small world, raging and hoping and \\\"fishtailing in the dark from the time that they are\\r\\nborn.\\\" But the song is infused with new meaning in the juxtaposition of the boys' lives with Ray's\\r\\nfather's long-ago Florida boyhood \u2014 so similar in its restlessness, its sweet violence. Circularity\\r\\nrings like a keening bell, dazzling and devastating. A multi-layered instrumentalism allows the\\r\\nlong notes of the past to cradle the mid-tempo of the present, a lush but understated\\r\\norchestration.\\r\\nRegarding the aching ballad, \\\"If I Don't Leave Here Now,\\\" Saliers says, \\\"The song explores the\\r\\nterrible affliction of addiction and was partly inspired right after Philip Seymour Hoffman died. I\\r\\nwas deeply affected by his death, but also know that addiction seldom spares the user. It is a song\\r\\nabout the desperate attempt to leave a bad situation where no amount of anything is ever\\r\\nenough.\\\" The elegiac, stripped-down sound pairs beautifully with tender lyrics that recognize\\r\\naddiction not as a denial of life, but as a dangerous insatiability for life (\\\"Killing yourself to keep\\r\\nfrom running out of life\\\") \u2014 turning the conventional addiction narrative on its head.\\r\\n\\\"I\u2019d rather have the strength to see through the lens of reality than rose-colored glasses,\\\" Ray\\r\\nsays in reference to the raucous, rollicking \\\"Happy in the Sorrow Key.\\\" \\\"Musically, I was\\r\\ninspired by the feel of Paul Weller and The Jam, but then I also wanted this big orchestral bridge\\r\\nto mirror the feeling of lying in my bunk at night on the tour bus and drifting off to sleep \u2014\\r\\nscared but in awe of the process of life.\\\" The dissonance between the plaintive lyrics and the\\r\\nquick-tempoed, lush instrumentalism nails the ambiguity of the emotion, while also managing to\\r\\ncreate a rock song that is both fun and dirty.\\r\\nA majority of the songs in this collection explore a time and place endemic to the narrator's sense\\r\\nof self. \\\"Texas Was Clean\\\" is a plucky, whispery elegy to lands loved and left behind. \\\"It became\\r\\nabout how a place gets reinvented and defined by your experiences over time,\\\" says Ray. \\\"When\\r\\nI was young, Texas seemed so far away and remote, but now it feels like it is part of me \u2014 for\\r\\nthe lives it's claimed and for the life it\u2019s given to me.\\\" \\\"Elizabeth,\\\" the album's joyful opener,\\r\\ntakes place in New Orleans, \\\"with its ghosts and underbelly,\\\" explains Saliers. \\\"It\u2019s the story of\\r\\nkinship and music and whiskey, L\u2019il Queenie and the Big Easy whose bloody print is indelible.\\r\\nIt\u2019s denying Facebook and simply allowing someone from your past to remain in all her splendid\\r\\nglory.\\\" In fact, much of this album seems to argue against our culture's obsession with immediate\\r\\ngratification, both a musical and lyrical affinity for the journey and not the journey's memento.\\r\\nVenturing further north, \\\"Alberta\\\" is about the indelible impressions of a place and its history,\\r\\nthose that we keep close and those that we leave behind. \\\"Olympia Inn\\\" pays homage to a bus\\r\\ndriver named Johnny who called everyone \\\"darling\\\" and shared his lost loves, triumphs, and\\r\\nfailures late at night as the band toured the UK and Ireland. It's a wild, rocking ride of a song.\\r\\n\\\"It\u2019s meant to be romp with some swagger and self-deprecation thrown in for good measure,\\\"\\r\\nsays Ray. \\\"Emily experimented with different guitar sounds and vocal approaches to bring her\\r\\nparts to life, and then Jordan [producer and contributing musician] put the organ down at the end\\r\\nand used The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion as an inspiration.\\\"\\r\\nLike a good book, One Lost Day builds to the climactic \\\"The Rise of The Black Messiah\\\" about\\r\\ntwo-thirds of the way through the album, imbuing the whole with a structural integrity inherent\\r\\nto the best storytelling. This hard-hitting rock song is chilling, a battle-cry for victims of\\r\\ninstitutional racism. \\\"My friend I heard you tell of slavery\u2019s end but have you heard of mass\\r\\nincarceration/That ol\u2019 Jim Crow he just keeps getting born with a new hanging rope for the black\\r\\nman\u2019s scourge,\\\" bellows Ray. The song was inspired by a letter Ray received about seven years\\r\\nago from Herman Wallace, one of the so-called \\\"Angola 3\\\": a trio of young black men framed\\r\\nfor the murder of a prison guard as punishment for speaking out about the horrifying conditions\\r\\nin the Angola prison in Louisiana. Wallace spent decades in solitary confinement before finally\\r\\nreceiving \\\"compassionate release\\\" just days before his death from cancer. In his letter, he asked\\r\\nRay to share his story, and \\\"The Rise of The Black Messiah\\\" is Ray's anthemic response; a slowbuilding,\\r\\nthunderous rock song anchored by Brady Blade's spirited, soulful drums.\\r\\nOn One Lost Day, the Girl's signature harmonies are in full display: rolling, recursive, hot and\\r\\ncapacious as prayer. Through dynamic soundscapes created in tandem with producer Jordan\\r\\nBrooke Hamlin, the album reveals structural innovations that enhance meaning. A classicallytrained\\r\\nhorn player, Hamlin contributed \\\"layered ethereal horn parts and a strong vision and ear,\\\"\\r\\nsays Saliers. With Hamlin, the Girls took new risks that paid huge dividends. The collaborative\\r\\nspirit is loud here, utilizing a host of musicians both familiar and new to the duo. One Lost Day\\r\\nwas recorded in studios in Nashville, TN and mixed by Brian Joseph at Justin Vernon\u2019s (of Bon\\r\\nIver) April Base Studios in Fall Creek, WI and at the Parhelion Recording Studios in Atlanta,\\r\\nGA. Amy and Emily brought in Lex Price (k.d. lang, Mindy Smith), Butterfly Boucher (Ingrid\\r\\nMichaelson, Katie Herzig, Mat Kearney), Fred Eltringham (Sheryl Crow, The Wallflowers,\\r\\nGigolo Aunts) and Chris Donohue (Dave Matthews, Patty Griffin, Lucinda Williams, Robert\\r\\nPlant) to bring a good dose of infectious energy and creativity to the scene. Additionally,\\r\\nmusicians Brady Blade and Carol Isaacs \u2014 longstanding studio collaborators and live-show\\r\\nband members with the Girls \u2014 returned, along with the current Indigo Girls\u2019 touring band.\\r\\nIsaacs contributes haunting piano parts on songs such as \\\"Come a Long Way,\\\" \\\"If I Don't Leave\\r\\nHere Now,\\\" and \\\"Fishtails,\\\" and sonorous accordion parts to \\\"Spread the Pain Around\\\" and\\r\\n\\\"Findlay, Ohio 1968.\\\" Blade offers his free-wheelin', Louisiana drumming style to \\\"Fishtails,\\\"\\r\\n\\\"Elizabeth,\\\" \\\"Texas Was Clean,\\\" and the \\\"The Rise of The Black Messiah.\\\" The inputs of many\\r\\nof the contributing musicians are captured in a series of videos by the talented Kathlyn Horan,\\r\\nwho filmed the crew during the recording of the album. The videos are available on the Indigo\\r\\nGirls' website and in them we glimpse the ferocity and attention to detail that has helped the\\r\\nIndigo Girls thrive through the various capitulations of a changing music industry. Starting with\\r\\n2009's Poseidon and the Bitter Bug, their eleventh studio album, the Girls formed their own\\r\\nlabel, IG Recordings, which is now distributed by Vanguard/Concord Music Group. The move\\r\\naligns with their long held commitment to creative freedom, energy they've also devoted to\\r\\nvarious social and environmental causes.\\r\\nThe Indigo Girls have spent thirty-five years performing together, produced fifteen albums\\r\\n(seven gold, four platinum, and one double platinum), earned a Grammy and seven Grammy\\r\\nnominations, and have toured arenas, festivals, and clubs the world over. It is rare to find\\r\\nmusicians together so long, rarer still with such profound successes. Their music lives in the\\r\\nhearts of generations of dedicated fans and continues to inspire young musicians. This loyalty is\\r\\nnot accidental. Perhaps their relevance over three decades can be credited to the mighty\\r\\ncollisions of distinct aesthetics forging new paths over time. The Girls' refinement \u2014 not only of\\r\\nstyle and skill, but of their own creative processes \u2014 allows access to ever new and liminal\\r\\nspaces.\\r\\nA long creative marriage fosters its own scrappy beauty, though, and theirs grows more nuanced,\\r\\nweatherworn, and lovely in each successive album. Saliers and Ray live separate lives, take on\\r\\nindependent projects, but share \\\"the same set of values,\\\" says Saliers. \\\"We both embrace the\\r\\nstruggle, share the same energy. We are sisters in our embrace of life. Observers.\\\" That sort of\\r\\nartistic kinship is rare and cosmic. Here, then, are the stars of that labor, the next chapter.\\r\\n- Jessica Hendry Nelson\\r\\nMay 19, 2015\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/79/44/03-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.indigogirls.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/indigogirlsmusic\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/TheIndigoGirls\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Indigo_Girls\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Indigo_Girls\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.terminalwestatl.com/event/1329449?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
