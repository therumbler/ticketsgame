The work of such artists as Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, and Kurt Cobain \u2013 and now Jason Isbell, I would argue, with his new album Something More Than Free \u2013 spreads irresistibly outward from the soul, that private well of vision and emotion, into the broader realm of cultural history, sharpening our ability to see, expanding our ability to feel, and restoring our sense that we belong not only to ourselves but to an extended spiritual family. The songs create a space to be together, and closer together than we were before.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo fans and the music press, the personal story surrounding Isbell's last, breakthrough album, Southeastern, is widely known and easily reprised. A troubled young troubadour, newly married, stepped away from the darkness of addiction into a new, uncertain life of clarity and commitment, reflecting ruefully on his hard won victories and the price he paid attaining them. It was an album of aching elegance, marked by the sort of lyrical precision that brought to mind certain literary masters of the melancholy American scene, from Flannery O'Connor to Raymond Carver. By avoiding the hairy-chested bombast of arena country music while crafting music with solid melodic contours Isbell created an album, and a sound, of memorably infectious empathy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Something More Than Free, he stretches himself further, greatly expanding the boundaries of Isbell country, that territory of the heart and mind where people strive against their imperfections, and simultaneously against their circumstances, in a landscape that's often unfriendly to their hopes. As always, he starts with the subjects he knows best: the dignity of work, the difficulty of love, the friction between the present and the past. \\\"I found myself going back,\\\" he says, explaining the direction he chose to take, \\\"to family and close personal relations.\\\" The opening cut, \\\"It Takes a Lifetime\\\", so loose and summery and optimistic, invites us into this circle of kindred souls, instantly making us feel at home. And while Isbell may be singing about himself or someone else whose inner life he's privy to when he mentions fighting 'the urge to live inside my telephone,' isn't that everyone's challenge nowadays?\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you've cleaned up your act, what should your next action be, and your next? That's one of the questions handled in \\\"24 Frames\\\", the album's bracing second cut, whose narrator seems to be managing life deliberately, step by step, with peril all around. \\\"You thought God was an architect. Now you know/ He's something like a pipe bomb ready to blow.\\\" The danger of self-destruction is always near, and the way to defeat it seems to be putting self-seeking and vanity aside and taking the next right action, however simple. \\\"After you've looked your fears in the eye,\\\" Isbell tells me on the phone, \\\"What's important now?\\\" Maybe he knows and maybe he's still learning \u2013 this isn't an album of easy certainties \u2013 but what makes his songwriting so rich and gripping, besides its observational precision, is the honesty of his inquiries. He doesn't flinch. He doesn't cheat.\\r\\nThe album \u2013 and it is an album, a unified musical document, not a grab bag of would-be singles (\\\"I don't write songs to be played at sporting events,\\\" Isbell cracks) \u2013 relaxes and deepens as it goes along, offering some of the pleasures of a fine novel, including a collection of sharp vignettes that stick in the mind, impossible to shake. \\\"Flagship\\\", a spare and haunting meditation on the fragility of long-term love, ranges around a faded, old hotel for images of passion that has cooled. \\\"The lights down in the lobby, they don't shine/ They just flicker while the elevator whines.\\\" \\\"Children of Children\\\", a masterful creation that floods the ears with bold and rolling soundscapes reminiscent of CSNY, finds the singer examining old family photos and dwelling on his own unwitting influence on his mother's interrupted youth. \\\"I was riding on my mother's hip/she was shorter than the corn. And all the years you took from her/just by being born.\\\" That last line is as devastating as they come, a thought that, once voiced, can't be forgotten \u2013 and that we're surprised wasn't voiced before. Isbell's songwriting is like that, at its most poetic when it's most plainspoken. His lines and his lyrics fall into place like the tumblers of a lock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title track, which he tells me on the phone was inspired by his father -- a hard-working man who won't let up -- is more than a tribute to a beloved parent; it speaks to the outlook of a generation that has seen, in Isbell's words, \\\"The American dream go from the light at the end of a tunnel to all tunnel.\\\" As usual, Isbell travels outward from the specific case to a more comprehensive human perspective. \\\"I start with an individual, he says, \\\"and then I try to write for everybody.\\\" The song nails its subject from the moment it begins. \\\"When I get home from work, I'll call up all my friends/ and we'll bust up something beautiful we'll have to build again.\\\" The man in question, a born provider who finds himself on Sunday \\\"too tired to go to church,\\\" is politically conscious of his situation (\\\"The hammer needs the nail, and the poor man's up for sale\\\") but grateful for what he's able to bring home. In this, he's like Isbell, who told me that in his writing he tries \\\"to be angry without being bitter and emotional without being maudlin.\\\" He probably doesn't have to try too hard. For all the darkness that leaks into his songs (only because it exists out in the world) Isbell's fundamental orientation is still toward the light, even when it's fast receding. His humanity has an almost uncanny feel, as though he's lived three lives for everybody else's one. He believes in the basic power of his vocation as a writer, singer, player, and artist to conjure wholeness from a world of fragments. He's the musician we need now, and whom we've waited for: candid, vulnerable, outraged, literate, and just romantic enough to carry on in a period of rising disenchantment. His time has come, and so has ours. Listening to Isbell we also hear ourselves.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":296,\"height\":400},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":296,\"height\":400},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":296,\"height\":400},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":270},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-og.jpg\",\"width\":296,\"height\":400},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":135},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":296,\"height\":400},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":296,\"height\":400},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/47/27-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":296,\"height\":400}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KlBDlPPZBE8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.jasonisbell.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/jasonisbellmusic\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/jasonisbellmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/JasonIsbell\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"JasonIsbell\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1679613,\"name\":\"Will Johnson\",\"startTime\":\"2016-11-30 19:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"Will Johnson\u2019s latest solo album, Swan City Vampires, is distinguished by its immediacy and intimacy. Crisp, measured acoustic guitars cushion the Austin-based singer-songwriter\u2019s equally precise, conspiratorial vocals, while keening pedal steel, droning electric guitars, and the occasional askew keyboard add color. The results fall somewhere in the cracks between Neil Young and Crazy Horse noise hurricanes, road-worn folk songs, and low-key alt-country barnstorming.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore tellingly, Swan City Vampires begins with a bracing, two-minute instrumental track, \u201cParadise, Basically.\u201d Jagged electric guitar chords ripped apart by distortion and static dominate the song, aggression that\u2019s tempered by an unsettled, minor-key piano melody hovering just underneath the surface. It\u2019s not necessarily the easiest entry into an album, but make no mistake: This tone and sound\u2014which Johnson describes as \u201cpretty ugly\u201d\u2014is entirely deliberate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe album is a little reckless out of the gate, with the first song, and I wanted that to be the case,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted there to be some discomfort, some uncertainty and some oddity.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one sense, this approach is the result of Johnson\u2019s diverse musical collaborations\u2014including Monsters Of Folk with My Morning Jacket\u2019s Jim James and Bright Eyes\u2019 Conor Oberst; Overseas with David Bazan and Matt and Bubba Kadane; and a duo project with the late Jason Molina. However, Swan City Vampires\u2019 tension and doubt more obviously reflect the changes Johnson himself went through, both personally and professionally, as the album took shape. In early 2014, his mother passed away, while later that year, his band of nearly 20 years, Centro-matic, called it a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these events are referenced directly on Swan City Vampires. The melancholic, piano-curled \u201c(Made Us Feel Like) Kings\u201d is an elegy for his group\u2019s musical achievements, while \u201cThe Watchman\u201d is a tribute to his late mother. The latter song is particularly poignant: It blooms from slightly frayed acoustic guitar and lilting sonic whirrs into a barrage of electric guitar pelted with distraught keyboard zaps\u2014conveying the messiness of emotional catharsis, where grief and relief combine in imperfect ways.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhen the record was coming together, I was dealing with loss and a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cIt was a strange time, emotionally. I didn\u2019t necessarily know what I wanted the album to transmit. There was a lot of raw emotion flying around. For the first time, I didn\u2019t have some sort of grand picture or plan for the whole record. I wanted to get as much down as I could and figure it out later.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps as a result, Swan City Vampire\u2019s recording sessions were brisk and economical. The album was recorded and mixed in two separate three-day sessions with different engineers\u2014John Congleton (The Paper Chase, St. Vincent, Modest Mouse) and Britton Beisenherz (Monahans)\u2014with additional contributions from Phosphorescent\u2019s Ricky Ray Jackson and Johnson\u2019s long-time creative foil, drummer Matt Pence. It marked the first time Johnson had ever done a record in this split-session fashion. \u201cI was a little self-aware that it might have a patchwork quilt kind of feel to it,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut it wound up still feeling cohesive to me once I put all the songs together and sequenced them.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes this cohesion even more remarkable is that Swan City Vampire\u2019s songs were written during different points in Johnson\u2019s life. Several date from as far back as six years ago, when he was living in a little frame house in Bastrop, Texas, before he was married and became a father; others emerged more in the present-day, \u201cright near the finish line\u201d of the album. \u201cThere are some different perspectives, I suppose, in the writing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe writing itself came from different viewpoints\u2014or different vistas.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Swan City Vampires does have some common thematic threads, including working through restlessness and major life changes, and trying to figure out what\u2019s next after the familiar\u2019s been displaced. Yet more than ever, Johnson is comfortable embracing the unfamiliar\u2014as he does on the forthright \u201cYou vs. Off The Cuff,\u201d when he sings the lyric, \u201cHow perfect it is to see you again.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve never sung a line like that,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cIt made me uncomfortable demoing it for the first time, but in a good way\u2014in a way that I was finally unafraid to sing a line like that. There have been a lot of phases of my songwriting life where I probably would\u2019ve rolled my eyes and turned away from that. But for whatever reason, with all that was going on in my personal life, at the time it felt exactly right to sing a line like that.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSome nice words\u2026\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWill Johnson is one of my favorite songwriters on Earth, and this album is as literate and addictive as any of his previous work. These songs are honest and specific while remaining open to multiple layers of interpretation. The melodies are beautiful and memorable, and Will\u2019s voice is a complex and delicate instrument. As a long-time fan, it makes me happy to know that Will is still challenging himself to make music that truly can be called art.\u201d \u2013 Jason Isbell\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cSwan City Vampires, the new solo album from former Centro-matic frontman Will Johnson finds him in peak form. At times as beautiful and melodious as he\u2019s ever been, at others with a primal immediacy beyond anything I\u2019ve ever heard him do. Raw and urgent, this album is a thing of immense beauty that only gets better with each repeated listen. This could end up being my favorite album he\u2019s ever made.\u201d \u2013 Patterson Hood (Drive-By Truckers)\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cSwan City Vampires is another fantastic release from Will Johnson. It\u2019s melancholy, hazy but hopeful. It\u2019s tuneful, complex, and beautiful. At times it seems to me like a fever dream, but with sudden stunning moments of clarity. I\u2019ve been listening to it a lot in the early mornings, but I think it\u2019s also a dusk record, as it\u2019s shadows reveal new things each time. Scary like a vampire, pretty like a swan, buzzing like a city.
