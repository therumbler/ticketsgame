Hall\",\"startTime\":\"2016-11-19 20:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"<iframe width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q486gUjJrmo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an eleven year old, playing harmonica beside his father in South Carolina, music quickly became Trevor\u2019s most intimate companion, guide and creative outlet. In his elementary years, he began to write his own songs and perform them locally. At sixteen he recorded his first record, and the following year he left South Carolina to study classical guitar at Idyllwild Arts Academy, an international boarding school east of Los Angeles. There, Trevor was introduced to yoga and certain spiritual practices found in India, which greatly influenced his music and his life journey. During his senior year, Trevor signed a record deal with Geffen Records and his career as a musician formally began.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevor quickly broke through the music scene, with such early accomplishments in his career as having a song recorded on the Shrek the Third soundtrack, as well as joining a series of sold-out tours with artists such as Steel Pulse, The Wailers, Jimmy Cliff, Matisyahu, Michael Franti, SOJA, Brett Dennen and Colbie Callait. Trevor\u2019s quick rise on the scene, however, was ripe with challenges that conflicted with his spiritual life and devotional practice. In order to parallel his life\u2019s path with the messages in his music, Trevor moved into a traditional Hindu ashram in Southern California in 2008. When not on tour, he lived as a monk and devoted his days to spiritual practice and service. His involvement with the temple affected his music and his music quickly became his practice.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevor Hall\u2019s music \u2013 an eclectic mix of acoustic rock, reggae and Sanskrit chanting \u2013 echo with the names and teachings of divinities, while maintaining an incredibly and refreshingly universal message. While on the road, Trevor sees the stage as his moving temple, a place where he can share in the experience of his spiritual journey with his audience. Trevor\u2019s annual trips to India also continue to serve as a source of creativity and motivation for his music. The precious lessons and experiences that he has harvested from his journeys East have moved Trevor to return a service to those whom have colored his music and his life so beautifully. Trevor uses donations collected at his live shows to help support an ashram in Allahabad, India, the home of his Guru, where underprivileged and orphaned boys and girls are given the chance at a better life and a traditional Vedic education.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 at the age of 26, after touring consistently for ten years, Trevor decided to take a break from the stage and go on an extended pilgrimage to India. There he spent many weeks studying under a classical Baul musician born and trained in the villages of Bengal. Trevor returned from his trip and retreated deep into the green mountains of Vermont and Maine where he spilled all that he had learnt onto the page and into song.\\r\\n\\r\\nHall has released a successful series of musical albums. In 2009, Hall released his Vanguard Records debut, a self-titled album, which featured the single \u201cUnity,\u201d written and performed with his longtime friend, Matisyahu. His follow up album, Everything, Everytime, Everywhere, debuted on the iTunes Rock Chart at #3, iTunes Top Albums at #12 and #8 on Amazon Movers & Shakers. The featured single, \u201cBrand New Day\u201d was used as the music bed for the CBS This Morning Show. Hall\u2019s 2014 release, Chapter of the Forest, debuted at #3 on the iTunes Singer/songwriter Chart and #17 on the iTunes Top Albums Chart.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis latest album, KALA, written in Hawaii and recorded in LA, was released August 21st, 2015. It debuted at #2 on the iTunes singer/songwriter chart.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://trevorhallmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/trevorhall\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/trevorhall\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/trevorhallmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"trevorhallmusic\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1683459,\"name\":\"Dustin Thomas\",\"startTime\":\"2016-11-19 19:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"<iframe width=\\\"450\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJF4yzi1P8c\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nBig hair, big smiles, and a whole lot of love- Wild-hearted globe-trotter Dustin Thomas is making waves from America to Australia with his infectious blend of beat-box/soul-folk.
