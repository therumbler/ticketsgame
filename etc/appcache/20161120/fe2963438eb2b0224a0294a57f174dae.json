They also raise a series of challenging questions. After four decades of heavy use, does punk rock still have any life left in it? Do Keith Morris and his gang of grown-ass punk heroes still have the goods?\\r\\n\\r\\nThey've answered their own questions with a resounding yes through a packed itinerary of shows and a handful of recordings that are among the rawest musical experiences of the new decade. Combining reckless improvisational energy with the combined skills of four deadly sharp musicians, OFF! have dug down through a decades' worth of accumulated stylistic garbage, and rediscovered the stripped down core of noise, speed, and rock & roll that punk seemed to have lost forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir third full-length studio recording, Wasted Years, is the most direct and in-your-face embodiment of OFF!'s mission yet. Recorded in their practice space, live to 8-track 1/2\\\" tape--with the barest minimum of rehearsal beforehand and enough mic bleed to make punching in over rough spots afterward an impossibility--the album captures the group (Morris, guitarist Dimitri Coats, bassist Steven McDonald, and drummer Mario Rubalcaba) in the spontaneous act of bringing its 16 songs to frenzied life. Listening to it is like jumping into the middle of one of the most chaotic and electrifying creative musical environments on Earth, where Cuban rhythms and Sabbath riffs collide with the energy of a California circle pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSearingly loud, frantically paced, and best taken in a single 23-minute dose, Wasted Years is a sonic cinder block, a clenched fist raised in the face of rock & roll refinement.

This is something Plague Vendor has learned. The foursome, who emerged from a practice space in Whittier, CA in 2009, started by playing endless live shows around Southern California, filling everywhere from backyard parties to clubs to festivals with their raucous, formidable music. At the heart of every show, no matter the venue, was sincere energy and spirit, always resulting in a snarling, frenetic performance. The shows stacked up, accumulating every year, and eventually birthed Plague Vendor's 2014 debut album Free To Eat, a dark, thrashing collection that clocked in at less than twenty minutes. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut the album, brash and aptly terse, was just an appetizer to the main course. The band's sophomore effort, Bloodsweat, vastly expands on the sonic territory explored in their debut. Recorded over the course of two weeks in April of 2015 with producer and engineer Stuart Sikes (The Walkmen, Cat Power, Modest Mouse), the album takes a natural approach to Plague Vendor's music. The musicians aimed to capture each track in as few takes as possible, avoiding many overdubs and embracing the same minimal production they bring to their live performances. Nearly all of the eleven songs on Bloodsweat were heavily road-tested, imagined and re-imagined live before ever making it into the studio. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom opening number \\\"Anchor To Ankles\\\" to closer \\\"Got It Bad,\\\" Bloodsweat reveals a purposeful narrative arc, taking the listener through songs that veer rapidly from aggressive thrash to melodic introspection. Together, the songs recount the last few years of the musicians' lives, revealing the sacrifices they've made and the dedication they've embraced to become the band they've become. \\\"Jezebel,\\\" the disc's flagship single, exemplifies the style Plague Vendor has dubbed \\\"voodoo punk\\\" a dance-fueled rock aesthetic tinged with shadowy darkness. The band's influences, which range from At the Drive-In to Liars to The Cramps, are apparent but not overly obvious throughout. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlague Vendor's live show has shifted as they've developed these new songs, too. They've swapped out shock value for raw vulnerability onstage and the four musicians aim to create the most sound and the most intensity with the least possible utility and equipment. Palpable tension comes from the sense that anything could happen, but mostly Plague Vendor is interested in simplicity and the sort of expressive nakedness that can come from stripping everything away. It's clear the band has sacrificed their formative don't-give-a-fuck punk attitude for sincerity and gratitude, acknowledging the fans who've helped them arrive here now. \\r\\n\\r\\nBloodsweat invokes its own name as it unfurls, its songs edged with a sense of danger and vulnerability. It's the product of a band who have traveled far and whose travels have committed them even further to themselves. As you hear it, as its songs surge outward, it announces: This is who Plague Vendor is now. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlague Vendor is:\\r\\n\\r\\nBrandon Blaine \u2013 Vocals\\r\\nLuke Perine \u2013 Drums\\r\\nMichael Perez \u2013 Bass\\r\\nJay Rogers \u2013 Guitar\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atjmbo.PNG\",\"width\":530,\"height\":334},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atjmbo1.PNG\",\"width\":530,\"height\":334},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atlg.PNG\",\"width\":300,\"height\":189},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atlg1.PNG\",\"width\":300,\"height\":189},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atmd.PNG\",\"width\":200,\"height\":126},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atmd1.PNG\",\"width\":200,\"height\":126},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-og.PNG\",\"width\":530,\"height\":334},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atsm.PNG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":63},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atsm1.PNG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":63},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-sq.PNG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-sqsm.PNG\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atxl.PNG\",\"width\":500,\"height\":315},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atxl1.PNG\",\"width\":500,\"height\":315},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atxxl.PNG\",\"width\":530,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/43-atxxl1.PNG\",\"width\":530,\"height\":334}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.plaguevendor.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/PLAGUEVENDOR\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/PlagueVendor\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"PlagueVendor\"},{\"id\":1766847,\"name\":\"The Cr\u00fcd G\u00fcns\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Crudguns?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1325567?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
