decades after the inception of X, one thing is clear: X was not only one of the most influential bands to crash out of the punk movement of the late \u201870s, but the band\u2019s music continues to be sonically groundbreaking today. Songs written during the group\u2019s inception are as relevant and inventive today as they were in 1977.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is, no one sounds like X and no one ever will.\\r\\nIt\u2019s not surprising when you consider the group\u2019s unique beginnings, which can only be attributed to fate. On the same day with nearly the exact same wording, two want-ads appear in a local music rag. One was sent in by a guitarist named Billy Zoom, the other by bassist who called himself John Doe.\\r\\nZoom, a rockabilly rebel who\u2019d performed with Gene Vincent, had read a negative review of a band called the Ramones. It said they only played three chords and they played \u2018em too fast. So naturally, he went to see them. The show was at the Golden West Ballroom in the L.A. suburb of Norwalk in early \u201977, and as soon as the Ramones started to perform, Zoom realized that, musically, he\u2019d found exactly what he wanted to do with his life.\\r\\nDoe, who was originally from the Baltimore area, was already down with the East Coast CBGB\u2019s scene and by the time the two got in the same room together after responding to each other\u2019s ads, it seemed it was meant to be. They performed a few shows with various drummers before a poet with no ambition of being a singer would enter the picture.\\r\\nDoe found her in Venice Beach, at a poetry reading. He liked her poems so much he offered to perform them in his band. The poet, Exene Cervenka, had just moved to town from Florida and she told him, no offense, but if anyone was gonna perform her poems, it would be her, and she soon ended up in the band. Zoom was skeptical about someone\u2019s girlfriend being in the band. After they did their first show with Exene, he didn\u2019t know exactly what it was she had, but he knew it was magic. \\r\\nAfter a succession of drummers, Doe was at the underground punk club the Masque in Hollywood one night, checking out a band called the Eyes, which featured a pre-Go-Go\u2019s bass player named Charlotte Caffey. He called Zoom immediately and said he\u2019d found their drummer. Doe told him he played with a parade snare and hit it hard as a hammer. Zoom told him to promise him anything. His name was D.J. Bonebrake and he quickly signed on. The band was now complete, and X would soon emerge from the young punk scene as one of its most successful offspring.\\r\\nThe band\u2019s early albums, Los Angeles (1980), produced by Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Wild Gift (1981), and Under the Big Black Sun (1982) explored dark love and an even darker L.A. with the unflinching eye of a Raymond Chandler novel. Doe and Cervenka would marry and later divorce, but they\u2019d always remain soulmates. As they released each ensuing album, More Fun in theNew World(1983) and Ain\u2019t Love Grand (1985), the band continued to grow sonically and politically, fearlessly mixing genres without ever losing its center. As each member went on to explore diverse careers\u2014careers that included acting, art, writing, producing and multiple side projects.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atjmbo.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":364},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atjmbo1.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":364},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atlg.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":218},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atlg1.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atmd.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":146},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atmd1.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-og.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":364},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atsm.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":73},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atsm1.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-sq.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-sqsm.jpeg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atxl.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":364},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atxxl.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":364},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/37/69-atxxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":364}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.xtheband.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/X-the-band-37877887019/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1744823,\"name\":\"Visqueen\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Message To Garcia is a collection of Visqueen songs that represents a rock and roll epitaph to front woman Rachel Flotard's father. After garnering countless fans, reviews, and playing shows with everyone from Guided By Voices, to Cheap Trick, Visqueen appeared to be on the verge of conquering the world. All of that changed when her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Their choice to be together for the duration of his illness would change her direction forever.\\n\\nMr. George E. Flotard was a New York City steamfitter since the mid 1960's. He fought and loved in Hell's Kitchen bars on the West Side, and broke all ten fingers twice. He was a strong, red-headed foreman who ordered holes in the ground and fit miles of pipe in a 1970's Harlem skyline.\\n\\n\\\"A Message To Garcia\\\" is an essay written in 1899 by Elbert Hubbard inspired by the Spanish American War. The story celebrates the initiative of a soldier who is assigned and accomplishes a daunting mission. He asks no questions, makes no objections, requests no help, but gets the job done. Voracious reader as Rachel's dad was, this is the only time he physically handed her something to read rather than just suggest it. Visqueen toured America in a van for months after their first record, King Me came out, and again with their follow up rocker, Sunset On Dateland. Focused and determined to make a go of the impossible, Rachel would call her Dad from the road each day. He'd ask if she was \\\"delivering it\\\". She knew exactly what he meant. And the only answer was \\\"yes\\\".\\n\\nOn April 7th, Rachel caught her dad's last breath in her hands in the Seattle home they shared since 2002.\\n\\n\\\"He was our unrelenting hero for 35 years and never let us drop. These songs are my friends. I wrote them through a long ride of self-conscious anguish and joy. They are braided with sunny, ubiquitous problems and snare drums. They reflect the part of me that wants to be happy and make out with Bad Company.\\\"\\n\\nRachel Flotard has been busy the last few years splitting her time caring for her father and working with Neko Case, lending her bold, original voice to Neko's recent albums Middle Cyclone and Fox Confessor Brings The Flood. Here, Ms. Case returns backing vocal favors on Message To Garcia, joining a spectacular cast of unusual collaborators from pedal steel wizard Jon Rauhouse, to The Fastbacks and The Long Winters.\\n\\nThe result? A gigantic sing-a-long record with gangs of handclaps, hooks that kill, and the exalted blessing of electric guitars and cello.\\n\\nProduced by Rachel Flotard with her King Me cohort, Barrett Jones (Nirvana, Foo Fighters), Message To Garcia is the debut album on Flotard's new independent record label, Local 638 Records, inspired by her dad's New York City Steamfitters union. \\n\\nAs her dad always asked, Visqueen is proud to deliver it, with Message To Garcia!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":900},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-og.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":900},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":900},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/57/67-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.visqueenonline.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/visqueen\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Visqueen/60365776116\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.thecrocodile.com/event/1350043?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
