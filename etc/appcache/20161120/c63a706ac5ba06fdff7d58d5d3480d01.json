In 2013 Kellogg gave a TEDx Talk about job satisfaction. Recently on a tour of Europe, SK (as fans often refer to him) made a detour to play the Middle East, Africa and an aircraft carrier for the Armed Forces. Upon returning to the USA, he started his annual lyric writing campaign to raise money and awareness in the fight against pediatric cancer. At first glance none of this has anything to do with his music, but Stephen Kellogg would argue, \\\"it is the whole story. The music I make is a reflection of how I spend my time and what I care deeply about.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to performing, CBS Radio has called Stephen, \\\"the best live act you've never seen.\\\" Another writer at No Depression magazine gives him the oddly flattering title of \\\"the best songwriter you're not listening to.\\\"  Interestingly though while Kellogg may not be a household name at present, he has persisted in building a substantial career, which has landed him on stage with some of the biggest touring acts in the country (Train, Sugarland, OAR, Josh Ritter to name a few), in the billboard charts, and with his songs as the backdrop of numerous films and TV shows (One Tree Hill, Men of a Certain Age, Mercy). Perhaps most importantly to Kellogg, he's ingratiated himself into the lives of his listeners. That sort of mentality has garnered him descriptions like this one from Macaroni Kid, \\\"an unassuming manner, self-deprecating humor, a heart for those around him\u2026100% genuine and utterly moving.\\\" His Americana-tinged, sometimes folk, often rock, occasionally pop stylings can make Kellogg hard to define, and his most recent four part album \\\"South, West, North, East\\\" embraces the notion of genre splitting to the fullest.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecorded literally \\\"all over the map\\\", the premise of \\\"South, West, North, East\\\" was to record each section of the album in a different region of the USA, with different co-producers and different groups of musicians. \\\"I've never felt that the genre was as important as the message and making the record this way was a chance to really explore that idea.\\\" The end result is a collection of 20 songs that defy categorization. The Southern rock flavor of \\\"South\\\" (recorded in Nashville and Atlanta) slides into the cowboy motif of \\\"West\\\" (recorded on a farm in Boulder, CO); and the more indie rock feel of \\\"North\\\" (recorded in a cabin in Woodstock, NY) gives way to the songwriter pop of \\\"East\\\" (recorded in Washington DC). \\\"You often hear about the importance of  'picking a lane' and while I completely understand the marketing savvy and focus of that concept, I picked my lane a long time ago; it's called the 'words that describe what I believe to be true' lane.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1242},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":388},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":259},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-og.jpg\",\"width\":1275,\"height\":1650},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":129},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":647},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":841},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/84/89-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://stephenkellogg.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/sk6ers\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/StephenKelloggMusic/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Stephen_Kellogg\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Stephen_Kellogg\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1719545,\"name\":\"Megan Burtt\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Megan Burtt was born and bred in Denver, CO.  \u201cI\u2019ve always written songs,\u201d she says. \u201cI took piano lessons when I was young, but when I picked up my dad\u2019s old classical guitar, things took off.\u201d  Inspired by Joni Mitchell\u2019s Blue, Burtt taught herself to play, dreaming of a musical career. \u201cI didn\u2019t know any girls who played music, but Blue, Bonnie Raitt\u2019s Nick of Time and the women on the MTV videos I saw, let me know it was possible.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBurtt attended the Berklee School of Music in Boston. There she made two EPs she calls her \u201cpractice records.\u201d \u201cAs soon as I met other musicians, I put together a band and started playing\u201d. We took every gig we could get. I loved being on stage with such talented players. It developed my ear, made my guitar playing more solid and made me a confident bandleader and performer.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she graduated from Berklee, Burtt moved to Mississippi to investigate the roots of American blues music. While there, she contracted a potentially fatal disease, but she never stopped singing or performing, and eventually found her way to full recovery. She played music in Vietnam for a couple of months, then returned to the States to record It Ain\u2019t Love, a 12 song collection she made with the friends that still make up the backbone of her recording band  \u2013 Louis Cato, guitarist Adam Tressler and James Williams. One of the songs on the album, \u201cWaiting for June,\u201d won Best Song at the 2010 Rocky Mountain Folk Festival and the 2011 Kerrville New Folk Competition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, Burtt began writing and pre-production on the songs that would become The Bargain, produced by Louis Cato (Bobby McFerrin, Marcus Miller, Snarky Puppy, Mariah Carey) a talented multi-instrumentalist, and long time member of Burtt\u2019s backing band.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter two years of careful production, The Bargain arrives on August 25th, 2015 to show off Cato\u2019s creative production and Burtt\u2019s bold vocals. \u201cIt\u2019s more honest and evolved than my first album,\u201d Burtt says. \u201cI\u2019m beyond excited to start sharing these songs with my fans.
