DeWyze\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Lee DeWyze launched the pivotal stage of what was already a high-profile musical career with his Vanguard Records debut \u2013Frames, in the summer of 2013. What followed was a high-caliber list of praise from the LA Times, Chicago Tribune, Yahoo Music, Rolling Stone, and dozens upon dozens more. \\\"I hunkered down and wrote an album,\\\" the Chicago native explains. \\\"I wanted to take it back to what I'm really about, which is writing emotionally charged, meaningful songs. It wasn't like I wanted to find a label and then decide what kind of album to make. I knew what kind of album I wanted to make and knew I could make. It's going back to the kind of music I've always loved. I grew up listening to Cat Stevens, Simon & Garfunkel\u2014folk-based acoustic music. Don't get me wrong\u2014my experience on the show was great. But for someone like me and the kind of music I make, that only takes you so far. It feels really good to get back to the grass roots of what I'm about. The way I see it, everything that's happened throughout my career has happened so that I can make this record.\\\"The show DeWyze is referring to is American Idol, which he won in 2010. DeWyze played guitar, piano, mandolin, banjo and drums during the recording sessions, during which he collaborated with renowned producer/songwriters Toby Gad, Drew Pearson, Matthew Wilder and Phil Allen, as well as mixer extraordinaire Jim Scott. \\\"I've never felt a connection with my music, more than I do right now,\\\" DeWyze says, making no effort to hide his excitement. \\\"It's a very real thing, and it feels right.\\\"Frames garnered many licenses and syncs and proved that DeWyze was not only a great singer, but an extremely talented song-writer. Shows like Nashville, Reign, and Hart of Dixie all used his music, as did ESPN, and several independent films. Blue Cross Blue Shield recently used the song 'Don't Be Afraid\\\" as part of their national 2014/2015 campaign. However, the door really kicked open when Lee penned the song 'Blackbird Song' for The Walking Dead in March of 2014. An original song that he wrote specifically for the show itself. Blackbird Song has accumulated over 50k single unit sales, 2M collective YouTube views, and has over 1.1M Spotify streams. The song is considered one of the top 10 syncs of the 2014 by the Music Guild Association. In 2015, DeWyze will release an onslaught of music and video content, and continue his relentless touring here in the US and overseas. Lee has a #1 song in Ireland called Lullaby that was recorded and performed by Ronan Keating. He also has a #3 song in Italy called Magnetic Heart recorded and performed by Marco Mengoni.\\\"I'm finally in the lane I belong in, and I feel like I can just go.\\\" DeWyze says in anticipation of what he's preparing to unleash in 2015\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1440},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-og.jpg\",\"width\":1365,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":975},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/47/13-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.leedewyzeofficial.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/leedewyze\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/LeeDeWyze\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"LeeDeWyze\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1141659,\"name\":\"Leslie DiNicola\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Nationally acclaimed singer-songwriter Leslie DiNicola has a rare gift for the sonic snapshot\u2014through the poetic accessibility of her writing style she captures personal moments with a universal perspective.\\n\\\"I want to share my experiences in song so that others can see their lives mirrored and pass through the door of whatever is troubling them or holding them back,\\\" the NYC-based artist explains. Each of Leslie's releases is a photo journal, a collection of \\\"in the moment,\\\" unposed music portraits that reveal the core of herself and her artistry. Her latest, the EP Some Greener Yard, is her most well composed and elegantly revealing body of work.\\nLeslie has been frequently described as \\\"combining the grittiness of Janis Joplin with the vulnerability of Alison Krauss.\\\" It's a potent sensibility that has endeared her to critics, fans, other established artists, and industry vets. Things To Do, See & Eat in NYC succinctly enthuses: \\\"This girl is going places.\\\" October Project's Julie Flanders says: \\\"DiNicola pours her full soul and tremendous heart into songs you will recognize for their mysterious way of telling your secret story with her powerful voice.\\\" Leslie has worked with such respected music biz names as Ron Allaire (Keith Richards, Madonna, David Bowie, Shakira), Julian Coryell (Aimee Mann, Leonard Cohen, Jewel, Alanis Morisette), Erich Gobel (John Mayer, Ray Charles), Mark Schulman (P!nk, Cher, Foreigner), and Ellis Traver (Diane Birch, Fischerspooner, Sean Lennon, and Mark Ronson).\\nAs a live performer, her commanding vocals and smoldering stage presence have enabled her to sell out solo shows and hold her own alongside renowned artists like Howie Day, Anna Nalick, Tyler Hilton, Jaymay and October Project. Leslie is also a highly in-demand artist singing the \\\"National Anthem\\\" at major league sporting events across the country.\\nLeslie experienced a creative watershed time period recording her previous EP, Draw Back Your Bow (2011). This was a sophisticated and imaginative covers collection that resonated deeply with the public, and her mesmerizing renditions of Journey's \\\"Separate Ways\\\" and U2's \\\"With Or Without You\\\" peaked on the CMJ charts all over the country. Simply put: Studying world-class pop songs helped Leslie become a sharper and more expressive songwriter. \u2028\u2028There is a gracefulness to her last five-song collection; Some Greener Yard feels quaint, emotionally direct, and hopeful. The elegantly elegiac \\\"Weight\\\" tenderly salutes a deceased friend. The redemptive \\\"It's Alright\\\" features pastoral folk guitars and subtle gospel-y organs and sends a message of love and warmth to a friend who lost her father. And the euphoric Motown-esque-meets-1980s new wave \\\"Stay\\\" brightens the EP with the uplifting message that people can always fall in love and still feel that childlike wonder of new relationships.\\nWake Up is Leslie's third project with Julian Coryell, and he has been an essential artistic ally during this period of her career. \\\"Julian doesn't allow anything between me and the song except the truth,\\\" she explains. With this six-song collection, DiNicola dove deeply into experimenting with production and vocal layering. And the results are magnificent. Each song combines the emotionally resonant lyrics that her fans adore with wildly sophisticated and catchy melodies that will echo in your head\u2026 and heart for days. Wake Up is DiNicola's greatest accomplishment to date.\\n\\\"When I look back at the work I've done, it's like going through scrapbooks,\\\" Leslie says thoughtfully. \\\"Each song is like a photograph of the person I was in a particular moment. It tells a story that my soul needed to tell. I hope these songs comfort people and give them an inherent sense of hope against life's sorrow\u2026 because that's why I listen to music. And that's why I write music.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://lesliedinicola.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/lesliedinicola\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/lesliedinicola\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"lesliedinicola\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.thedoordallas.com/event/1317943?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
