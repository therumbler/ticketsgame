An exquisite and high energy live performance has taken him across the world, leaving onlookers captive until he exits the stage. His songs and are known for their heavy hitting beats beats under inspired melodies paired with Sape's rhymes which matchless in delivery and wit. Music is Sapient's element and there is nothing comparable to witnessing him in the midst of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Sapient is one of those rare hip hop artists who manages to sound completely unique and fresh\\\"\\r\\n- NYLON Magazine\\r\\n\\r\\nComing up as a graffiti writer and beat hustler, his art has ripened into more complex levels of musicality, and branched out into graphic design, illustration, and videography. He is a husband and father to three kids who have inspired and fuelled an uncanny level of grit, turning him into the creator and producer who can and does do it all. With a sought after sound of indie influenced beats, often incorporating samples, live instrumentation, and heavy drums that leave sore necks as the by-product of rigorous head nodding, he is Northwest Hip Hop's most innovative voice and greatest renaissance man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Sapient will never let himself be confined within the box of a single genre.\\\" \\r\\n- Portland Deli\\r\\n\\r\\nSapient was born into music and has dabbled in multiple instruments for as far back as he can remember. After being busted for graffiti charges at 18, he took to rapping over his own beats made with a drum machine, a guitar, and an 8-track. This early training blossomed into a distinctive sound of multi-textured arrangements that are structured with the sense of a songwriter. Sapient's beats have re-defined the sound of Northwest Hip Hop and carried luminary voices from the likes of Macklemore, Aesop Rock, Slug (Atmosphere), Cage, Eyedea and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a vocalist and producer, Sapient has been a member of The Prime (a duo with Living Legends' front man Luckyiam), as well as Portland's Debaser, and is a founding member of the Northwest Hip Hop collective, Sandpeople. He tours frequently, spreading his name across the country as an independent artist, and is always hands on: mixing and mastering, designing visual art, directing videos, and developing his unique brand with an insatiable work ethic.
