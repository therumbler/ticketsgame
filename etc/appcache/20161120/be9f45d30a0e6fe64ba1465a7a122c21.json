Though \u201csing,\u201d however, might not be the most appropriate verbiage \u2013 she belts, more like it, in her dynamic range that can growl soulfully one moment and twangily howl the next. It\u2019s an honest performance from an artist and writer who stands out for the singular point of view, sheer creativity and fearless approach to music she\u2019s developed since she began performing and writing as a young child. Using the boldest colors from across many genres as her palate and country as her canvas, Morris\u2019 stories are vivid paintings that can be gleefully fun, tearfully heartbreaking and a perfect balance of modern and timeless.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the five songs of her EP, it\u2019s easy to discover all of the diverse and dynamic sides that make up Maren Morris \u2013 from the confident, danceable swagger of \u201c80s Mercedes,\u201d to the island jam of \u201cDrunk Girls Don\u2019t Cry,\u201d and the soulful confessions of \u201cWish I Was.\u201d And, of course, the thrilling pop-country-gospel amalgam of \u201cMy Church,\u201d a track that was written while Morris was cruising along in her car listening to the radio and had an epiphany: that here\u2019s something downright spiritual to letting your body and mind be enveloped by the power of music.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI realized, this is my version of church,\u201d she says. \u201cRight after I said it aloud I thought, \u2018I should write that down\u2019! Everyone has that feeling when they are in their car by themselves, listening to music with the windows down. I wanted to capture that in a three minute song \u2013 and it almost fell out of the sky.\u201d It\u2019s no coincidence that a track about letting music take you to church does just that with its infectious melody.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorris was in Los Angeles with writing partner busbee when the idea was born, and the track was crafted in under an hour. \u201cMy Church\u201d calls out some of Morris\u2019 core influences \u2013 Johnny Cash, Hank Williams Sr. \u2013 but is composed as its own unique identity. There are twangy licks amongst a doo-wop beat, held together by her singular vocals. \u201cI took a breath and I knew this was something really special,\u201d Morris says. \u201cIt really embodied everything I represent as an artist and as a writer. And in life.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that\u2019s someone who has been shaping her musical identity since she still had homework to do. Born in Texas, Morris would often dominate the karaoke machine when her parents, who owned a local hair salon, would throw parties \u2013 and she\u2019d belt LeAnn Rimes and Patsy Cline to the bewilderment of guests. Her writing prowess began with stories and poems in school and blossomed into lyrics when her father bought her a guitar at age twelve \u2013 and she took to it instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI started playing all around Texas \u2013 any bar or club that would let me in there,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the only kid in school that had a job on the weekends!\u201d The albums that shaped her early life were varied \u2013 like Patty Griffin, the Dixie Chicks, Sheryl Crow \u2013 but she also grasped quickly that while she loved country and roots music, she felt most at home when bending genre lines. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for her to spin both Clint Black and Chaka Khan, developing into what she calls a \u201cgangster June Carter,\u201d with a laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt barely twenty, she moved to Nashville, leaving behind a resume that boasted three hits on the Texas Music Chart: and while many arrive in town with a dream of their name in lights, resting on the marquees of the biggest and brightest venues, Morris simply wanted to work on her songwriting craft. And it\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t have aspirations as a performer \u2013 Morris had actually already logged years doing just that. But being a celebrity wasn\u2019t the goal \u2013 spending her days and nights in the writing room, working with as many cowriters as possible and composing hundreds of songs, was. And though she\u2019d only play the occasional local gig at first, she still managed to build an audience based on her sheer talent, honest lyrics and a completely magnetic presence. Small shows led to big opening gigs: for Little Big Town, Sam Hunt, Loretta Lynn and Chris Stapleton.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a working songwriter she scored cuts quickly, for artists like Tim McGraw and Kelly Clarkson. And she started shaping a community of likeminded friends leading a new charge in the country climate: the Brothers Osborne, Kacey Musgraves, Lucie Silvas. \u201cIt feels like a modern-day Chelsea Hotel,\u201d she says of her very close, very talented pals. They became a tight knit circle dead-set on helping each other evolve into unique, game-changing artists.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the way, she slowly and carefully started building the bones to her career as a performer again. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conscious decision to be an artist,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was more, am I ready to face my point of view? I would have been happy just being a songwriter, but there was a voice in my head saying, you\u2019ve got to sing these.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so she did. Her self-titled EP gives a hint to what her forthcoming major-label debut on Sony Music Nashville will hold: and that\u2019s one of the more inventive and engaging perspectives in country music to come along in years. The charts and critics agree \u2013 she entered the Billboard Heatseeker\u2019s chart at number one, has been wracking up millions of spins on Spotify and was named one of Rolling Stone Country\u2018s Artists You Need to Know. Because few could find themselves drawing fans of both Bruno Mars and Bonnie Raitt, but Morris could \u2013 taking them to the special, wildly different world where spirituality comes through the FM dial and the stage is a place both to party and pray.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe best part has been going off the beaten path,\u201d Morris says. \u201cI love to weed whack, and create something new. That\u2019s when I feel most alive.\u201d Amen to that.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":308},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":308},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":231},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":154},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-og.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":308},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":77},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":308},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":308},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":308},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/06/23-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":308}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AaBiSLkYIAU\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.marenmorris.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/marenmorris/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/MarenMorris\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"MarenMorris\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.georgiatheatre.com/event/1355509?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
