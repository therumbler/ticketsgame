21:45:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"On \u201cBlood in the Cut\u201d \u2014 the moody and magnetic lead single from her new EP Crush Me \u2014 K.Flay turns emotional damage into unlikely transcendence. \u201cIt\u2019s about inundating yourself with feelings of pain and angst, and how that can be its own form of power,\u201d says Kristine Flaherty, the L.A.-based artist who made her debut as K.Flay with a series of releases in 2010. \u201cThe songs on the EP revolve around the idea of a person or a force seeking to crush you or hold you down, but there\u2019s a defiant energy to them \u2014 like, \u2018Yeah, go ahead and try.\u2019\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first signing to Night Street/Interscope Records (an imprint helmed by Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds), K.Flay instills that energy into a batch of songs highlighting her seamless flow and head-turning lyricism. But while Crush Me builds off K.Flay\u2019s hip-hop background, the EP also channels her punk sensibilities and DIY spirit into a lush but gritty sound rooted in live drums and guitar. \u201cMy live shows always had the spontaneity that comes from working with more organic instrumentation, and I wanted to make sure that was really reflected on this EP,\u201d notes Flaherty, who\u2019s previously toured with artists like Passion Pit, Icona Pop, Awolnation and Theophilus London.\\r\\n\\r\\nEqually inspired by the novels of Marilynne Robinson and Kid Cudi\u2019s early records, Crush Me finds K.Flay delivering her most intensely intimate yet sonically expansive work so far. \u201cMy main imperative was to create something musically interesting and at the same time be completely honest and not censor myself,\u201d she says. Throughout the EP, K.Flay spikes her lyrics with confessional barbs but never loses her breezy cool. On \u201cBlood in the Cut,\u201d for instance, lines like \u201cReading through your messages/My favorite way to die\u201d slip right into the song\u2019s stripped-down arrangement of bright beats and buzzsaw guitars. Named for a cemetery in the heart of Los Angeles, the darkly charged \u201cHollywood Forever\u201d matches K.Flay\u2019s commentary on the toxic nature of fame with her own personal revelations (\u201cMy father was a user/And I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m just the same\u201d). One of Crush Me\u2019s loveliest and most melancholy moments, \u201cDreamers\u201d owns up to feelings of loss and regret but explores the redemptive power of creativity (\u201cSuddenly I felt fine inside a mind so full of ghosts/The darkest nights mean you see the stars the most\u201d). And on the hazy and quietly heartbreaking \u201cYou Felt Right,\u201d K.Flay offsets her lovesick, ripped-from-real-life storytelling with the occasional self-effacing dig (\u201cI should have known don\u2019t trust a poet, \u2018cause they can\u2019t do the math\u201d).\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Crush Me endlessly reveals her easy grace as a songwriter and producer, K.Flay is quick to point out that she \u201cfell into music very haphazardly\u201d at the age of 19 \u2014 a decade after her dad first taught her to play guitar. \u201cI was in an argument with someone and was challenged to make a song, which was really my entry point to music,\u201d says Flaherty, an Illinois native who studied at Stanford University. \u201cFrom there I started producing and playing house parties on campus, kind of as a release from the academic life. I liked that music was a window into a world with a lot of unpredictability and chaos; it was almost diametrically opposed to my very regimented day-to-day living.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon graduating, Flaherty moved to San Francisco and kept up with music, making her breakthrough with the 2011 mixtape I Stopped Caring in \u201996 and soon landing a deal with a major label. Not long after putting out her 2013 EP What If It Is (featuring a collaboration with Danny Brown), K.Flay launched her own label for the release of her full-length debut Life As a Dog (a 2014 album that \u201cpairs spaced-out rap beats and chiming indie rock,\u201d according to Entertainment Weekly). \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve somersaulted into everything that\u2019s happened since I first started making music,\u201d says Flaherty. \u201cIt\u2019s like I kept slowly turning to the right and ended up doing this for a living, which is pretty amazing to me.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn making Crush Me, K.Flay joined forces with Nashville-based producer/musician JT Daly, writing and recording in a converted carriage house deep in the Tennessee countryside. She also worked with LA based producer Simon Says.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth collaborators helped shape the emotionally raw yet complexly layered terrain of Crush Me. \u201cI remember I was leaving the studio in Tennessee really late one night and playing \u2018Hollywood Forever\u2019 super-loud in the car,\u201d says Flaherty, looking back on the making of the EP. \u201cAll of a sudden I was jolted back to the first time I ever pressed my music onto CD, and to putting all the boxes of CDs in my trunk and saying to myself, That\u2019s cool \u2014 I made that. It was this weird joyous feeling, and I\u2019d completely forgotten all about it until that night in Nashville.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor K.Flay, that weird joy surpasses \u201call the crazy adventures\u201d she\u2019s experienced since dedicating herself to music. \u201cThere have been a lot of really high highs and low lows over the years, but the experience of taking nothing and creating something makes me happy and helps me not be anxious or depressed,\u201d she says. \u201cIn and of itself, just the act of making music is still so life-affirming to me.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":720},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":225},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":150},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-og.jpg\",\"width\":2000,\"height\":1500},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":75},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":375},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":488},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/26/27-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.kflay.com/site/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/kflay\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/kflaymusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/kflay\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"kflay\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1738805,\"name\":\"Nightly\",\"startTime\":\"2016-11-18 20:50:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1755185,\"name\":\"Layne\",\"startTime\":\"2016-11-18 20:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"For Layne Putnam, music has always been an autobiographical journey, one influenced as much by her personal \\nexperiences as outside forces. From the growing pains of her days as a budding musician deep in search of her \\ntruest identity and message to her blossomed sound of today, LAYNE represents the evolved stage of the \\nmodern-day artist. \\n\\nPutnam made a name for herself as an undiscovered talent tapped from the far off lands in her hometown in the \\nBlack Hills of South Dakota. Those formative years in the isolated mountain range set the building blocks for the \\nbeginning of the LAYNE style, which was heavily influenced by the geographic imprint of her rural upbringing. \\nFrom the get-go, Putnam has absorbed inspiration from her immediate surroundings and grew up with a \\npenchant for arts, culture, and architecture foreign to many youth her age. Her introduction to music was partly \\ndriven by her musician father, Kenny Putnam, who spent years touring with country icon Roy Clark. It makes \\nsense, then, that for her music became a daily institution. It seemed Putnam was destined for the life of a \\nmusician. \\n\\n\\\"Music has always been the constant in my life,\\\" says Layne Putnam. \\\"It's always been there for me, and it \\nalways will be. It's always been my purpose and reason and the one thing that no one could ever take \\naway from me. Growing up until now, it's been my power, my identity, and my best friend.\\\" \\n\\nAs with any genuine artist, age begets change, and for Putnam that meant a life transforming, cross-country \\nrelocation to her new and current home in Los Angeles. There, through a casual encounter in a coffee shop, \\nPutnam would meet drummer Alexander Rosca, a session player from Portland, OR. They would bond over \\nsimilar tastes in music, style, and similarities in the places they once called home. It's in the City of Angels where \\nthese messengers of music found and perfected their crafty and heartfelt take of indie pop powered by moody, \\nemotion-laden rock. \\n\\nWhereas her South Dakota roots were her sonic foundation, Los Angeles is Putnam's most captivating muse. For \\na spin, take a cue from \\\"Good,\\\" which reflects the spirit of a persevering artist breaking her way into the world \\none song at a time. It's a life path also encapsulated in their breakthrough single, \\\"Somebody,\\\" which captures \\nthe everyday struggles of the starving musician in both audio and visual format via the official music video. \\n\\nNow, with her unfeigned voice in tow and teamed with producer Devon Corey and drummer Alexander Rosca \\ndriving her most critical sound, plus paired with a new home providing a daily inspirational backdrop, LAYNE \\nsets forth with their latest single, \\\"Good\\\", out April 8th via Taste & Tone. \\n\\n\\\"'Good' is a small introduction to some of the music I've been writing over the past year while living in \\nLos Angeles,\\\" says Putnam. \\\"We're all looking to be understood, and this song, along with our EP \\n(expected May), is where we can feel alone together. We call that place the 'In-Between.'\\\" \\n\\nTHE BLACK HILLS EP represents the latest and most entrancing chapter in the book of LAYNE. Time will only tell \\nhow far this burgeoning band will travel in search of the perfect song. What's left is the soundtrack to a life on \\nthe road with never an end in sight.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/laynesounds\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/laynesworld\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Laynesworld_\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Laynesworld_\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://babysallright.ticketfly.com/event/1290379?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
