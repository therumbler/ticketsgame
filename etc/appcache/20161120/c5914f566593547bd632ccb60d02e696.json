Connecting the dots between solo albums is increasingly difficult, and the collective often loses its binding ethos to too many translations. Luckily, Warm Brew continues to fill the void one line at a time.\\r\\n \\r\\nSince 2010\u2019s Natural Spirit, the Dogtown (Santa Monica and Venice) based trio of Ray Wright, Manu Li, and Serk Spliff have committed to recording together. Each project expounds on their singular, forward-thinking West Coast sound and expands their devoted local fanbase. After innumerable hours spent recording at Red Bull Studios in Santa Monica, the beachside group has become the first rap act signed to Red Bull Records. Today, their wave is poised to break far beyond the sands of the Pacific.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn and raised in various Los Angeles locales, the three 20-somethings formed their still unbreakable bond at Santa Monica High. Rap was initially a shared hobby, one flirted with between classes, parties, and trips to the beach. When post-high school plans didn't pan out, however, Warm Brew emerged. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group\u2019s earliest backyard shows remain the stuff of legend. College-aged fans up and down PCH toppled rickety fences and bounced on rooftops as Warm Brew developed their ever-kinetic live show. \u201cIt was like college for us,\u201d Li says. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReally, the shows were a respite from their most turbulent years. Days were spent shuttling between the homes of their respective single mothers; nights were spent sleeping on floors and working graveyard shifts to make rent. Projects such as Kottabos (2012) and The Ride (2013) documented the highs and lows with increasing returns.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cOur biggest influence is the struggle,\u201d Wright explains. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily have to be down to make your best music, but sometimes you make your best music when you\u2019re not in the best headspace.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ride also featured Warm Brew\u2019s biggest single, \u201cWanna Get High.\u201d The swirling, intoxicating smoker\u2019s anthem garnered the attention of L.A. rap luminary Dom Kennedy. In addition to offering free studio time, Kennedy released Warm Brew\u2019s 2015 album, Ghetto Beach Boyz, on his OPM label. The album\u2019s ceaseless, near two-year recording process reaffirmed the group\u2019s unwavering unity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe were fighting, laughing, and sitting there pissed off with one another, but what matters is the fact that we got through that,\u201d says Spliff. \u201cNot a lot of people can get through those parts. We realized that we can do it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince it\u2019s release, Ghetto Beach Boyz has received praise from publications like XXL and LA Weekly. A distinctly modern West Coast rap record, it reverently nods at the sun-soaked G-Funk of old while driving the proverbial lowrider down an entirely new lane. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWarm Brew\u2019s latest offering is the six-track Diagnosis. An assemblage of infectious chords, soulful keys, and layers of progressive percussion, the beats from producers like Swiff D (Schoolboy Q\u2019s \u201cStudio\u201d) and Al B Smoov (Warm Brew\u2019s DJ) make this the trio\u2019s most sonically diverse project yet. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI think we already had a winning formula,\u201d Li says when discussing Diagnosis. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting better.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe improved formula is never more apparent than on the project\u2019s lead single, \u201cThe Mission\u201d (Swiff D). A meditative trip down memory lane, each member displays the kind of growth earned in and outside of the studio. Wright tempers tales of a checkered past with his perfected, Nate-Dogg-like croon on the song\u2019s poignant hook; the ever-charismatic Spliff praises the support of family and friends in a polished double-time; Li laments the dissolution of a friendship with insight and perspective that belie his age. Like the best Warm Brew songs, \u201cThe Mission\u201d confirms the timeless power of true collaboration.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1190},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":372},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":248},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-og.png\",\"width\":1589,\"height\":1969},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":124},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":620},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atxl1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atxxl.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":805},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/81/48-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://warmbrewla.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/warmbrew/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1762987,\"name\":\"Michael Christmas\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Born and raised in Boston, Michael Christmas began his career as a rapper in his early teens and went on to release his debut mixtape, Is This Art?, at age 19 in February 2014.
