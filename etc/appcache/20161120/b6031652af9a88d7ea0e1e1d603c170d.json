While studying composition at SUNY Purchase\u2019s music conservatory, she previously recorded music with a full orchestra. However as college graduation inched closer, Mitski moved away from the concert hall and into the campus\u2019 active DIY scene. Upon relocating to New York following graduation, she entered stages at Death By Audio, Silent Barn, and Bed Stuy basements, entrenching her songs of love, fear, lust, and brilliant clarity into entirely sympathetic ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince releasing Bury Me at Makeout Creek in November 2014 via Brooklyn-based label Double Double Whammy, Mitski has received international acclaim for her distinct, arresting sound and profoundly reflective lyrics. Pitchfork applauded the release as \u201cinventive and resourceful,\u201d while Rolling Stone celebrated her \u201cdeep-cutting lyrics.\u201d NME said of Bury Me, \u201cit\u2019s a record that doesn\u2019t tug at your heart-strings as much as it mercilessly pounds at them, taking to your emotions like a lead pipe to a pi\u00f1ata.\u201d She has also received widespread attention for her \u201ccathartic\u201d live shows as dubbed by The New York Times\u2019 Jon Caramanica.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI was so young when I behaved 25,\u201d Mitski sings on \u201cFirst Love / Late Spring,\u201d \u201cyet now I find I\u2019ve grown into a tall child.\u201d This veritable thesis speaks to sentiments of the poetry and beauty of struggling up the hill to adulthood. Mitski follows El Anatsui\u2019s humbling advice, cathartically revealing snapshots from her adventures in youth, and the empowerment found in sharing these stories with others. In 2015 Mitski is poised to continue delivering her particular flavor of soul-baring rock, and tour throughout North America and beyond.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":641},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-og.jpg\",\"width\":1232,\"height\":823},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/96/29/09-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"http://mitski.bandcamp.com\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://mitski.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/MitskiLeaks\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/MitskiLeaks\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"MitskiLeaks\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":737565,\"name\":\"Fear Of Men\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"2016 sees the return of Fear of Men with \u2018Fall Forever\u2019, an album that builds on the melodicism of their acclaimed debut al- bum \u2018Loom\u2019 and takes it in a bold and modern direction, pushing the limits of their instruments to take on new and alien forms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter extensively touring in support of their acclaimed debut album, Fear of Men decamped in the early months of 2015 to an outbuilding of a disused abattoir in rural Kent, England, to begin work on new material. A two hour bus ride from their native Brighton and a blackhole for cell signal, such an environment was fitting for a band determined to strip their sound back to the bone and build it up to make an album that would, on their live return, \u201cmake the stage shake\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn \u2018Fall Forever\u2019 Fear of Men twisted together sounds and influences from a variety of genres to create their own vision of a dark and modern pop record. Working with producer Tom Morris to gain clarity and presence, they focused on core sounds instead of layers, while still incorporating textures and details that can be discovered upon repeat listens.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtending upon the themes of 'Loom', Jessica Weiss puts forth her own voice, rather than hiding behind metaphor or refer- ences. The result, she says, is a \u201cvery personal and genuine record exploring where my life is at the moment. It feels a lot more exposing than Loom, and it\u2019s been a way for me to process my life.\\\" A vocalist who has proved herself adept at conveying a kaleidoscope of emotions in just a few lines, Weiss juxtaposes the resultant feelings of independence and self-determination with ruminations on reliance and intimacy. Indeed, she calls \u2018Fall Forever\u2019 a love album, but one with themes of strength and independence and one that explores emotional extremes of closeness and distance, love and violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nFear of Men reflects such contrasts in the sonic palette of the album; cold electronics meet lush, breathing textures and fre- netic post-punk drums shudder against undulating guitars that recall the fluidity of shoegaze while stripping it of that genre\u2019s crutch of thick reverb to create a more forceful and contemporary sound. Intent on looking forward, the band utilised mod- ern effects pedals and technology to manipulate their traditional band instruments into new and alien forms. Such an ap- proach can be heard on \u2018Until You\u2019, where frozen guitar chords warp and twist to introduce the song before erupting into a distorted wall of sound for a chorus that hits with the punch of synthesisers but bristles with a human rawness that only gui- tars can bring.\\r\\n\\r\\nFear of Men have pushed themselves to explore new sonic possibilities with their old instruments while pulling back the veils that have previously obscured them and in the process created an album that could only be theirs. 'Fall Forever,\u2019 co-produced by Tom Morris and Daniel Falvey, is out June 3, 2016 on Kanine Records.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/58/23-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.fearofmen.co.uk/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/fearofmen\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/fearofmen\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"fearofmen\"},{\"id\":1562995,\"name\":\"Weaves\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"In a little over two short years, Weaves have gone from a collection of voice memos on Jasmyn Burke's iPhone to establishing themselves as one of the most stridently individual acts to emerge from Toronto's fertile and multifaceted DIY scene. Led by the collaborative efforts of Jasmyn Burke and Morgan Waters, the band have built a devoted audience while capturing the attention of the international media with a brand of ebullient, art-damaged pop music as difficult to categorize as it is to ignore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group began in a series of sessions in the bedroom of Water's Chinatown apartment, where Waters and Burke would record increasingly elaborate demos built from Burke's phone full of songs. They transitioned to a full band line up in late 2013, adding bassist Zach Bines and drummer Spencer Cole, and quickly set to work recording their debut EP which was released on Buzz Records in the summer of 2014. The EP made an immediate splash, garnering praise from Noisey, Rookie and Spin, and earning Weaves a \\\"band to watch\\\" tag from Rolling Stone. Glowing write ups of the band's performances at that year's CMJ from The Guardian and NME followed, cementing Weaves' reputation as one of the year's most exciting new bands. \\r\\n\\r\\nWord continued to spread in 2015 with the release of their single \\\"Tick,\\\" ahead of the band's first European tour, which included dates with Hinds, Dan Deacon and Pissed Jeans, and appearances at Glastonbury and Iceland Airwaves. With their already sterling live show only sharpened by their time on the road, the band returned to CMJ in October and emerged as one of the hottest acts of the festival, earning \\\"best of the festival\\\" write ups from NPR and The New York Times among others, and further building the anticipation for their forthcoming full length. \\r\\n\\r\\nWeaves have been working on their debut LP for almost as long as they have been a band, tracking with Leon Taheny (Dilly Dally, Owen Pallett, Austra) in sessions that span most of the last two years. Mixed by Alex Newport (Death Cab for Cutie, Melvins, At The Drive In) and mastered by John Greenham (Death Grips, Sky Ferreira), the result is an album that traverses the band's history, exploring every facet of their always adventurous approach to pop music and leaving no idea unexplored. Filled beyond bursting with hooks and possibilities, it's the sound of a band propelled forward by the thrill of discovering the limits of their sound and gleefully pushing past them. \\\"We're always trying to push ourselves,\\\" says Waters, \\\"sometimes it feels like bands aren't necessary, like they're not the one's pushing music forward, so I think we're trying to hopefully prove that bands aren't boring. If we are going to be a band and if we are going to do this guitar, bass and drums thing then we might as well see how much we can fuck it up.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":789},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":247},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":164},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1684},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":82},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":411},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":535},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/75/87-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.weavesband.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/weavesmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/weeaves\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"weeaves\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.r5productions.com/event/1272121?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
