Ant\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"It was on a Thursday night, 16th October 1980, when millions of living rooms across the UK, were set on fire by a blazing TV performance by Adam and the Ants.  After 3 ferocious, minutes of \u2018Dog Eat Dog\u2019, on the weekly music show, Top of the Pops, the phenomenon rapidly began and they would go on to dominate the charts with extraordinary success.   \\r\\n\\r\\nBut this was no \u2018overnight success\u2019, Adam Ant had been working hard behind the warpaint and feathers for his moment. The journey had started at Hornsey College of Art, where Adam had teamed up with some college friends to form the band Bazooka Joe. With Adam on bass guitar, they played the pubs and colleges around London and it was on a night in November 1975 that he saw a group that was to change his life forever.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sex Pistols played their first ever gig, supporting Bazooka Joe, at St Martins College of Art and the explosive punk band inspired Adam to start something new.  He formed The Ants and performed live repeatedly at many venues including the Vortex and The Roxy before getting a Thursday night residency at the famous Marquee club in London.  The band built a huge cult following despite being unpopular with the established music press, and in 1979 they released their debut album, Dirk Wears White S\u00f8x, which topped the independent chart on release. It has been said that if Adam and the Ants had appeared on television at this time, then they would have \u2018made it\u2019 but the moderate success made the rest of the band despondent and in early 1980, the Ants left Adam, after an offer to work with the former Sex Pistols manager, Malcolm McLaren.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWith a new sense of freedom and clarity, Adam immediately put his ideas for a new \u2018warrior\u2019 sound into practice and within months had put together a fresh band that included two drummers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new band signed a major label deal and recorded the album \u2018Kings of the Wild Frontier\u2019. Released in November 1980 it became a worldwide hit, spending 12 weeks at number 1. The singles, \u2018Kings of the Wild Frontier\u2019 and \u2018Antmusic\u2019 both hit number 2 in the UK chart and \u2018Dog Eat Dog\u2019 reached number 4. \u201cAntmania\u201d swept the nation and after winning the Brit Award for \u2018Best British Album\u2019, Adam Ant became one of the most publicised faces in Britain. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1981, \u2018Stand and Deliver\u2019 hit the number 1 spot and stayed there for 5 weeks, and became his most successful single, winning him the prestigious Ivor Novello Award For Songwriting. On it\u2019s release, the follow up album and single \u2018Prince Charming\u2019 went straight to number one and a further 12 singles went top 30, at one point, Adam had 8 singles in the top 40. . . in one week!  \\r\\n\\r\\nHe became the first VJ (video jockey) on MTV and at a time when videos were the most popular way to promote music, Adam\u2019s charismatic performances in some of the most lavish visuals of the period paved the way for his acting career. \\r\\n\\r\\nHis first solo album, \u2018Friend or Foe\u2019 continued his success in the USA, delivering 3 top twenty hits on the Billboard Top 100. \u2018Goody Two Shoes\u2019 was also a number 1 in both the UK and Australia and after being voted \u2018Sexiest Man Alive\u2019 by the viewers of MTV, he celebrated this success in the USA with a \u2018Best New Artist\u2019 Grammy nomination.\\r\\n\\r\\n In 1983 he appeared on NBC Television Network\u2019s \u2018Motown 25 Special\u2019, alongside Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. The second solo album \u2018Strip\u2019 produced the top 5 UK hit \u2018Puss \u2018n Boots\u2019 but the follow-up single \u2018Strip\u2019 and the sexy spectacular video was banned by the BBC.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile recording his third solo album \u2018Vive Le Rock\u2019 with legendary producer, Tony Visconti, Adam set out on an acting career by appearing in a theatre production of Joe Orton\u2019s \u2018Entertaining Mr Sloane\u2019 at The Royal Exchange in Manchester.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985 Adam performed \u2018Vive Le Rock\u2019 at Live Aid and spent the next few years concentrating solely on acting in a string of films including Nomads, Junk and Slam Dance! as well as appearing in several US TV shows such as La Femme Nikita, Northern Exposure, The Equalizer and Sledge Hammer!  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1990\u2019s, Adam again, split his time between acting and music, returning to the studio to record and release the album            \u2018Manners and Physique\u2019 in 1990 which included the UK top 20 hit, \u2018Room at the Top\u2019. The follow up album, \u2018Persuasion\u2019 remains in limbo without an official release to this day, but in 1994 Adam recorded his next album, \u2018Wonderful\u2019 in London\u2019s famous Abbey Road studios. Released the following year, the album, along with \u2018Wonderful\u2019 the single and the follow up \u2018Gotta Be A Sin\u2019 were accompanied by successful tours of the UK and USA.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be twelve years before he would play live again, with an acoustic show, in 2007, at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London, where he read extracts from \u2018Stand and Deliver\u2019 his recently released autobiography.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, Adam was presented with the \u2018Q Music Icon Award\u2019 placing him alongside fellow recipients Paul McCartney and Bryan Ferry. This rekindled recognition resulted in a series of low key gigs in 2010 which enabled him to select a new band and to perform several sell-out shows in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, Adam performed at the Hard Rock Calling in London\u2019s Hyde Park and over the year continued playing live to over 250,000 people.  After 2 successful tours the USA, mainland Europe and Australia, Adam released his first album for 16 years: Adam Ant is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner\u2019s Daughter. \\r\\n\\r\\n2014 saw Adam return to his roots to perform the Dirk Wears White S\u00f8x album at a sellout show at Hammersmith Apollo, along with 2 live performances for Record Store Day in London that afternoon. This coincided with the release of a limited edition white vinyl of the Dirk album. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdam then closed the year with 4 more performances at Islington\u2019s Assembly Hall. \\r\\n\\r\\nDue to public demand Adam toured the Dirk album early in 2015 at a series of intimate concerts around the country to much critical acclaim with several of the venues selling out within minutes. \\r\\nA DVD of the 2014 Apollo show was made available and Adam finished off 2015 working on the re-mastered anniversary release of his iconic Kings of the Wild Frontier album, which was released prior to Adam embarking on the Kings of the Wild Frontier Live 2016 tour throughout the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the LP back in the charts, the sold out tour had Adam playing the classic and now iconic album, in sequence, to over 30,000 people, which culminated at Brixton Academy in London in a true riotous Ant gathering with fans coming together from all around the world to be part of the spectacle. \\r\\n\\r\\nOver the summer Adam took part in the Isle of Wight festival closely followed by 3 headlining slots at each of the Rewind festivals in Perth, Cheshire and Henley.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the phenomenal success of the Kings tour Adam returns to the Roundhouse venue in Camden for one additional sold out date, in his hometown, to finish off the year in a glorious celebration of style and jubilation.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":502},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":502},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":157},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":157},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":105},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":105},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-og.jpg\",\"width\":1200,\"height\":628},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":52},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":52},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":262},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":262},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":340},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/21-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":340}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-essential-adam-ant/id210053650?at=10ltdS&mt=1&app=music\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.adam-ant.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Adam-Ant/69349615331\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/adamaofficial\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"adamaofficial\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1773136,\"name\":\"Glam Skanks\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Hey rock n rollers we're comin to your town.
