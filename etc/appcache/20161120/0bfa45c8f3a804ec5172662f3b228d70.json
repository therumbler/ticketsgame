Psychic TV is particularly known for its intense and visceral live performances and for a creative lineage that includes cultural luminaries such as William S. Burroughs, Derek Jarman, and Timothy Leary, among others.\\nDestruction Unit\\u00a0(AZ)Only FL appearance\\\"In about five years, Destruction Unit, from Tempe, Ariz., has wormed its way toward its present status as one of the most hair-raising bands in North America. It plays tight, fast punk wrapped in deep layers of pulsating fuzz: The effect is something between a ritual and an attack. \\\"Negative Feedback Resistor\\\" delivers you a band in its own world, but the record is intensely charged, almost floating, saturated with wild action.\\\" -\\u00a0New York Times\\nTemple of Bon Matin\\u00a0(PA)Only FL appearanceImagine a jam session with Glenn Branca \\u0026 Hawkwind and it probably wouldn't sound too far off from the Philadelphia-based noise rock collective Temple of Bon Matin.

Cabrera\\u2019s live performances are as much a raw, uncensored vehicle of personal catharsis as they are a ritualistic forecast of what the future may hold for those who attend. With numerous cassette releases on labels such as Ascetic house and Acid Casualty Productions and tours with a wide range of artists, Horoscope has been a fixture in contemporary noise circles.\\nCollapsing Scenery\\u00a0(NY)Collapsing Scenery is the latest project from multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, and songwriter Don Devore, best known for his work with Sick Feeling, The Icarus Line, and Lilys. The band pairs experimental electronic music with noise rock and sound collage.\\nDrowning the Virgin Silence (FL)Drowning the Virgin Silence is a musical project of multi-instrumentalist Richard Vergez, who explores electro-acoustic and post-industrial music through the use of prepared tapes and manipulated sound.\\nOther Body (FL)\\nOther Body is a Miami three piece lurking in the most punishing fringes of noise, rock and experimental music.\\n\\\"Special Guests\\\"\\nVisuals by Tachyons+ and Secret Celluloid Society.\\nPay attention.Presented by Quiet Mind Recordings with generous support from the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, and Radio-Active Records.\\nDoors 8pm, 18+lookalivefest.com\",\"artists\":[{\"name\":\"Psychic TV\",\"mbid\":\"14c5a3a3-f5ed-4978-99af-486010e3a007\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5636124.jpeg\",\"thumb_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5636124.jpeg\",\"facebook_tour_dates_url\":\"http://www.bandsintown.com/PsychicTv/facebookapp?came_from=67\",\"facebook_page_url\":null,\"tracker_count\":10582,\"url\":\"PsychicTv\",\"website\":null}],\"venue\":{\"name\":\"Churchill's Pub\",\"place\":\"Churchill's Pub\",\"city\":\"Miami\",\"region\":\"FL\",\"country\":\"United States\",\"latitude\":25.826249,\"longitude\":-80.191757}}]\n",
