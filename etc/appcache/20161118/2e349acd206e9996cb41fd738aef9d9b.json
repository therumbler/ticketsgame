The band have now released their new album IT'LL END IN TEARS along with their new film THIS BAND IS SO GORGEOUS about the bands successful tour of China, which has been premiered around the world at various film festivals and continues to do so. \\r\\nThe band which was formed in 1975, to which its original founding member and guitarist Neil Harris still remains today. With hits such as BORSTAL BREAKOUT and HEY LITTLE RICH BOY being performed in 76-77, the band went on to have others such as HURRY UP HARRY, ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES and the anthem IF THE KIDS ARE UNITED.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band has had many line up changes but the most notable was Jimmy Pursey's departure following his sacking in 2006, in which he was immediately  replaced by the now vocalist Tim V.\\r\\nTim V's reign saw him take the band from its lowest point to get it touring worldwide with 3 successful selling albums along with World Tours and major festivals...and he has clocked up more shows than any other previous line up.\\r\\nThe band currently features along with Tim V, the bands longest serving drummer at 30 years behind the kit for SHAM 69.. Ian Whitewood.\\r\\nOn Lead Guitar we have Paul Brightman who has a pristine pedigree in Punk after serving many years with various touring bands. On the Bass guitar we now have Billy Wood from VICE LIKE GRIP. Billy has been pinned as the youth of the band, but struggles to keep with the Old Gits.\\r\\nLast but not least the band decided upon returning to SHAM 69's original format of 2 guitarist's and so on Rhythm Guitar we have Neil Harris who formed the band with Jimmy Pursey in 1975. Neil Harris was along with the other original members Albie Slider, Johnny Goodfornothing, Billy Bostik and Jimmy Pursey performing live with such hits as Borstal Breakout and Hey Little Rich Boy prior to the bands second line up change in late 1977. With over 12 line up changes since Punk pundits worldwide have sited this change to be the best yet with the sincerest force since the days of 77 Punk.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow with such anthem like songs as SING WHEN YOUR WINNING making the charts both here in the UK and Europe and other songs in the last 4 years such as LAST GANG IN LONDON being used in movies the band have achieved so much against the tide. The band who are praised for kicking arse onstage and at a ripe age are dumbfounding audiences world wide with their passion and total stage presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo this is SHAM 69 now and though many have scoffed at their existence they have come to regret it having been overwhelmed by the power of the performance.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":539},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":539},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":168},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":168},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":112},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":112},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":539},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":56},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":56},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":281},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":281},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":365},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/79/53-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":365}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://www.officialsham69.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/SHAM-69-Tim-V/478008948950506\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":668923,\"name\":\"The Creepshow\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Kenda - vox/guitar\\r\\nSickboy - bass/vox\\r\\nThe Reverend McGinty - keys/vox\\r\\nSandro - drums\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's true what they say. You can't keep a good band down. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the past 8 years The Creepshow have been smashing the whole world in the face with their brutaltastic m\u00e9lange of punk, country, psychobilly and good old fashioned rock n' roll. They've toured the world, sold a metric shit-ton of records and blown the faces off a ga-zillion fans\u2026But the road to punkrock infamy hasn't all been paved with rainbows, unicorns and gum drops. Over the years, the band has been fraught with innumerable hardships along the way. From robberies and wrecks to line-up changes and countless personal obstacles, this band has lived through it all. And you know what? Instead of crying in their beers and whining like assholes, they got more strongerer, more awesomer, more determinated and a whole hell of a lot angrier. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhich brings us to the title\u2026 \\\"Life After Death\\\" is the fourth full-length from Canada's reigning heavyweight champions of macabre, horror-soaked radness. Self-produced with the engineering magic of longtime friend Steve Rizun at Drive Studios (The Flatliners, Dillinger Four, Ill Scarlett, Protest The Hero etc), \\\"Life After Death\\\" is a sonic ear-gasm of debauched delights. Eleven venom-drenched bangers run the gamut of themes ranging from bloody revenge (duh) to unconventional love to the joys of cocktails to defiance in the face of insurmountable adversity and back again. This is the redefined, renewed, resurrected Creepshow at their very finest. \\r\\n\\r\\nPraise from the press gallery:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The album is nothing but good, rollicking, blood-soaked fun. Highly recommended.!\\\" \u2013 All Music\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Most importantly, however, it finds them branching into new lyrical territory, resulting in a formidable pastiche of twang, balladry, fire and maturity beyond the genre's restricting horror-influenced slap-and-shuffle confines. \\\" \u2013 Exclaim\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The Creepshow have pushed the boundaries, which has worked in their favour and will keep fans listening to their music for years to come- just maybe not when the lights are off.\\\" \u2013 The Examiner\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"At this pointing in the game The Creepshow can do no wrong. They might not have the most original premise, but their growing thematic awareness and tight melodies make for one hell of a psychobilly romp with little to no equal. A must have for creeps and punks alike.\\\" -PunkSite\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":745},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":233},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":155},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1590},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":78},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":388},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":505},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/82/00/11-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thecreepshow.org/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/thecreepshow/\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Creepshow/62979605646\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/TheCreepshow\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"TheCreepshow\"},{\"id\":1770058,\"name\":\"Gallows Bound\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Being raised in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains and stemming from three chord punk rock provides for a unique twist on traditional instruments.
