His travels around the globe as one of rap's most in-demand performers combined with his conversations with political activists and his genre-straddling work with Idle Warship and others caused Kweli to realize that he was limited in a sense, a prisoner of sorts of his own success as one of the world's best rappers with something significant to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My music has been associated with those types of causes, with positivity, spirituality, intelligence and being thought-provoking and such,\\\" he says. \\\"I think sometimes people get caught up in that part of me as an artist and don't necessarily understand the musicality or fully appreciate the music and the entertainment value behind what I do. I tried to stretch my wings a little bit and bring something that was less beholden to the world of hip-hop and more existing in the world in general.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of this artistic growth and exploration arrives with Kweli's dynamic Prisoner Of Conscious AKA P.O.C., an artistic tour de force that signals the start of the next chapter of Kweli's remarkable career. The BK MC spent more time working on Prisoner Of Conscious than any of his other albums, a three-year journey that found him exploring new vibes, joining in some unlikely collaborations and taking him to foreign lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Symbolyc One (Kanye West, Ghostface), the title track's alternatively rap and rock-based beat provides a distinctive platform for Kweli to deliver rhymes that detail his artistic awakening, while producers Sean C & LV (Jay-Z, Raekwon) created a Marvin Gaye-esque vibe for \\\"Come,\\\" a cut featuring Miguel that showcases Kweli trying to convince a series of women to do things his way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there's the dramatic, piano-driven \\\"Before He Walked,\\\" which showcases passionate vocals from singer Abby Dobson and includes a verse from possibly the most noteworthy guest on Prisoner Of Conscious: Nelly. Both Kweli and The St. Louis rapper recount the importance music has had in their lives on the stirring song, which was an outgrowth of conversations about music and life Kweli and Nelly had at Kweli's Los Angeles residence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Nelly is somebody I've known and have been friendly with throughout the years in this business,\\\" Kweli says. \\\"Nelly has always been an example for me because a rising tide raises all boats. Nelly is an artist who is polarizing at times because of the 'Tip Drill' video to the boycotts he's endured at colleges, but I know him as a person, and he's a great person.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere, the driving \\\"Ready Set Go\\\" with singer Melanie Fiona features Kweli's ever-impressive clever verbal gymnastics, which are also on display on the stark Busta Rhymes-guested and RZA-produced \\\"Rocketships.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKweli shifts gears on \\\"Favela Love.\\\" Inspired by and created during a trip to Sao Paulo, Brazil, the breezy song features crooning from Brazilian singer and actor Seu George (City Of God, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou). Kweli and George met in the studio, leading Kweli to deviate from his original concept for the song.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The song went from being about a woman to be being about Brazil, about the favela, about loving to come there,\\\" he reveals. \\\"The woman is really a metaphor for the place. That's why it's called 'Favela Love.' When I was telling Seu George about that, he started singing about how much he loves Brazil and where Brazil fits in the world.\\\"\\r\\nAfter nearly 20 years of releasing mesmerizing music, Talib Kweli stands as one of the world's most talented and most accomplished rappers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether working with Mos Def as one-half of Black Star, partnering with producer Hi-Tek for Reflection Eternal, releasing landmark solo material or collaborating with Kanye West or Madlib, Kweli commands attention by delivering top-tier lyricism, crafting captivating stories and showing the ability to rhyme over virtually any type of beat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn particular, Kweli showed his artistic reach in Idle Warship. Teaming with longtime collaborator and acclaimed singer Res, Kweli began getting out of his sonic and creative comfort zone on the group's 2009 mixtape Party Robot and its debut album, 2011's Habits Of The Heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nIdle Warship's music challenged Kweli and led him to a new artistic space. \\\"I like the position I'm in,\\\" he says. \\\"I feel like I'm a connector, a leader. I feel like I've led by example and I want to continue to do that. I like the fact that I'm in a position where cats who are coming out and making music that I enjoy are interested in my music and are interested in my influence. It's a great feeling.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKweli also has the high-powered Attack The Block mixtape with DJ Z-Trip set to arrive and will be focusing on making his Javotti Media (which released his 2011 album, Gutter Rainbows, and is named after his paternal grandmother) into a media powerhouse that releases music, films and books.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for now, Prisoner Of Conscious arrives as an artistic triumph, a collection that embodies Talib Kweli's robust creative vision. \\\"I wanted to put out an album that really can support the artist that I've become,\\\" he says. \\\"I'm a touring artist. I'm an artist that's internationally known. I'm not just a local artist at this point in my career. I'm cognizant of the fact that what I do is beyond where it started. I'm trying to reach the apex of where I am now, but without turning my back on or dismissing what I've done before.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":853,\"height\":1280},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-og.png\",\"width\":853,\"height\":1280},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atxl1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atxxl.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":975},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/67-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"RUMvqAtAFL4\",\"title\":\"Talib Kweli - I Try ft.

In their late teens the trio met Mary J. Blige who was so impressed with their tough street east coast lyrics, she gave them a big break by putting their demo in the hands of Sean \\\"Diddy\\\" Combs. Diddy immediately hired the trio to write for Bad Boy Records. With the label, The LOX quickly started collaborating on hits with Diddy, the Notorious BIG, Mary J Blige, and Mariah Carey which gave them instant notoriety and status within the hip-hop and mainstream charts.  In 1996 and 1997, the group wrote and performed on a number of Diddy hits, including \\\"It's All About the Benjamins\\\" and \\\"I Got the Power\\\", Mase's \\\"24 Hrs. to Live\\\", Mariah Carey's \\\"Honey,\\\" the Notorious B.I.G.'s \\\"Last Day\\\", and Mary J. Blige's \\\"Can't Get You Off My Mind\\\". In 1997 The LOX received international acclaim when their tribute to the late Biggie Smalls, \\\"We'll Always Love Big Poppa\\\", was picked as the B side track off of Diddy's album (3x Platinum) with the number one hit, \\\"I'll Be Missing You\\\". This single was the most played hit in 1997, which opened the door for The LOX first solo album debut in January 1998 entitled Money, Power & Respect (CertifiedGold). Though the album was a chart toping success, The LOX felt the glossy sheen of Bad Boy Records conflicted with their grimier rap aesthetic and therefore cut their ties and moved on to Ruff Ryder Records. After another LOX album, We Are The Streets (2002), Jadakiss was the first to release a solo in 2001 Kiss The Game Goodbye and Styles followed with his own in 2002 A Gangster & A Gentleman, which sold more than 700,000 copies. Styles continued his solo career with two more critically-acclaimed solo albums: Time is Money and Supa Gangsta (Extraordinary Gentlemen), furthering his reputation as one of the rap game's most talented lyricists. In 2011 Styles diversified his talents, signing a book deal with Random House and releasing his first novel Invincible. While maintaining a demanding tour schedule, he also released the soundtrack to the novel as well as Master of Ceremonies and saw the continued success of Juices for Life, his upscale juice bar in the Bronx. Styles, who has been juicing for the last decade, found that supplementing his diet with juicing brought balance to his fast-paced rapper lifestyle. This vision continues to fuel his success.  Styles continued recording and collaborating in the studio, releasing The World's Most Hardest MC Project in November 2012 and his newest album, Float, in April 2013. With a new LOX album in the works Styles P is sure to continuously add heat to one of the year's most anticipated urban releases. \\\"I'm proud to be operating as an independent where I have total control of my project\\\". Whether a part of the triple threat The LOX, or as a solo artist, Styles' razor sharp slick talk has created a cult-like following by his countless fans within the hip-hop and \\\"gangsta\\\" rap community.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":252},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":252},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":252},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":252},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-og.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":252},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":126},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":252},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":252},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":252},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/52-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":252}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://stylesp.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/stylesp\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/therealStylesP\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/therealstylesp\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"therealstylesp\"},{\"id\":1776215,\"name\":\"K'Valentine\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"On a cold snowy day at a downtown Chicago hospital, K'Valentine made her entrance into this world. She served as an early Christmas gift for her mother. The news of her birth also excited her father, Valentine Ogilvie Reid, who at the time, was incarcerated in another state. At an early age, in spite of many family hardships, K'Valentine excelled academically and in the Arts. Anything associated with creativity was and still is her forte.\\n\\nAs a little girl, K's exceptional artistic ability was so evident that it's no surprise that music became her life's passion. When she discovered the power of hip hop, it became her first love. She dove in head first and learned everything she could about the art form. Soon enough, she was impressing friends and family with her vast knowledge about the world of hip hop.\\n\\nK'Valentine began her lyrical journey by writing poetry to get out emotions she wanted to express. After a chance meeting with world renowned poet laureate Dr. Maya Angelou before she passed, K'Valentine was encouraged to practice until she mastered her craft. On the advice of Dr. Angelou, K wrote poetry non-stop, and those poems eventually transitioned into songs.\\n\\nAfter reciting poetry at numerous spoken word events and receiving positive feedback, it was time for K to finally get in the booth. Shortly after, she released her debut project, \\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\\" 2011. Breakfast at Tiffany's gave listeners their first look into K'Valentine's heart. She wrote about personal subjects but she also wasn't scared to get down and dirty on the microphone. On Valentine's Day 2013, K'Valentine dropped her second mixtape, K'Valentine's Day, which picked up where Breakfast at Tiffany's left off. \\n\\nIn 2014, K'Valentine linked up with Javotti Media, a label owned by hip hop star Talib Kweli, and began to work on her third mixtape, Million Dollar Baby. Million Dollar Baby finds K'Valentine rhyming over tracks that are new as well as her versions of existing hits, giving the listener a well rounded perspective of a young lady that can lyrically spar with the best of them. Million Dollar Baby puts on for the city of Chicago by featuring great Chicago artists like Bubble Eye, Vic Spencer and Mikkey Halsted, but it's undoubtedly K'Valentine's showcase. You can also find K'Valentine's contributions to the world of music on Javotti Media's mixtape, The Cathedral, which placed K in the company of esteemed artists such as Big K.R.I.T. Joell Ortiz, Curren$y, NIKO IS and more. \\n\\nK'Valentine's love for music has given her a calling, and she is here to answer that calling. The music she makes is not just wonderful for the listener, but has also been her therapy to get through life's trying times. As beautiful as she is talented, her experience is valuable and her voice is needed. Experience K'Valentine and enjoy!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://kvalentine.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Itskvalentine\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/thekvalentine\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"thekvalentine\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.wonderballroom.com/event/1387466?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
