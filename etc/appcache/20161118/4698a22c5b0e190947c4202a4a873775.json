Being influence by a large list of celebrity idols, his father who is also an artist and his best friend/cousin/brother whom we most likely know as Beejus, of \\\"FreeSpirit\\\" who is also also an artist as well, listening to other local music entertainers, Oops separates his style in various ways and creates different styles of music, showing off his versatility. Oops is different from your typical, traditional local rapper, he doesn't only rap and produce, he can sing (Melodically) he can write songs, he can draw portraits, he can graphic design and he can cut hair and all of it is just a hobby to him, he says he learned almost everything himself. He has multiple/unlimited amounts of talent. Oops started producing/making beats at the age 11, on a desktop computer, that was strictly used for homework and searching household information.\\n\\nOops was a troubled child as a kid, he was always on punishment, so to make punishment fun he downloaded something called FL Studio to just play around with and ended up liking what he was creating. Oops learned how to make beats on a Field trip that he snuck to after being suspended from school, where he met Goapele (A local R&B and Soul Singer) and her brother. While on the field trip, he was taught how to make beats the right way, after that day, nothing was the same, he then started making producing his main focus and stumbled across rapping but never took it serious, up until he turned 14 years old.\\n\\nOops grew up in the West side of Oakland but lived in the East s\\nside of Oakland, in the 90's, while growing up he started witnessing the drug dealing, the struggle and the hardship of the streets, so he decided to write about everything that he saw and been through and inserted it into his lyrics and poems. Instead of being your typical, rugged rapper, Oops decided to create positive music or as some would say, conscious music, rapping about ways to change his community, how to make situations better, telling his testimony/story or even the lifestyles of people like himself, similar to Talib Kwali, Mos Def, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Drake or King Los but, mixing his own style into it.\\n\\nOops is part of a group or movement called \\\"FreeSpirit\\\" a mindset that is taking over the music scene slowly, but surely. At the age 17, Oops and Beejus planned to debut Oops when he turned 21, publicly. That's why 21 plays a part of everything he does, from his social media names, to his passwords and even being his favorite number.\\nNow, Oops is working on many different projects including his own, producing and rapping. You will definitely be seeing and hearing more of this guy.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://oopsthemusic.bandcamp.com/releases\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/OopsTheMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/oopsthemusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"oopsthemusic\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1360389?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
