Schulz\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The inimmitable guitar riff, the wistful voice and Robin Schulz' driving, passionate groove put music fans under a spell in the summer of 2014. Regardless of whether you hear the track in the car, via Smartphone or at the club on the packed dancefloor: with his remix of Lilly Wood & The Prick's \\\"Prayer in C\\\" Robin Schulz has the world in his hands. To date, the song has achieved #1 in the iTunes charts in 27 countries and was Top 10 iTunes in 36 countries. In Germany he held the Number One position in the Single Charts, the iTunes Charts, the Amazon MP3 Charts, the Dance Charts, the Shazam Charts, the Streaming Charts, and the Spotify Charts, breaking all records. Furthermore Robin Schulz is the first German artist whose track achieved the #1 position in the Worldwide Shazam Charts. This success is exciting for the 27-year-old from the German town of Osnabruck, who has been a DJ and producer for 12 years. But he doesn't allow it to go to his head. The fans mainly see him behind the DJ booth, fully concentrated on the music, the distinctive lines of his face hidden behind sunglasses. Robin Schulz is surrounded by a somewhat mysterious aura. This makes it more fascinating to see how he directly and sensitively communicates with his fans through the music.\\n\\nElectronic beats have been a part of his life since he was a small kid. His father was active as a DJ in the Eighties. Robin experienced his early enthusiasm for music and let himself be infected. At 15 he experienced a party in a club for the first time. A DJ colleague of his father had put him on the guest list. And that's when it happened: the music sounded completely different here. It captivated the dancing, smiling and laughing crowd. But the DJ fascinated him most: he had everything under control and steered the crowd. Robin started saving up for his first turntables that he acquired when his was 17. Schulz then grew into the strong electronic music scene in Osnabruck, where ambitious promoters brought nationwide acts like Andhim or Pan-Pot into town. His favourite club is still Dr. Vogel which is run by friends of his.\\n\\nRobin was too modest to envision a career as a DJ and producer. But that didn't stop him from living out his passion behind the DJ booth of northern Germany clubs and in his own studio. In the beginning he was enthusiastic about melodic funky house with strong vocals. After a tech-house and minimal phase he turned to melodic, song-oriented productions. \\\"This sound is more musical in the end\\\", he says.\\n\\nRobin's music sounds light and effortless. But in fact a lot of experience stands behind his remixes and songs. Robin has been producing for many years, he had his first critical success with tracks on Beatport. The breakthrough came in the summer of 2013. With his platinum status \\\"Waves\\\" remix from Mr. Probz he transformed from a local hero to an internationally acclaimed deep house star as fast as lightning. And in 2014 came \\\"Prayer in C\\\". The story is a legend: Robin heard the song by Lilly Wood & The Prick on a YouTube channel. He was fascinated by Lilly Wood's unique voice and he was so enthusiastic that he immediately started to remix the song - without really thinking about it.\\n\\nThe next day he uploaded his version to Soundcloud - and couldn't believe his eyes. Deep House and Electro fans from all over the world couldn't stop clicking the track. Within one month the remix had reached more than one million clicks. The management of Lilly Wood & The Prick contacted Robin's booking agent. The band was delighted with what Robin had done with their song and the remix was officially released. The track then took its second triumphal step. The laid-back pop song became a festival hymn, an Internet phenomenon became an international hit that currently tops the Worldwide Shazam Charts.\\n\\nVery quickly Robin Schulz advanced to become one of the hottest DJ's in the German Electro scene. Now he has the opportunity to present his DJ sets to a bigger audience. He entrances the small crowds in clubs and the churning masses at festivals like Nature One or Tomorrowland. Although every set is different. As well as he prepares himself, Robin spontaneously decides whether to play deeper, more melodic or pop tracks. It is always the people, their faces and their excitement, their zest for partying that inspire Robin and drive him on. And of course they also stoke his fantasy in the studio. Robin begins to form his own unmistakable style.\\n\\nFirst Osnabruck, then the world: in the summer of 2014 Robin tours all across Europe and will appear in Ibiza, Amsterdam and even London. Parallel to this his time was concentrated on the production of his debut album that will be released on September 19 and includes remixes of tracks by such international stars as Coldplay, Lykke Li and Clean Bandit. Robin Schulz is a star - but with his feet on the ground. Even today he still lives in his old 47 square metre apartment in his home town. And although he appears at big venues on the road and huge audiences lay at his feet, he especially looks forward to playing in Osnabruck: because that's when his friends can join him.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.robin-schulz.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/robin.schulz.official\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/robin_schulz\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"robin_schulz\"},{\"id\":1769020,\"name\":\"Jonas Blue\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1758143,\"name\":\"Adam Auburn\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Firmly planted in the riches of house music history, but neatly poised to move forward into the future, Adam Auburn has dedicated his life to the music he loves. The buzz probably all began for Adam in 2004, after winning the first ever Traxsource DJ Competition, sparking a whirlwind of international attention for the East Coast native. In 2008, the ginger-bearded, house music advocate moved to Los Angeles, where he was blessed to be discovered by Insomniac, placed on display at their weekly events at Exchange, and ultimately the main stage at Nocturnal Wonderland, Escape from Wonderland, and EDC Week Las Vegas. Auburn's unique versatility as a DJ has allowed him to play alongside a wide range of Artists, including everyone from Kaskade to Diplo, Knife Party, TJR, Oliver Heldens, Duke Dumont, John Digweed, Maceo Plex, Maya Jane Coles, The Martinez Brothers, Hot Since 82, Claude Von Stroke, MK, Derrick Carter, Mark Farina, Louie Vega and so many more across 15 years of DJing. Auburn's deep love of house music can not only be found in the infectious energy that resonates from his DJ Performances, but also through the award winning house music events his production company, Auburn Events, has put on for over 10 years -- including Afternoon Delight (#2 Pool Party in the US - Thrillist 2015). In 2014, Adam began working as the Director of Marketing & Entertainment at Exchange LA, continuing to do whatever he can help push the music he loves forward into the future.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"http://soundcloud.com/adamauburn\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/djadamauburn\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/adamauburn\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"adamauburn\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1381483?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
