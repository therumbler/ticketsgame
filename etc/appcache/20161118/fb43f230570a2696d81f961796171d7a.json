Slik, The Rich Kids, Thin Lizzy, Visage,\\nUltravox and of course the most famous one off group in musical history Band Aid had by\\nthen all had the guiding hand of his musical navigation.\\nThen you have to take account of Midge's musical directorship of a series of rock\\nconcerts for The Prince's Trust, Wicked Women for Breakthrough and in honour of\\nNelson Mandela; a Lord Provost award for services to Scottish music; record production\\nfor Phil Lynott, Steve Harley and countless others; his video direction of memorable hits\\nby the Fun Boy Three, Bananarama and others, or a whole swathe of landmark singles\\nby Ultravox; TV, theatre and film music credits ranging from 'Max Headroom' to stage\\nand big screen.\\nHis musical roots were playing and learning the records of the Small Faces and other\\nrockers who did things very much their own way, Midge appeared to the wider public in a\\nmoment of heady teen success with Slik. Their sway-along Bell single 'Forever And Ever'\\ntook over at No.1 in the UK from Abba's 'Mamma Mia' on Valentine's Day 1976. Soon\\noutgrowing Slik's pop dimensions, Midge was snapped up by ex-Sex Pistol Glen Matlock\\nthe following year for his new outfit, the Rich Kids, who charted amid an avalanche of\\npress with a self-titled EMI single early in 1978. By April '79, with his name being added to\\nmany musicians' contact book, Ure had been asked by Billy Currie, Chris Cross and\\nWarren Cann to become the new frontman in Ultravox.\\nThe band was a major influence on the electro-pop movements of the early '80s and many\\nan open-minded studio and bedroom experimentalist since. Their successful trademark\\nwas combining Midge's powerful guitar riffs with sweeping synthesiser motifs, enigmatic\\nimagery and state-of-the-art visuals. Throughout the first half of the '80s, they brilliantly\\ncombined the responsibilities of top 10 artists and innovative style-makers.\\nAs interest in the 1980's rises again to a new peak in 2012, courtesy of reformations of the\\nlikes of Duran Duran and most recently Spandau Ballet, Ultravox's chart catalogue\\nrewards merits new scrutiny. Tracks like 'Reap the Wild Wind', 'Dancing With Tears in\\nMy Eyes', 'Love's Great Adventure' and 1981's timeless 'Vienna' were all massive hits\\nthe world over as they charted with awesome regularity, not only on single, but with seven\\nconsecutive top ten albums in just six years.\\nEven by then, the Midge Ure story had some individual chapters, of course. He wrote ,\\nproduced and co founded the studio collective Visage in 1980, then hit the top 10 in the\\nsummer of 1982 with his first release under his own name, an atmospheric take on the\\nTom Rush song made famous half a dozen years earlier by the Walker Brothers, 'No\\nRegrets'. Then came November 25, 1984, a historic day for Midge and all of pop music,\\nas 36 artists by the collective name Band Aid gathered at SARM Studios in west London\\nunder Ure's production. They recorded 'Do They Know It's Christmas?' a song he had\\njust written with Bob Geldof as the industry's heartfelt and eloquent contribution to\\nEthiopian famine relief. 600,000 copies sold in its first week in the UK alone was only the\\nbeginning: 800,000 more were bought in the second week, more than three million\\nworld-wide, and the unstoppable emotion engendered by the project led to Live Aid, the\\nsummer 1985 global concert that, all exaggeration aside, spoke for a generation.\\nWithin months, a staggering \u00a38 million had been raised for the starving in Africa, and\\nGeldof said that without Ure's initial enthusiasm for the idea, not to mention his rapidly\\npenned sketch for the single, neither Band Aid nor Live Aid could have happened. Midge is\\nstill to this day a Band Aid Trustee and an ambassador for Save the Children.\\nJust two months after Live Aid, Midge was back at No.1 in Britain, this time under his own\\nname, with 'If I Was', and by the autumn he had a No.2 solo album to accompany it,\\nentitled 'The Gift'. In 1993, that particular song was to lend itself to the retrospective\\nalbum 'If I Was'. After an initial solo outing to the Oxford Debating Society where his\\nresponse to \\\"What song would you write for Take That\\\" was met with the characteristically\\nwitty retort of \\\"An instrumental!\\\" broke the ice, he supported the album's release with a 22-\\ndate 'Out Alone' tour of Britain, armed only with a couple of guitars and a keyboard.\\nIn 1996 the new 'Breathe' album was followed by further extensive touring, including dates\\nin the US as special guest to the Chieftains. The Swatch campaign brought spectacular\\nrenewed international activity for the record in 1998. The album and eponymous single\\nwere subsequently in the top 20 throughout Europe for much of that year, and No.1 in\\nItaly, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, where Midge toured voraciously. 'Breathe' sold\\nover half a million copies in Europe alone.Respected German composer Eberhard\\nSchoener invited him to perform at the re-opening of the Potzdamer Platz in Berlin, in\\nfront of an estimated audience of 500,000.\\nSoon after Midge was busy producing and writing with and for various artists, both\\nestablished and unsigned, at his studio in Bath, and writing music for films. Other duties\\nincluded the 'Music for Montserrat' benefit at the Royal Albert Hall alongside Sir George\\nMartin, Sir Paul McCartney, Elton John and Eric Clapton, and a performance for the\\nlaunch of the Hard Rock Hotel in Bali.\\n1999 brought a major Japanese tour and shows for WOMAD in Singapore (where he\\nbroke the house attendance record) and Las Palmas, where the band played to a packed\\ntown square in a performance broadcast by Spanish TV later that year. Yet another new\\nstrand to his career emerged when Midge presented shows for BBC Radio on the\\ncareers of Roxy Music, Bryan Ferry and Thin Lizzy, also participating in a 15th\\nanniversary radio show to celebrate the Band Aid success.\\nWhilst completing work on his next studio album 'Move Me', Midge also narrated a tribute\\nto Alex Harvey for BBC Radio, appeared on BBC1's 'A Question of Pop' with Craig\\nDavid, and made various festival appearances, including a performance with Sir George\\nMartin for 'Wings & Strings', as well as completing another extensive European tour of\\nhis own to support the album release.\\nFollowing Midge's appearance on the flagship ITV program \\\"This is your Life\\\" in early\\n2001, EMI released 'THE VERY BEST OF MIDGE URE & ULTRAVOX' which prompted\\nhim to go back out on the road in \\\"rock band mode\\\" 'Rewind - The Greatest Hits Tour' a\\nmajor fifteen date UK jaunt supported the release and performed his hits from across the\\nfull spectrum of his career. The show was filmed at the Shepherd's Bush Empire, and\\nreleased on DVD through Eagle Rock. Once again, Midge was instrumental in the video\\nproduction, always preferring to keep things under his direct control. Another important\\nmilestone was the opening of the www.midgeure.com online shop; a vehicle which allows\\nhim to release his own product, completely under his own control. The first exclusive shop\\nrelease was \\\"Glorious Noise - Breathe Live\\\", followed by \\\"Intimate Moments\\\"; a\\ncollection of previously unreleased material. As he says, \\\"I needed a home for the songs\\nthat didn't fit a particular album. They're my Little Orphans!\\\"\\nAs we moved into 2002, once again he combined a series of acoustic shows with a\\nglorious summer spent performing a series of shows in historic building across the UK in\\nband format with \\\"The Pretenders\\\". Another exclusive release also hit the virtual shelves.\\n\\\"Intimate Moments\\\" is a candid record of his acoustic show, captured on a double CD.\\nAlways one to ring the changes, Midge next decided to revisit his \\\"electronic\\\" roots in the\\n\\\"Sampled, Looped and Trigger Happy\\\" tour. The 35 show tour left no corner of the UK\\nuntouched by this amalgam of old and new, the old being given a contemporary twist\\nsitting comfortably alongside the new. The shows were captured on the tour DVD, If I Was.\\nGerman label Hypertension picked up the release and issued it both on DVD and a\\nsoundtrack CD entitled Re*Live and his relationship with Hypertension continues to go\\nfrom strength to strength.\\n2005 was the year that Midge undertook both extensive acoustic tours of Europe and\\nthe UK as well as performing with the long standing \\\"Night of the Proms\\\" in Germany.\\nThis 21 date sell out tour of arenas saw a massive production with full orchestra.\\nHe then went on to be executive producer for the Band Aid 20 single working with the\\nlikes of Paul McCartney, Joss Stone, Radiohead and Chris Martin.\\nMidge's services to both music and charity were finally recognised in the Birthday\\nHonours list in 2005, when Midge was awarded a long overdue OBE!\\nHe also released his autobiography \\\"If I Was\\\" through Virgin books, and undertook a\\npromotional tour of bookshops where he did a short acoustic performance and a question\\nand answer session.\\nHe's also received honorary doctorates from both Edinburgh and Dundee Universities,\\nmainly in recognition for his work with Band Aid and Live 8, which took up a lot of 2006!\\nMidge actually managed to fit in a performance at the Edinburgh Live8 show in\\nMurrayfield in July where he played with Eddie Izzard helping out on piano! Surely a first!\\nIn November 2006 Midge and band performed a show with Level 42 and the Cutting\\nCrew for legendary German TV show \\\"Rockpalast\\\" which was received with great critical\\nacclaim! The show was broadcast in early January 2007. He has also performed with\\nGerman icon Xavier Naidoo at his recent O Livelait show.\\nIn September 2006 Midge travelled to Korea with old friends WOMAD and performed with\\nTroy Donockley and AD Chivers there. He also just narrated a documentary about the\\nCavern Club which was broadcast on BBC Radio 4.\\n\\\"Uncovered\\\" is his latest live incarnation - launched onto the UK theatre circuit in 2008....\\nCombining his own classic hits with a selection of songs that have been a major influence\\non him along with a smattering of personal reflections, all done in an acoustic format.\\nMidge has long held an ambition to record an LP of cover versions of songs that\\ninfluenced him...... the ambition was born when as a teenager in his first hit band Slik he\\nsaw The Walker Brothers performing No Regrets on Top Of The Pops in 1976....\\nHe managed to record his own version of No Regrets in 1982, but it was to take 25 years\\nand a change of format from LP to CD before he would record a full set of his favourite\\nsongs.\\nTEN was recorded in a log cabin in Eastern Canada during the long snow bound winter of\\n2007 - 2008 and was released again by German label Hypertension in September 2008.\\nThe CD contains 10 (surprise !) songs that influenced the teenage Ure when growing up in\\nGlasgow in the 1960's - 70's, so alongside the obvious (David Bowie) are the less obvious\\n- The Carpenters...Lulu !!! - All songs chosen for their unique qualities and lasting impact\\non Midge.... songs that somehow shaped his songwriting.\\nIn November 2008 Midge joined and participated in and acted as patron for the Burnsong\\nproject , which aims to encourage up and coming young songwriters in the \\\"black art\\\" of\\nwriting songs.\\nA spin off from this project was Midges' involvement with the Burns Humanitarian Awards\\nin Scotland in May 2009 - where the Burns Humanitarian Trust award was awarded to Guy\\nWilloughby of the Halo Trust which removes landmines worldwide.\\nApril 2009 saw the unthinkable happen - ULTRAVOX REFORMED !! Six months of talking\\nbetween Midge and other Ultravox band members Chris Cross, Billy Currie and Warren\\nCann led to a 3 week tour of the UK and Ireland....\\nThe last UK show at Londons historical Roundhouse was filmed for the HD DVD release\\n\\\"Return To Eden\\\"\\nSummer 2009 saw Midge combining further Ultravox festival appearances, solo acoustic\\nshows, outdoor festival appearances with his own 4 piece band, and appearances at the\\never popular \\\" Here & Now \\\" outdoor shows which play at stately homes across the UK\\nwith other 1980's guest vocalists.\\nNovember 2010 also saw Midge return to his role of MD for the Princes Trust at the Royal\\nAlbert Hall with a cast of the usual suspects including Eric Clapton and Phil Collins. He\\neven managed to fulfil a lifelong ambition and performed \\\"Seven seas of Rhye\\\" with\\nQueen.\\nThe second part of Ultravox's tour in 2010 took in Europe and Scandinavia, and following\\nthat plans were made to record an original new set of songs together for the first time in 26\\nyears... work started in September 2010 in Canada, and continued throughout the winter\\ninto Spring 2011. The subsequent album 'Brilliant' released on the Chrysalis label through\\nEMI on 28th May 2012 received huge critical praise from the media and even more from\\nthe fans who never thought such a thing could ever happen.\\nMidge, Chris Allan and Lee Curran have shot a documentary \\\"Brilliant beginnings\\\" which\\nfollows the band through Europe and the writing and recording of the album in Canada,\\nLos Angeles and London.\\nMidge is in the process of adding extra chapters to his autobiography \\\"If I Was\\\" and has\\nplans to release it in e-book format.\\nMidge continues to present show for BBC radio 4 including, Rockin Scots. Rocking the\\nBlitz Club. Motownship, the story of music and youth in the townships of Cape Town.\\nMysterious Mr Mercury the Freddie Mercury story.
