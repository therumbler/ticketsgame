With the ability to Sing and play a large variety of instruments it's obvious that music comes naturally to him. Since first sitting down at a keyboard at the age of six his dream has been to make music that he loves and perform it to people who love it just as much.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlux Pavilion AKA Joshua Steele has always been influenced by hard hitting dance music in everything that he does and it was only a matter of time before he found his own sound in the dance industry. in early 2008 Dubstep lit this internal fuse and he hasnt been the same man since.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfluenced by the likes of The Prodigy,Basement Jaxx and dubstep pioneer Rusko, Flux loved the high energy madness that dance music was capable of and set about making some of his own in the form of dubstep. Already adept with production skills he was soon off the starting block and his tunes were in swift circulation on the dubstep forum and were becoming a familiar name in the scene. What started of as a bit of experimentation soon became clear that Flux has definitely landed on his feet with the dubstep sound.\\r\\nBefore long labels were banging at his door itching to release his music so he decided that the world was ready for a bit of Flux Pavilion! Signing tunes to Rottun, Shift, XS Records, Stupid Fly and Dubmented beats and working with artists such as Datsik and Trolley Snatcha, his tunes were dominating the charts and starting to receive alot more interest from the big boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nNtype featured his track 'fucking noise' on his rinse mix cd and not content with that then signed flux's track 'Meathead' to his label wheel and deal. This was a massive look for flux and got his name out there to all the Dj's: Rusko, Hatcha, Plastician, Caspa, Skream. Soon enough no club was safe from one of Flux's bangers and the bookings came flying in all over the UK and Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile his career flourished Flux and childhood Friend Doctor P had also been working on some stuff together. They teamed up with Legendary DJ and drum and bass pioneer DJ Swan-e and Earl Falconer of UB40 and formed the infamous Circus Records. With his own platform for dubstep Flux began to imprint the scene with his sound and was quickly becoming one of the main players in dancefloor dubstep family. His track Voscillate Received 'Track of the Week' on Rusko's radio one takeover which even featured his own vocals and more to date his forthcoming single \\\"I can't Stop\\\" has just received world record of the week by Radio 1's Zane Lowe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell known for his high energy performances and smashing anthems Flux is now performing all over the globe, and further tours are confirmed for next year in  the U.S, Canada and Australia.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":836},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":261},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":174},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":836},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":87},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":435},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":566},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/14/95-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"3Q9rewnLFYw\",\"title\":\"Flux Pavilion - I Can't Stop\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Q9rewnLFYw\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/4800&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\\\"><\\/iframe>\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Q9rewnLFYw\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://fluxpavilion.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/fluxpavilion\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/fluxpavilion\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Fluxpavilion\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Fluxpavilion\"},{\"id\":1768648,\"name\":\"DOCTOR P\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"At 14 years of age most young people are starting to realize their potential.

Sharing his tracks with D&B radio stations led to the first recognition of his foot-thumping talents, and a first digital release 'Unleash' on Hammer Records followed in 2007, under the alias DJ Dose. He started working with Sensa and Jayline, with several more releases following, and James began to DJ to promote his own sounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009 James began to dabble with producing dubstep, giving his tunes a big energy by incorporating the drum and bass layering technique into his dubstep sound.

Packing a recipe of face-slapping snares, ground shaking bass and eye gougingly dirty synths \u2026 his sound resembles that of a demonic bass-saw that easily lacerates the ear drums of all it encounters.\\\"\\n\\nAs a child Tony spent hours on his brother's Playstation creating sounds on Music 2000. This inspired him to study music technology at college and it was here that he was introduced to Reason software, which he was, before long, to use to such devastating effect.\\n\\nAlways attracted to the dirtier sides of music, whatever the genre, he was caught off guard by Rusko's upbeat style on hearing 'FabricLive 37' and became instantly hooked. He began to make dubstep-style tunes, random beats with a grime sound.\\n\\nAfter rocking the place out with his first ever performance at a college end of year gig, the buzz he got was so amazing that he began to concentrate seriously on his music \u2013 and Cookie Monsta was born.\\n\\nHis barbaric basslines and grimy style quickly started to generate interest, and soon he had hooked up with Flux Pavilion. Intrigued by Tony's ability to create unique and mystifying noises, Flux invited him to join Circus Records, and Cookie Monsta officially entered the world of dubstep with his first release, 'Ginger Pubes / Blurgh!'.\\n\\nNext invited to remix Taio Cruz's pop tune 'Dirty Picture' ft Ke$ha, Cookie successfully switched the tune from pop to gritty by adding his trademark bassline. Further releases followed including 'Fat Girl Rodeo' on the Circus Records 'Beats and Pieces' EP, and a number of remixes such as 'Supafly' on Hard2Beat Records.\\n\\nCookie got the opportunity to showcase his talents on the decks for the first time ever in public on the Circus Records Takeover on GetDarker TV. And with 'Ginger Pubes' becoming an anthem for dance floors all over the world it wasn't long before Cookie was DJing around the world.\\n\\nAll Cookie Monsta wants is to have a good time, and he wants you to enjoy yourself too, so with world domination on his to-do list, watch for a visit to a town near you soon, join in, have a laugh and brock out.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":575,\"height\":331},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":575,\"height\":331},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":173},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":173},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":115},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":115},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-og.jpg\",\"width\":575,\"height\":331},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":58},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":58},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":288},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":288},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":575,\"height\":331},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/10-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":575,\"height\":331}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.twitter.com/#!/CookieMonstaDub\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Cookie-Monsta-Official-175957405757449\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/CookieMonstaDub\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"CookieMonstaDub\"},{\"id\":1221723,\"name\":\"Diskord\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"They've only been working together for 18 months, but already this duo's output has reached critical impact...
