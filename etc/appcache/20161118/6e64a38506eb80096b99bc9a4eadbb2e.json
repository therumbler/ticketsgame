Fowler\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\u201cWe\u2019re coming to a honky tonk near you, A little hardcore troubadour\\r\\nhillbilly blues Bringing country back, a little  old a little  new\\r\\n,We\u2019re coming to a honky tonk near you\u201d The title  song off of the new album by independent veteran  country artist  Kevin Fowler \\r\\npretty well sums up his sound, approach, and endless work ethic.  Steeped in the old school  charm of classic country music, amped up with a modern energy all his own, and steadily touring from one packed house of honky tonk dieh ards to another, Kevin Fowler makes  music on his own terms for the thousands and thousands of loyal fans he\u2019s earned down  through the years.\\r\\nTo see Kevin Fowler in concert is  more than just a show: it\u2019\\r\\ns an experience.  The Amarillo, Texas native\u2019s\\r\\nwild-eyed charisma breathes new life into old favorites like \u201cBeer Bait & Ammo\u201d and \u201cThe Lord Loves A Drinkin\u2019 Man,\u201d \\r\\nhis twangy vocals riding atop the honky tonk groove of his ace backing band.  Few performers in country music are as naturally gifted at leading the crowd in a good time, whether it\u2019s in a crowded dancehall or the wide open spaces of an outdoor festival.\\r\\nAnd few things amp up a busy musician\u2019s energy level quite \\r\\nlike  a brand new album to release: this autumn, Kevin Fowler will  be bringing the freshnew material of Coming To A Honky Tonk Near Youto his fans around the nation \u201cSometimes the recording process can be grueling, but this record was a pleasure to make,\u201d \\r\\nFowler beams when asked about the new project.\\r\\n\u201c\\r\\nI recorded it with my good buddy Trent Willmon. \\r\\nI think it  really shows in the final product when you are just having a great time making music with  your friends. \\\"It\u2019s a downhome feast of new tunes, kicked  off by the aforementioned theme song that lays out Fowler and his band\u2019s mission to bring real\\r\\n-deal country music to the people that love and appreciate it  the most.  According to the man himself, \\\"As I was trying to decide which songs to cut, these eight songs stood out to me and immediately  became my favorites. I think  our \\r\\nfans are going to love this record as much as I do. This is best thing I\u2019ve done since Loose, Loud and Crazyand I can\u2019t wait for everyone to hear it.\\\"Listeners may have \\r\\nalready caught the first single, \u201cSellout Song,\u201d or the accompanying video; a collaboration with fellow Texas songwriter Zane Williams, it\u2019s Fowler\u2019s catchy comical take on the modern trend of hip\\r\\n-hop beats and phrases finding their way into mainstream Top 40 \\r\\ncountry music.  Elsewhere he rattles off drunken advent\\r\\nures on one number (\u201cBouncer\u201d) then switches gears to the sincere, humble likes of \u201cLiving Proof\u201d or the affectionate ode to his home state on \u201cTexas Forever.\u201dSpeaking of Texas, it would be hard to understand Kevin Fowler\u2019s unique spot in the \\r\\nmodern musicaluniverse without a little  context of just what his home state has meant to his career.  The Lone Star State, for those who aren\u2019t already familiar, has a  healthy regional country music industry that\u2019s largely independent of the Nashville system. I\\r\\nt\u2019s a breeding ground for singers, songwriters, and musicians steeped in traditional country but empowered to write and play the kind of music that doesn\u2019t necessarily conform to modern \\r\\ntrends and expectations.  After an early stint  playing guitar in the popular \u201880s metal band Dangerous Toys \\r\\n\u2013did we mention that he\u2019s had an unconventional music career? \\r\\n\u2013Fowler steered hard back towards his country roots, forming his own band and playing the sort of songs his deep Texas twang was always best suited for anyway.\\r\\nThat detour wasn\u2019t an easy path :countless miles on the road, long nights on cramped stages in front of small crowds, and recording on a shoestring budget just to get his new original songs heard.  But \\r\\nyear after year it paid off.  Those crowds got bigger and bigger, those songs found their way onto regional playlists,  and those self\\r\\n-produced records started to sell well into the tens of \\r\\nthousands.  Within a few years there were enough Kevin Fowler fans out there to pack the biggest honky\\r\\n-tonks in Texas and beyond making him one of the state\u2019s most popular acts\u201c\\r\\nI think some bands have fans, but our fans are more like my road family,\u201d Fowler affectionately claims.\\r\\n\u201cThey have been coming to our shows and having fun with  us for \\r\\nover 16 years now.\u201dWith that kind of momentum, even the Nashville music industry couldn\u2019t help but notice and Fowler couldn\u2019t help but take the gamble on extending the reach of his music across \\r\\nthe country and beyond.  It paid off in many ways: he landed deals with  a couple of Nashville record labels, charted with a handful of singles (including the Top 40 hit \u201cPound Sign\u201d) and albums, recorded a duet with the legendary George Jones\\r\\n, toured Europe and worked with  other hitmakers like  Sammy Kershaw, Mark Chesnutt,and Montgomery Gentry.  Along the way he saw his home state popularity continue to soar and landed atop \\r\\nthe bill at some of Texas\u2019 biggest festivals.  By the time he stepped back into the independent scene with  his 2014 release \\r\\nHow Country Are Ya?, homegrown acts that \\r\\nFowler had influenced and collaborated with Granger Smith, Cody Johnson, and Josh Abbott among them \\r\\n\u2013were joining him at the top of the list of the region\u2019s most in demand artists. In the year 2016,Fowler can proudly say, \u201cThis is our eighth studio albumand I really think it s going to be a fan favorite.\u201d And Kevin Fowler still is what he always was: a \u201cPanhandle Poorboy\u201d from Amarillo who loved country music so much that one day he decided to make \\r\\nhis own, who has figured out how to do it  bigger and better over two decades of hard work, dedication, and always going that extra mile  to reach out to the fans that make it all \\r\\npossible.  Still \u201cLoose, Loud, & Crazy,\u201d still \u201c100% Texan,\u201d and always Coming to A Honky \ufeffTonk Near You.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":878,\"height\":682},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":233},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":155},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-og.png\",\"width\":878,\"height\":682},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":78},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":388},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atxl1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atxxl.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":505},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/80/99-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ltfLFwPUDw\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.kevinfowler.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/KevinFowlerMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/kevinfowler\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"kevinfowler\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1241321,\"name\":\"Honey County\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Founding member Dani Rose began her Country Music career after she moved to Los Angeles from Virginia and opened for LeAnn Rimes.  Her original singles were tapped for notable iTunes placements on the iTunes Country and Hot Pop charts and in 2014 she created the band Honey County, inviting A-list players and singers Leeann Skoda and Devon Jane to join her.  \\\"Leeann's voice and her harmonies are so gorgeous, and when I saw a video of Devon playing for Keith Urban at the ACM's it was a done deal\\\" says Dani, \\\"I think what really sets us apart, besides musical chemistry and our three part harmony blend, we all trust each other and have the same values\u201d.   Within six months of playing together, the girls voices caught ears across the country when they were picked as semi-finalists on VH1\u2019s \u201cMake A Band Famous\u201d.  In August 2014, their first single \u201cBlood From A Stone\u201d gained popularity with a feature on HBO\u2019s TRUE BLOOD, and began spinning on the fan-favorite Los Angeles indie radio station, KCRW with local airplay as well on iHeartMedia\u2019s 2014 CMA Award winning station, WPOC 93.1 in Baltimore, MD.  The trio went on to release a second single, '99 Bottles' which quickly caught the ear of SoCal's Country radio station, Go Country 105 and was selected as one of seven finalists in the 34th annual Country Showdown.  The girls recorded their self titled debut EP in Los Angeles, CA with award winning producer Ryan Williams (Kelly Clarkson, Train, P!nk, Adam Lambert) at Pulse Recording.
