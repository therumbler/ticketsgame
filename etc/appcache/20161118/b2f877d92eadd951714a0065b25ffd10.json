Garrett\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Raised on a steady diet of Jimi Hendrix, John Mayer, Alice In Chains and The Black Keys, Tacoma's Nolan Garrett is just as accomplished as a fiery axe-slinger as he is an ambitious songwriter. A mere moment's scan of his unique artistic amalgamation suggests an artist on the verge of something extraordinary as personified in his gutsy blend of timeless rock n' roll, sophisticated pop, elements of grunge and garage rock, doused with just the right of amount of blues on the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an artist of any age, it's surely an electrifying dichotomy, but considering Garrett is a mere 17-years-old, it suggests he's nothing short of a modern day prodigy. Yet even with youth on his side, the versatile performer is already a veteran of sorts who first started playing at age 8, took to the professional stage a year later and is currently criss-crossing the Northwest as a weekend warrior while he maintains a straight A average at the highly coveted Tacoma School of the Arts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I wasn't very good at sports, so I decided to try music and picked up the guitar, but when the day of my first lesson came around, I didn't even want to go,\\\" he lets out with a laugh of those pre-teen beginnings. \\\"But after my first lesson, I was hooked, and besides having a knack for it, I was able to get instant results where there wasn't any competition. I basically began playing all of the time, constantly striving to get better and improve, and wound up in front of 200 people within six months at a Relay For Life charity event.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from blowing away the crowd with his maturity, professionalism, and perhaps most importantly, playing chops well beyond his years, Garrett hit the open mic/jam night circuit with abandon. It was there that he met a slew of seasoned musicians at least twice his age, which led to further introductions of past and present greats spanning Stevie Ray Vaughan through Joe Bonamassa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"From the moment I started, I've loved the feeling of being on stage,\\\" he observes. \\\"It's such an adrenaline high and it's the one place you can start going crazy without anyone yelling at you. It's the place where you can really let loose, have fun and feed off the people cheering back at you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSmaller shows soon blossomed into prestigious area accomplishments, like sweeping \\\"Kids Got Talent 2010\\\" (where he scored \\\"Best Solo Artist,\\\" \\\"Best Band\\\" and \\\"Audience Favorite\\\"), bringing Seattle's lauded Paramount Theatre to its feet and winning 2012's local International Blues Competition, which ensures him a slot at the national contest in Memphis. Along the way he's also shared the stage with world renown Hendrix emulator Randy Hansen, Grammy Award winning zydeco great Chubby Carrier, plus fellow area favorites like House of Bourbon, and The Randy Oxford Band.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I usually have at least one gig every weekend, sometimes two, and I have band practice twice a week,\\\" he shares of his somewhat tenacious schedule considering he's still simultaneously a full time student. \\\"I love performing live and I try to make my songs and set list like a constant roller coaster: build it up, drop it down, build it back up and end on a climatic high that leaves people wanting a little more.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from that strategy paying off across the typical clubs, bars and theatres, Garrett's performance aptitude also made major waves at one somewhat unexpected location. During his trip to Los Angeles the weekend of 2012's Grammy Awards, the burgeoning troubadour set up shop poolside at the celebrity packed Sunset Marquis hotel, earning a full-fledged fan in the always eclectic Cyndi Lauper, who introduced him on the spot to producer friend Jeff Kossack (of San Fernando Valley's Other Hand Recording).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I didn't want to be super pushy or even play too loudly, so I just made a home at a little couch by the pool and played for pretty much eight hours straight,\\\" he remembers of the destiny-filled day. \\\"Cyndi and Jeff listened to my song 'Don't Criticize Me,' told me the song was definitely very cool, and in the case of Jeff, it opened the door to us working together in the studio.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAdds Kossack: \\\"Working with Nolan in the studio only confirms my original belief that he will be a guitar role model for his generation and his music will someday be heard worldwide, with all the accompanying recognition. He's a true artist, unaffected by vanity. His musical instincts and studio chops are amazing given his youth. I only look for big things from him in the future. 'People get ready...There's a train a-comin'.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides heading to L.A. quarterly to work with Kossack on songs for his forthcoming debut album, Garrett is also slated to include contributions from mixer/engineer/producer Marc Desisto (U2, Pink Floyd, Don Henley, Joe Cocker) and producer/mixer Darren Bowls (Red Hammer Records' Dreampilots). Thus far, the sessions have been both productive and liberating, never confining the switch hitter to a single genre and seamlessly blending his contemporary stylings within the framework of those seminal old school influences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I love the old stuff and it definitely needs to be brought back, but I want to put a modern twist and flair on my songs,\\\" adds Garrett. \\\"So far, my audience is really a combination of everybody. At my last show, I saw young kids in the crowd, a lot of people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, plus some older people as well. I definitely want to be a successful touring musician and dream of playing at big festivals in front of several thousand people. I watch a lot of concerts on YouTube and always think it's so cool when a band stops playing and you can hear everybody singing their song.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Garrett continues to shape his already incendiary sound, chances are that objective will creep closer to reality with each recording session and concert date that passes. But more important than simply CD or ticket sales, the newcomer has his feet firmly planted on the ground with an even more lofty goal in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"A lot of artists just yell into the mic and talk down to their audience, but my purpose as a musician is to connect with the audience,\\\" he sums up. \\\"When they come out to a show, I want them to get a feel for who I am as a person. I want them to see that I have a passion for music and that I'm a down to earth guy as well. I'm not a guy with a huge ego or someone who thinks they're better than everyone else just because they're a musician. I'm just like everybody else.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVery true as a person perhaps, but after playing a single note, this hopeful certainly stands in a class that's entirely his own.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":800,\"height\":534},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":800,\"height\":534},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-og.jpg\",\"width\":800,\"height\":534},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/28/14-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.nolangarrett.net\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/NolanGarrettMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/nolskigarrett\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"nolskigarrett\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":537309,\"name\":\"Down North\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Down North masterfully mixes underground rock and party-fueling soul, regularly lifting up audiences that have been craving new soul sounds from the city that gave the world Wheedle\u2019s Groove and Jimi Hendrix.\\r\\n \\r\\nDown North\u2019s upcoming new line-up debut will still feature the bold and sensual talents of lead vocalist/dancer Anthony \u201cRenaGade\u201d Briscoe, whose North Carolina-bred approach to making fans swoon has no equal in the Pacific NW. Raised on Michael Jackson and Sam Cooke, Anthony is as stylish and emotional as Prince in his vocal expressions. Co-leader Brandon Storms is an extremely versatile bassist-guitarist who writes much of the music and taps into his love for everything from Hendrix to James Jamerson in making tunes both infectious and substantial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recent additions of Drum Off! award-winning and crowd-amping player Conrad Real (drummer for Ayron Jones and The Way and Society\u2019s Child as well) and the psychedelic-jazz trills of guitarist Nick Quiller make the band an unusual and extremely welcome addition to the regional music scene. Depending on whim (and the size of the stage!), Down North expands to a seven piece, integrating horns and other players to help deliver their dazzling grooves.\\r\\n \\r\\nThey\u2019ll probably also transcend to higher level of acclaim very soon; early single \u201cDanger\u201d was played on MTV\u2019s The Real World even before this killer line-up was settled on. Newer meatier cuts like \u201cSo What,\u201d \u201cYour World,\u201d \u201cRunning,\u201d and \u201cHeartbreaker/Revolution\u201d (which features the Black Rock psyche-outs of guest legendary axeman Jabrille) reveal the band moving in even edgier, sweatier musical realms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe want to be an opening beacon for this scene that\u2019s happening now and not getting enough notice,\u201d Anthony says. He loves to hang out all over Seattle, but the other night was blown away when he met two gals on Cap Hill \u201cwho had lived all their lives here and never heard of Marmalade.\u201d He wants to open up the party to rock fans \u201cwho want to dance again!\u201d and to those who have been craving fresh, warm, loving soul in the midst of a chilly indie scene. \u201cThe people that play in this band are excellent at what they do and we\u2019re all here to play\\r\\nmusic for people who want to move and connect.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDown North is part of the zeitgeist not only of bands mining a deeper, better played history, but also one that taps into the 90s music scene when anything was possible. \u201cI grew up pretty sheltered,\u201d Brandon admits, growing up in a small Washington town near the Canadian border,  \u201cand had my life turned around by feasting on albums like \u2018Check Your Head\u2019 \u2014 the fusion of all those beautiful sounds going on\\r\\nat that time.\u201d Serious about his playing (like Anthony, they were raised in the church and really learned how to practice and perform music), he moved to Seattle, and enrolled in the Shoreline recording program. He joined some musicians which became the formative version Down North, and their first gig was opening for Alien Crime Syndicate before a crowd of 500 people. \u201cI was playing in a soul band before I even listened to soul!\u201d he says (and has truly grown into the role).\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many bands these days, the two met on Craigslist \u2014 Anthony finally finding collaborators who wanted to make the good time, high quality sounds he loves to listen to and make, and Brandon eager to add him to Down North\u2019s line up. \u201cI want to have a body of work,\u201d Brandon says about their recent playing in the studio, \u201cWe\u2019re going to focus on short releases (EPs) of great songs; I want to release as much as I can but it has to be high quality material.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2013Chris Estey\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_Jbo3v5qe70\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.downnorth.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/downnorthband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1769854,\"name\":\"Saint Claire\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":900,\"height\":1200},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":400},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":267},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-og.jpg\",\"width\":900,\"height\":1200},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":133},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":667},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":867},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/58/16-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://officialsaintclaire.bandcamp.com/releases\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.thecrocodile.com/event/1382255?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
