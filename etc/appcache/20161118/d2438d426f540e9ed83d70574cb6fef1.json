It's a vibey, ten-song album with an uncluttered production aesthetic that highlights Bronson's songwriting and his achingly beautiful vocals.\\r\\nThe story goes that after Bronson completed writing this cycle of songs, he sent Dave Cobb an unsolicited email with a sample track attached. Bronson was inspired to reach out to Cobb because he was intrigued by the spacious vocal production on the Jason Isbell record which Cobb had produced. Bronson felt Cobb could help him realize the atmospheric and timeless qualities he wanted for his songs. Cobb was impressed with Bronson's music and replied back. \\\"I was stunned when I got a response. It was really validating for me because I sort of had him on a pedestal,\\\" Bronson says candidly.\\r\\nEliot Bronson was recorded in one week at Cobb's home studio and Cowboy Jack Clement Studios in Nashville. \\\"It all felt really natural and effortless,\\\" Bronson recalls. \\\"Dave would be in the room playing right along with us during tracking.\\\" The album was mixed the following week.\\r\\nThe record is something of a homecoming for Bronson, who was raised in a Pentecostal home by a family for which music was prayer and life was expressed and enjoyed in song.  At an early age, Bronson discovered his parents' folk collection of 1960s artists. These two became formative musical influences shaping Bronson's purposeful, pensive, and poetic songwriting. Though his own music adventures took him away from these roots, he returns home to these music guideposts with Eliot Bronson\\r\\n\\\"I spent a long time trying to get away from where I came from,\\\" Bronson says, \\\"but it never really felt right. This is the music I've always had in me. This record is me.\\\"\\r\\nEliot Bronson is anchored by Bronson's honeyed weary voice; blend of wry wit with emotional sincerity; expansive palette of Americana; and the album's crisp vintage production. \\\"River Runs Dry\\\" boasts high-lonesome vocal harmonies, tenderly mournful lap steel, and it conjures up a cathartic sadness. \\\"I like songs to preserve little moments without telling a specific story, so you feel something but you don't always know exactly why,\\\" Bronson reveals. The rollicking \\\"Comin' For Ya North Georgia Blues\\\" combines almost William Boroughs-esque cutup images with unbridled and euphoric shitkicking musicality. \\\"I was really having fun with words and ideas on that one, trying to paint picture of a relationship\\\" he explains.\\r\\nBronson's engaging cleverness comes to the front on the \\\"You Wouldn't Want Me If You Had Me.\\\" \\\"I didn't think I was being funny on that one,\\\" he says with a good-natured laugh. \\\"I was being truthful, but I guess it works on a humorous level too. My friend said that title is the 'dating musician's credo.'\\\"\\r\\nPreviously Eliot Bronson issued two critically acclaimed solo albums and, prior to his solo career, was a member of folk favs The Brilliant Inventions. The Atlanta Music Guide says: \\\"Eliot Bronson is the type of songwriter who could squeeze out something meaningful about taking out the trash. He writes heartfelt songs with dark humor and backs them with his resonant voice and swampy instruments.\\\" Georgia Music Magazine notes: \\\"He can pull at your heartstrings like nobody's business.\\\" Coming up, in his native town of Baltimore, Maryland The Baltimore Sun called him a \\\"a folk singing wunderkind.\\\" He has won such esteemed songwriting awards as first place at Chris Austin Songwriting Contest at MerleFest and Eddie Owen Presents \\\"Songwriter Shootout,\\\" and he's been a finalist at Kerrville Folk Festival, Rocky Mountain Folks Fest Songwriting Contest, and New Song Contest Lincoln Center NYC.\\r\\nEliot Bronson was recorded in one week at Cobb's home studio and Cowboy Jack Clement Studios in Nashville. \\\"It all felt really natural and effortless,\\\" Bronson recalls. \\\"Dave would be in the room playing right along with us during tracking.\\\" The album was mixed the following week. \\\"It was quite a pleasure working with Eliot,\\\" says Cobb. \\\"He's a brilliant lyricist and poet. We did the record live all together and the album feels timeless.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":842,\"height\":842},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-og.jpg\",\"width\":842,\"height\":842},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/52/22/85-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.eliotbronson.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/eliotbronson/music\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/eliotbronsonmusic?v=app_178091127385\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/eliotbronson\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"eliotbronson\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1098105,\"name\":\"City Mouse\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"City Mouse's upcoming single release, \\\"Blood Red Youth\\\" defines what the Atlanta, Georgia, band's hometown fanbase already knew. This is a songwriting band. Since their culmination in 2013, the band's originality, forged around their own lyrics, persistence and enigmatic stage presence, has led them to sold out shows throughout Atlanta's various venues. They have shared stages with bands like The Steeldrivers, Cicada Rhythm, the Howlin' Brothers, Underhill Rose, Family & Friends, The Darnell Boys, and more.\\r\\nThe group became a staple of the Atlanta, Georgia, Americana scene as the trio featured on their debut EP, \u201cJoy of Life\u201d, but continues - with occasional help from a host of noteworthy Atlanta musician friends - as a \u2018duo-led collective\u2019. After some extensive touring, Michael Hudgins, co-founder and former guitarist, announced a need for a change of pace. The band's split came along amicably and, in fact, culminated in City Mouse partnering back up with Tony Terrebonne, Head Engineer of Atlanta's legendary studio, ZAC Recording Studios, and recording two final songs as the original lineup. The recordings, entitled \u201cThe Sanguine Sessions,\u201d includes Hudgins\u2019 poignant waltz about kicking bad habits with love as the catalyst, \u201cBloodshot Eyes\u201d, and a new song which will serve as the upcoming single from Revels' called \u201cBlood Red Youth\\\" - hence the 'colorful' project title. \\\"Blood Red Youth\\\" is a \\\"conversation\\\", according to Revels, between young lovers that is passionate and frenetic, \\\"full of the nervous energy that comes along with young love. As the song goes on, the dialogue becomes more intertwined and difficult to distinguish one voice from another; a parallel to both the figurative and physical aspects of being in/ making love.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Blood Red Youth\\\" and \\\"Bloodshot Eyes\\\" denote a marked solidarity of sound that shows the growth from the band's freshman release. City Mouse celebrated their shifting band and the new songs with an over sold-out crowd at the legendary listening room of Eddie\u2019s Attic in their hometown. This process was briefly documented by an interview the trio did with OpenEars Music in Atlanta, which you can watch here. \\\"The Sanguine Sessions\\\" recordings will be available everywhere the Summer 2016 following the release of \\\"Blood Red Youth\\\". The band is currently planning a Southeastern tour for early September 2016.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/01/23-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://citymousemusic.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/CityMouseMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/CityMouseMusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"CityMouseMusic\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1317979?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
