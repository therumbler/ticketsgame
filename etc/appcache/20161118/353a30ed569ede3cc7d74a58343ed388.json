Troutt\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Bay\u2010area born and bred, jazz and gospel trained, and internationally respected, Valerie Troutt is a musical collagist, borrowing from ancestral centuries of sound, channeling spirits, and delivering the stories of our love, loss, and lives. There\u2019s a light in this unapologetically unconventional artist/teacher/activist for whom art and activism are intertwined. Within this spiritual and social justice\u2010driven performer is a lifelong hunger for craft, for connection, for cultural narratives and an indefatigable thirst to serve as an agape griot to a waiting and hurting people. The Sound of Peace, her long\u2010awaited, full\u2010length debut comes after a critically acclaimed EP and several wizening years culminating in Valerie Troutt\u2019s acceptance of her own original artistic difference in a world of commercial carbon copies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe daughter and now aunt of an Oakland\u2010based family of artists, activists, teachers and spiritualists, both by blood and by community, the melding of Troutt\u2019s creative and spiritual life emerged early, at the age of seven with her first church solo. Children\u2019s choirs, holiday solos, and developing skills in piano and guitar as well as voice followed at the famed Walter Hawkin\u2019s Love Center. By adolescence, at Berkeley High, Troutt\u2019s world was being cracked open to the world of jazz at the same high school that produced jazz darlings Joshua Redman and Benny Green. Jazz camps, a Carmen McRae Scholarship, Stanford Jazz, Howard University Jazz program and ultimately the New School Jazz Performance program with contemporaries like Bilal Oliver and Tiombe Lockhart\u2014always surrounded by teachers and learners, both vertically and horizontally, in her musical blossoming. After the requisite hand\u2010to\u2010mouth NYC grinds, and a brief experience abroad as an ambassador for the International Association of Jazz Educators, Troutt ended up back in the Bay teaching music at the East Bay Center for the Performing Arts and performing for two years with the Grammy\u2010nominated Linda Tillery and the Cultural Heritage Choir, most recently as a featured soloist on Still We Rise, Still We Sing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile New York offered dream actualizing experiences like performing at SOBs and The Knitting Factory, sharing stages with major recording artists like Les Nubians, and honoring legends such as Bobby McFerrin at tributes, it was in California that Troutt found herself most in\u2010demand and coming into her own. Innumerable venues and festivals presented the unique Valerie Troutt experience including: Yoshi\u2019s Jazz Club, Laurel Street Fair, The Mint L.A., CODA Jazz Supper Club, and the Art \u2018n\u2019 Soul Festival, among others. Troutt further found herself collaborating with singer\u2010songwriters like Jennifer Johns, Maria Muldaur, Kimiko \ufffcJoy, and Sister Monica Parker, and recording with modern composers like Gregory Del Piero, Emanuel Ruffler, Howard Wiley and Jaz Sawyer. For nearly two years, she also served as a principle singer in La Pena \u2013 Ayer, Hoy y Pa\u2019Lante, an original suite of music by three\u2010time Grammy nominee, Wayne Wallace with libretto by Aya de Leon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the East Bay, Troutt established herself as more than an artist, but as a leader in the area\u2019s famed creative community. Partnering on Bay area projects with East Bay Performance art Center, the Museum of African Diaspora, Higher Ground Neighborhood Corp. and the Embodiment Project (where Troutt is Music Director). The latter project served as the genesis for MoonCandy live house music ensemble, a band Valerie Troutt composes for while still gigging with another band, trumpeter Marcus Cohen\u2019s fronted group, The Congress. Collectively, these varied and disparate influences informs her recordings as much as Bjork, Dianne Reeves, Carmen McRae, Joni Mitchell and Cassandra Wilson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keeper and expander of a rich cultural legacy in music and consciousness\u2010raising, Troutt\u2019s latest project, The Sound of Peace, borrows from the past and gives to the future. Half jazz standards innovatively reimagined for contemporary audiences and half truth\u2010telling originals penned by the lady herself, the Troutt produced project is an overture to her fans for not only social change, but also their own self\u2010acceptance. Recorded at Project West and engineered by Dion Decibol, the project was recorded with live musicians, including Darian Gray and Jazz Sawyer on drums, Raul Perales on electric bass, and David Ewell on upright bass and her partner in crime Maya Kronfeld on piano. Accordingly, this project has a live music feel absent Troutt\u2019s more electronic 2008 debut EP, Prepare for a Future. With live studio recording also comes more of the unexpected and unplanned dynamic moments that hallmark Troutt\u2019s signature sound. Whether Troutt is tackling an innovative arrangement of the classic \u201cI Didn\u2019t Know What Time It Was\u201d or sharing her own hybrid blend with \u201cRise,\u201d what is consistent is a jazz vocalist\u2019s skill with a soul stirrer\u2019s heart, making the genre\u2010labeling of Troutt\u2019s music unnecessary and impossible. Like that of her equally liberated contemporaries, Lizz Wright and Gregory Porter, this is just honest music.\\r\\n\\r\\nThematically, Troutt\u2019s two projects differ too, illustrating where she is now as a woman and artist in her musings and priorities. At the eve of Obama\u2019s election, Prepare for a Future spoke of intergenerational relationships, forgiveness, shifting in and out ouf the illusion and reality of love, vulnerability and emergency preparedness as a way of securing one\u2019s future. The Sound of Peace is about stepping out of cycles that fail to serve personal evolution and liberation, to embrace the self, and rise above self\u2010pity and self\u2010cruelty\u2014the rich themes of a philosophically reflective artist. The common thread weaving these two sides of Troutt is an understanding of music as survival, as a spiritual and wellness tool for growth, both personal and communal. It is after all, what time and again saved her own life and gave her the faith and strength to believe in herself and persevere in an industry disdainful of difference, and everything about Valerie Troutt is wholly, unapologetically, and powerfully different. With The Sound of Peace, Valerie Troutt hopes listeners welcome their own difference, freeing it into the world as a light all their own.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atjmbo.JPG\",\"width\":960,\"height\":846},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atjmbo1.JPG\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atlg.JPG\",\"width\":300,\"height\":264},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atlg1.JPG\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atmd.JPG\",\"width\":200,\"height\":176},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atmd1.JPG\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-og.JPG\",\"width\":1905,\"height\":1678},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atsm.JPG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":88},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atsm1.JPG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-sq.JPG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-sqsm.JPG\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atxl.JPG\",\"width\":500,\"height\":440},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atxl1.JPG\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atxxl.JPG\",\"width\":650,\"height\":573},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/16-atxxl1.JPG\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"360\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPcUZ9kplXE\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.valerietrouttmusic.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"https://myspace.com/valerietroutt\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/MoonCandyLiveHouseEnsembleProject/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ValerieTroutt1\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ValerieTroutt1\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.yoshis.com/event/1209819?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
