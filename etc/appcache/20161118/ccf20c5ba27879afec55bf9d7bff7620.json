If  that  were the  only  unusual  thing  about  the  making  of  'Lo-Fantasy,'  his  fifth  studio  album,  it would still be remarkably strange, but this is no ordinary Sam Roberts Band record. One year earlier: New  songs  were  taking  shape  in  the dim  glow  of  Sam's Montreal basement studio.  \\\"It might  have  taken  less  time  if  my  kids  had  respected  my  privacy  a  little  more,\\\"  says Roberts. \\\"Once I put a lock on the door, things started to move faster.\\\" The songs were calling  on  a  broad  spectrum  of  influences,  from  the  Clash  to  Fela  Kuti,  from electronic-gurus  Underworld  to  Etienne  De  Crecy,  from  Gordon  Lightfoot  to  Ray Davies. What the music needed was a producer and a visionary who could help sculpt these  different  directions  into  a  focused,  living  whole.  The  band  took  a  shot  in  the dark and sent rough demos across the pond... Who they got was Youth. Youth  (a.k.a.  Martin  Glover)  boasted  an  incredible  resume,  with  production  credits ranging from The Verve's 'Urban Hymns' to Crowded House, as well as stints performing with Paul McCartney, ambient-techno kings The Orb, and post-punk outfit Killing Joke. \\\"His  musical  background  hit  every  note,  all  the colours  we  were  trying  to put on  the record,\\\"  says  Roberts.  They  met  in  Montreal  for  a  freezing  February  week  of  pre-production,  Youth  swearing  it  had  to be  \\\"Hell  on  Earth!\\\"  He pored  over Roberts'  new tracks  with  an  irreverent  and  unrelenting  eye.  \\\"He'd  say,  'Where's  the  chorus,  man?'\\\" Roberts laughs in his best British accent. \\\"'That's not a chorus. THIS is the chorus.' He was  unapologetically  ripping  the songs  to  pieces,  putting  songwriter  and  band  to  the test.  I  had  to  defend  my  music,  know  when  to  dig  in  my  heels,  knowwhen  to  try  a different  approach.  You  have  to  be  elastic  enough  that  you're  open  to  the  new possibilities, and our bond grew stronger through that.\\\" At  the  end  of  the  week,  Youth  returned  to  England,  leaving  Roberts  and his  band\u2014guitarist  Dave  Nugent,  bassist  James  Hall,  keyboardist Eric  Fares,  and  drummer  Josh Trager\u2014to  make  sense  of  it  all.  Songs  were  shuffled,  jettisoned,  and  reassembled, verses became choruses and choruses became verses. While Sam and the band might normally spend twelve months recording an album, Youth returned to Montreal in May and  informed  them  that  they'd  be  recording  'Lo-Fantasy'  live-off  the  studio  floor  in twelve days. \\\"The weather,\\\" he said, \\\"was much better...\\\" \\\"We  worked  insanely  long  hours  -  after  three  days  of  that  you're  almost  in  a hallucinogenic  state,  like  an  ayahuasca  journey  -  or  so  I've  heard,\\\"  Roberts  laughs. \\\"Youth would be in the control room with his Hawaiian shirt unbuttoned, dancing and doing  oil  painting  interpretations  of  the  songs  while  we  were  recording,  and we're thinking, 'My God we've got a madman at the helm!'\\\" The combination of sleep deprivation, excitement, uncertainty, and adrenaline pushedthe band outside any notion of comfort, generating their most dynamic and inventive arrangements  to  date.  It  also  helped  capture  the  fiery  spirit  and  urgency  that  have made  their live  shows  so legendary,  earning  them  spots  performing  everywhere  from Letterman and Conan to Bonnaroo, ACL, Lollapalooza and Bumbershoot, and alongside \\r\\nheroes  like  the  Rolling  Stones  and  AC/DC.  \\\"Youth  would  be  very  encouraging  and constructive, and then sometimes he'd be ruthless,\\\" Sam explains.  \\\"You'd be sweating over a guitar part or a vocal take and you'd hear Youth say, 'Lame!' in the headphones. Devastatingly  direct...  It  became  this  real  psychological  trip.  He's  there  to  create  an atmosphere in which a record is going to be made, to shake you right out of your boots as a musician and hold your feet to the fire. And after  a while you adapt to being in that  frame  of  mind  where  you  have  to  think  on  your  feet  and  be  ready  to try everything completely differently.  If you got Youth up on his feet dancing, you knew you were on the right track.\\\" It's   only   fitting,   then,   that   'Lo-Fantasy'   opens   with   the   slithery   groove   of \\\"Shapeshifters,\\\"  an  ode  to  fluid  identity  and  flexible  self-image.  \\\"That  song  is  a gateway to a lot of what happens on the rest of the record,\\\" Roberts says. \\\"It was one of the first I wrote for  the album,  an all-out dance track,  and I felt that with a song like this under my belt, I wasn't going to be pigeonholed into making any one specific kind of record.\\\" From  the  anthemic  call  for  solidarity  of  \\\"We're  All  In  This  Together\\\"  to  the  electro-thump  of  \\\"Chasing  The  Light,\\\"  'Lo-Fantasy'  is  indeed  the  most  wide-ranging  collection Roberts has ever written,  infusing his particularly rousing brand of rock and roll with elements  of  funk,  house,  electronic,  and  African  music.  Throughout  it  all,  his lyrics grapple  with  greater  questions  of  identity  and  self-discovery  in  the  modern  age. \\\"That's  the  test  of  a  rock  and  roll  song  or  a  pop  song  to  me,\\\" Roberts  says.  \\\"It's  to confront those issues in three or four minutes, to get to a place where the music itself helps bring you towards some enlightenment, or at least some resolution to those big questions.\\\" Once  tracking  was  completed,  Roberts  and  Nugent  headed  to  Spain  for  the final touches  at El  Mirador  Studio,  a beautiful  mountaintop  retreat  Youth  had constructed overlooking  olive  orchards  and  modeled  after  sketches  of  hobbits'  homes  in  Middle Earth from the 'Lord Of The Rings.' It was there, in his own personal hobbit hole, that Roberts  completed  work  on  the  album's  final  songs,  a  fittingly  strange end  to  a particularly surreal and mystical recording process. A remix studio was set up just outside the control room, where Youth and Eddie Banda would take the newly-minted tracks and twist them into electronic incarnations ready for  the  dance-floors  of  the  world.  \\\"We  were  going  through  a  heavy  'Tears for  Fears' phase on our last tour,\\\" Roberts explains, so for the final phase of the record, mixing duties were given to Dave Bascombe, renowned UK mixer and engineer on 'Songs From The Big Chair.' \\\"Low fantasy is a literary genre that takes place in a world very much like our own, but in  which  magic  -  or  the  possibility  of  magic  -  exists,\\\"  Roberts  says.  \\\"It's  grounded  in reality,  but  it's  an  altered  reality.  You  can  still ride  a  train  to  Alberta,  but  there's  a place  for  the  supernatural  in  this  otherwise  rational  world  -  it's  out  there  and  we haven't tapped into it yet.\\\" Maybe music is the bridge....\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1440},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-og.jpg\",\"width\":1365,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":975},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/75/33-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.samrobertsband.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/samrobertsband\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/OfficialSamRobertsBand\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/samrobertsband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"samrobertsband\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1713495,\"name\":\"Hollerado\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Originally hailing from Ottawa, Hollerado burst onto the world stage in 2010 with their debut Record In A Bag. The LP introduced music fans to Hollerado's irresistible guitar-pop and earned them a 2011 JUNO nomination for \\\"Best New Artist\\\". Their savvy DIY approach, along with their incredible talent and tenacity, saw the band gain international attention in short order. Hollerado's penchant for making super creative and share-worthy music videos like uber-viral Americanarama, which with over 1 Million YouTube views, helped solidify the bands' popularity. Tours in China and Brazil, and shows with Flaming Lips, Weezer and Jack White's The Dead Weather soon followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2013, Hollerado released their highly anticipated sophomore album White Paint. The 11 tracks stand out as a reflection of the sheer volume of life experience and the hundreds of shows members Menno Versteeg, Dean Baxter and brothers Nixon and Jake Boyd have played since forming in 2007. The lead single \\\"Pick Me Up\\\" hit #3 at Modern Rock and was the #1 most added track at Alternative after only three weeks at radio. \\\"So It Goes\\\" just hit Canadian radio last week and is already Top 20 on the Alternative radio chart and Top 20 on the BDS Modern Rock chart.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn keeping with their boundless creativity and DIY approach the band invited friends to a warehouse party in a suburb of Toronto where they hand painted every single physical copy of the record with a signature stroke of white paint. The LP earned the band further critical acclaim and a chance to cross Canada in support of Canadian rock legends Billy Talent earlier this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 31, 2013, Hollerado released a video for the single \\\"So It Goes\\\" from their most recent LP White Paint on the band's own label, Royal Mountain Records. Directed by award-winning video director Marc Ricciardelli (Alexisonfire, City and Colour, Hedley) the documentary-esque video captures an incredible \\\"reunion\\\" and story of forgiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song is written about lead singer Menno Versteeg's Dutch grandfather and the incredible story of how his life was spared by a Nazi officer during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in WWII. After the war, Menno's \\\"Opa\\\" who was part of the Dutch Resistance, testified on behalf of the former SS soldier during a tribunal and recounted how the man had compassionately spared his life. In doing so, Menno's grandfather help spare the German's life in return. With the help of the Dutch government, the band was actually able to track down the German's grandson, and Menno and the grandson - who are alive today because of both of their grandfathers' compassion and courage - have an emotional meeting in Munich while Hollerado was in Rotterdamn shooting the music video. The best part is the incredible meet-up, documented in a special long version of the video. The video premiered on Huffington Post (USA/CAN), instantly became front-page news and the story has spread to national TV news, talk shows and appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Crazy-catchy melodies, raging hooks and riffs seal the deal\\\" \u2014 SPIN\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/17-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.hollerado.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/hollerado\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/hollerado\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"hollerado\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.boweryballroom.com/event/1281949?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
