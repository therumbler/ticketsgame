Frankenreiter\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Donavon Frankenreiter's new album, \\\"The Heart,\\\" officially marks the start of the singer-songwriter's second decade as a solo recording artist. It's been over ten years since the release of his self-titled debut, and in that time he has grown, not only as a musician, but also as a man. He's raising a family and nurturing two creative careers-one onstage, one in the waves-but on top of all that, he's still learning what makes him tick. And so, naturally, he named his album after his ticker. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All these songs are as close to me singing from the heart as I can,\\\" says Frankenreiter. \\\"It's a complete record; the songs are intertwined. I had to call it 'The Heart,' that was the theme of the record.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe songs here are seriously sentimental, without question the heaviest material he has released to date. Part of that inspiration came from his co-writer, the prolific songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips, with whom Frankenreiter had collaborated in the past on his album \\\"Pass It Around.\\\" He recognized the ease with which the two worked together and sent Phillips a handful of new tunes and ideas. He was astonished at the brilliance of the songs that came back, and so quickly, but also by one of Phillips' suggestions in particular. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Grant told me, 'You should make the most intimate and honest record you've ever made,'\\\" says Frankenreiter. \\\"So these songs are simple and intimate and honest, they aren't cheeky. There's some ups and downs-I love writing positive songs and happy tunes, but there are some downers here. I feel like it's where I'm at, 42 years old. Every one of these songs means a lot to me. They're from the heart.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nTo record them, Frankenreiter booked two weeks of studio time in May of 2015 at Blue Rock Studios in Wimberley, Texas. But unlike the privacy afforded by most studios, these sessions were to be live-streamed on the Internet in a soul-baring exhibition for his fans-talk about intimate and honest. With just two bandmates and a studio engineer, Frankenreiter knocked out a song each day and recorded the entire album in full view of a watching public. He had never been so inspired, and embraced every aspect of the situation: the landscape, the lodging, the isolation, the overall challenge. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We went in saying, 'Let's make the best record we can that we enjoy,'\\\" he says. \\\"And not that I didn't feel that way about my other albums, but this was the one that felt the most natural. Even the way we made it, too, a song a day. I went into it feeling a little pressure, this whole live-streaming thing; if we hit a rut the first day, we're screwed. But the first day we cut 'Big Wave,' and it was off to the races.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe nature of the recording environment removed any \\\"fuck-around\\\" time and replaced it with the utmost efficiency and excitement. As Frankenreiter says, it was an experiment, and it invigorated the band, resulting in their most cohesive process to date. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"There's something magical about Blue Rock Studios and Wimberley, Texas,\\\" he says. \\\"It's really powerful, that's one spot that is really bitching. This place is beautiful, a huge estate on 50 acres, cows walking by the windows while you're recording-this open, amazing wilderness. We lived in the studio, and to record there and never have to leave, that's the first time I ever made a record that way. Every morning you wake up and hit it again. I was in such a bubble; it was all about the music. I think about it now and it's emotional.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the process, he continued to have more encounters of the heart-some more literal than others. While recording \\\"Woman,\\\" it was noticed that a Tibetan singing bowl found in the studio was in the same key as the Heart Chakra, one of the centers of spiritual energy in the body, and both just so happened to be in the same key as the song. Someone played it, and the sound made the final cut on the album. \\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere, the song \\\"Little Shack\\\" was culled from someone who shares Frankenreiter's heartbeat: his 12-year-old son, Hendrix. \\\"One night, at home in Hawaii, I was trying to write songs and my son was jamming on his electric,\\\" he says. \\\"I was like, 'What is that song?' and he said, 'It's just something I've been working on.' He taught it to me, and I recorded it that night and sent it to Grant. Twenty-four hours later, Grant sent back the words. It kinda has that vibe of two people getting together: it doesn't matter where you are in the world, I got everything I need right in front of me. It sounded like I wrote it, and Hendrix wrote the music. That was the first time that's ever happened.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nOther moments on the album, like \\\"Sleeping Good Night,\\\" \\\"The Way ?ou Catch the Light,\\\" \\\"When the River Bends\\\" (co-written by Graham Colton and Phillips), and the aforementioned \\\"Big Wave,\\\" highlight emotions but also have about them an ease, a familiarity, a confidence that only comes from experience. These are songs that Frankenreiter could not have pulled off in his first decade. There is a rollicking comfort to them, but also those serious sentiments of love and loss, faith and joy and, more than anything, self-examination and freedom. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I feel really lucky that I got into the game when I did,\\\" he says. \\\"I'm still lucky I'm able to make records and that we have a fan base and are able to tour. I started my own record label; it's a way for me to make my own music the way I want to, on my own time, and to put it out my way. So many things have changed and I feel a little wiser than ten years ago. I learned a lot over the last decade, it went by really quick. It's fun to have a new album done and to hit the road with a bunch of new songs, it rejuvenates you to do your thing.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, for now, Frankenreiter's \\\"thing\\\" may be compassion. Perhaps most heavy on \\\"The Heart\\\" is its final song, \\\"California Lights,\\\" a tune written about Frankenreiter's father's battle with Leukemia. \\\"It was written about my dad, who was dying during the making of this record. He died about two weeks after we finished it. It was pretty intense, a heavy song to record. I did that song in its completion three times, that's \\r\\n\\r\\nall I could only make it through. The live take of me playing the guitar and singing was the only way I could do it. I was seeing the heart everywhere.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nIn those moments of emotional heaviness, Frankenreiter reaches for his guitar to guide him, for an escape. \\\"I felt like I was completely in a bubble the whole time I recorded, I was so inside the music. I cried when I left the studio, and the guys in the band did, too; it was radical. It was like going back to reality. That's what music does, you can definitely escape.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nA decade into his career, Donavon Frankenreiter has learned to listen to his ticker above all else. Doing so has allowed the light to come in from all the corners of his world, even those where there is darkness. Sharing the load with those he trusts, and especially with those he loves, he has seized the opportunity to take control of his craft, on his own terms, and to follow his own beat. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I went into this album saying I wanted to make songs I love,\\\" he says. \\\"Whatever feels right, go ahead and record it, and worry about what happens after, afterwards. I'm proud of it. I go back to the title of the album, and in the song 'You and Me,' that chorus: 'It's gotta be from the heart/for it to start'... There's so many things going on out there, everybody's moving to the beat of a different drum, but I feel like all good things start from the heart.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/31/88-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"vYeLDs7Wh_k\",\"title\":\"Donavon Frankenreiter - \\\"Big Wave\\\" - Music Video (OFFICIAL)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYeLDs7Wh_k\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYeLDs7Wh_k\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.donavonf.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/donavonfrankenreiter\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/donavonfrankenreiter\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/dfrankenreiter\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"dfrankenreiter\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1772611,\"name\":\"Grant-Lee Phillips\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Iconic troubadour Grant-Lee Phillips has been a pioneering force for more than twenty five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nPushing the limits of folk, alternative, pop and Americana, Phillips\u2019 band Grant Lee Buffalo was a seminal \u201890s mainstay. The twenty-first century saw his transition into a prolific solo career. Says Phillips, \u201cHistory and legend have often found their way into my songs.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nOn his 2012 release \u201cWalking in the Green Corn\u201d he drew from his Native American heritage. A year later Phillips relocated from Los Angeles to Nashville, marking a new creative chapter, inspiring his freshly minted new album project, \u201cThe Narrows.\u201d Rolling Stone named the album as one the 35 most anticipated Country albums of 2016.  While \u201cThe Narrows\u201d may buck ideas of what Country is and can be, it\u2019s founded on a genuine embrace of America\u2019s musical roots and branches, hinging on Phillips\u2019 proclivity for detailed lyrical story telling and rich musical atmospheres. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s a signature that marks the albums of Grant Lee Buffalo, going as far back as \u201cFuzzy\u201d ( 1993 ) which Michael Stipe of R.E.M. endorsed as \u201cThe best album of the year.\u201d Grant Lee Buffalo albums like \u201cMighty Joe Moon\u201d remain enigmatic treasures, that new generations are drawn to. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs with most artists, Grant-Lee Phillips\u2019 eyes are fixed on the work at hand and that of tomorrow. With four Grant Lee Buffalo studio albums and eight to his own name there\u2019s precious little time to enjoy the fruits of his labor. His tour schedule finds him circling the globe many times over in a given year. Occasionally he turns up in the most unlikely places, such as portraying the Town Troubadour on TV\u2019s The Gilmore Girls. Constant movement, physically and creatively is almost a mantra.
