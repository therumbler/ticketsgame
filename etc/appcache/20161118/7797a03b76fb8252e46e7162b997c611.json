it comes to eclecticism, no other electronic musician can replicate the sheer ingenuity that American producer David Pezzner invokes within his mosaic compositions. Hailing from Seattle\u2019s enlightened indie-music scene, the multifarious studio mogul has steadily supplied a series of notable releases since the early 90s. After initially fulfilling career ventures as one half of classic house outfit Jacob London, his sights have recently shifted towards a more independent musical outlet: his prolific solo project, Pezzner. Unhindered by the industry\u2019s often-scrupulous guidelines, David\u2019s artistic reinvention (under his newest production moniker) has amassed considerable acclaim in light of its obstinate diversity \u2013 exploring a kaleidoscopic assortment of styles and sounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in November, Pezzner proudly premiered his sophomore full-length artist album, \u2018Last Night In Utopia\u2019. Fittingly hosted via Marc Romboy\u2019s legendary Systematic Recordings imprint, the 15-track assemblage readily exemplifies Pezzner\u2019s ongoing stylistic expansions. Featuring an extensive inventory of electronic music genres, subgenres, and hybrid-genres, his latest auditory artwork shares but one underlying similarity: pristine quality. While some critics remain dispassionate towards the more exploratory ends of the musical spectrum, the eloquently crafted \u2018Last Night In Utopia\u2019 still merits an undeniable appreciation on behalf of its listeners.\\r\\nContinuing his trajectory into 2014, David follows suit with his strongest release to date on the the decade strong, Crosstown Rebels. This time Pezzner teams up with Italian/Egyptian co-producer, Amina and B-side remix by Hotflush label boss Scuba.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier works by Pezzner repeat this same pattern: Dance music for the brain as well as the body. His 2010, LP for Freerange Records \u201dThe Tracks Are Alive\u201d is a 13 track walk through of his electro/organic sounding style, in full dance-floor mode traversing with ease between disco, house and techno. Beatportal wax lyrical how it \u201cblows like a cool breeze through the stale air of a market crowded with by-the-numbers deep house\u201d and Resident Advisor note the \u201crising, sizzling dub effects\u201d of his \u2018Blacklist\u2019 release, adding \u201ca steeliness to his refined contours\u201d. 5 Magazine coins Pezzner\u2019s work as \u201dFuture classics made for dance floors in the here and now\u201d, while Ibiza Voice describes it as \u201dLush and tense with a transcendental twist\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nClub shows abound not only in Europe, Pezzner\u2019s live shows and DJ sets regularly move the dance floors of some of the most renowned venues including Space Ibiza, Rex Club in Paris, Womb Tokyo, Fabric London, Cielo New York, and Chicago\u2019s famed Smartbar.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1765244,\"name\":\"Proqxis\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1765245,\"name\":\"Mr. Projectile\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Matthew Arnold aka Mr. Projectile has been an influential member of the electronic music community since 1992.  He has been DJing, playing live shows, organizing club nights, and one off shows throughout the US for over 20 years now.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Projectile has continually managed to keep an eclectic edge while always keeping his sights on what was new and interesting within the constantly changing electronic music world. His dedication to electronic miusic became more apparent when he began hosting the monthly music night in Minneapolis \\\"Hello Music\\\" which was one of the first minimal techno nights in the country, and now considered seminal by some. He released his first record on the UK's cult label Toytronic Records, which 15 years later has become a classic, known to sell for over $100.00 on ebay. He has gone on to release music on Studio K7, Parotic Records, Merck Records, Om, N5MD, No Records, Addictech, Benbecula, and on his own label Semisexual. He has toured the US and Europe several times over the years most notably being the opening act on Bassnectar\u2019s \u201cVava Voom Tour\u201d.  He was also nominated for best electronic musician by the Minnesota Music Awards in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has played shows from Dresden, Germany to Missoula, Montana alongside artists such as Plaid, Derrick Carter, EU, Bassnectar, Tipper, Thomas Fehlman, L\u2019usine, Jonah Sharp, Deru, and many others. Since it\u2019s inception in 2004, Matt has been a very large part of organizing the now infamous production company/Burning Man camp \u201cNexus\u201d out of the SF Bay area, focusing on helping to create unique environments designed to deepen the shared experience of dancing to music with one another.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHis ever-changing styles of production have always managed to lean towards the left of what is current in the electronic music world while focusing on the psychedelic and emotional edges of what music can be. His current live show is a mix of all types of feelings, genres, and tempos glued together with the idea that a show should make you feel something as well as dance.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1765246,\"name\":\"Todd Armstrong\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://holocene.org/event/1377295?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
