The singer of Samoan descent was born in Long Beach and raised in Compton, California. Growing up in the rough streets of Compton, the strong sense of tradition and culture that J Boog absorbed from his family was instrumental in his path to stay off the streets and begin a successful music career. \\r\\nAt the age of four, after hearing his older sister playing the piano, he developed an interest and started watching her and learning about music. Soon, J was singing along to the notes & melodies he heard his sister play. A while later, she brought home a Bob Marley song book. Even at this young age, J knew Bob's name and his music. Upon hearing his sister begin to play, something clicked inside J. He hasn't been the same since.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first time J Boog performed in front of an audience, he was nine years old. It was a large family reunion at a church and there were about 200 people present. J's mother and sister insisted for him to sing Whitney Houston's \\\"One Moment In Time\\\" and J obliged them. Though he was nervous, it went quite well.\\r\\n\\r\\nJ Boog's music career became serious in 2005, when a couple of brothers from his neighborhood brought him to one of J's favorite artists, George \\\"Fiji\\\" Veikoso\\\". The two began working together immediately and J ended up moving to Hawaii in 2006 to continue developing his craft. After releasing his debut album \\\"Hear Me Roar\\\" in 2007, he joined the musical family Wash House Music Inc, a record label based in Hawaii and San Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year later, in 2008, J Boog met Gramps Morgan of Morgan Heritage and there was an instant chemistry. Gramps was keen on working with J, and set out to make a way. Shortly after, Gramps, J Boog and other Wash House family members were in Jamaica recording in such prestigious places as Bob Marley's \\\"Tuff Gong\\\" Studio, Don Corleone's \\\"Hit Maker\\\", Bobby Digital's \\\"Digital B\\\", Shaggy's \\\"Big Yard\\\", Sugar Minott's \\\"Youth Man Promotion\\\" and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe results are apparent when listening to Boog's new music. It is authentic Island Music and genuine Jamaican reggae at the same time. Truly a new and exciting combination. There is a natural theme to Boog's writing: love. It recurs throughout his work and never once seems contrived. When you listen, you will feel he truly knows matters of the heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese days Boog is either in a studio, on a stage or catching a flight. Radio interviews have become a daily thing and it's a little overwhelming for the young artist, though he has been smart enough to keep his humility. He has a great sense of humor and an even better sense of reality. He can be overheard saying how blessed he is on a daily basis. It's easy to see why J Boog has been winning over fans when you meet him. He has the right spirit and attitude to carry him to the next level.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis new album, \\\"Backyard Boogie\\\" is slated for release September 27th 2011 and features Tarrus Riley, Jacob Hemphill (of SOJA), Peetah Morgan (of Morgan Heritage), Fiji and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading up to the release of his official new album, J Boog released the \\\"J Boog EP\\\" on June 14th 2011 via Wash House Hawaii/EMPIRE Distribution. The EP featured five brand new songs, along with three previously released songs, including his smash hits \\\"Let's Do It Again\\\" and \\\"So Far Gone\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1222},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":382},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":255},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-og.jpg\",\"width\":1463,\"height\":1863},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":127},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":637},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":828},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/39/29-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://jboogmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/jboog_music\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/jboogmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/JBoogMusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"JBoogMusic\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1580303,\"name\":\"Jo Mersa Marley\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1750225,\"name\":\"Jemere Morgan\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Jemere means \\\"wish come true.\\\" And if wishes come true, then Jemere is on his way to paving an exciting and successful musical career.
