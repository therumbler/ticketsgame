Duchovny\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Born and raised in New York City, Duchovny attended Princeton University (where he played one season as shooting guard on the school\u2019s basketball team), received his Masters Degree in English Literature from Yale and was on the road to earning his Ph.D. when he caught the acting bug.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequently, Duchovny emerged to become one of the most highly acclaimed actors in Hollywood.  The star of Fox Television\u2019s monster hit \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d David was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series, he was\\r\\nnominated for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his highly acclaimed and some say risqu\u00e9 appearances on THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW.  In January 1997, David won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series.  He has been nominated for a total of three Golden Globes, three Screen\\r\\nActors Guild and a TV Critic\u2019s Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series.  The press and the public both agree that Duchovny brings a fierce intellect, a quiet intensity and an acerbic wit to his roles on both the small screen and the silver screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince THE X-FILES debuted, millions and millions of self-proclaimed \u201cX-Philes\u201d spent their Sunday nights wide-eyed in anticipation as their hero, the brilliant and sullen FBI agent Fox Mulder,  explored cases deemed unbelievable or unsolvable\\r\\nby the Bureau.  Duchovny\u2019s remarkable performance on THE X-FILES earned him the title of \u201cZeitgeist Icon\u201d by Laura Jacobs in The New Republic and \u201cthe first Internet sex symbol with hair\u201d by Maureen Dowd in The New York Times.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid added the role of director to his already extensive list of accomplishments when he wrote, directed and starred in three critically acclaimed episodes of THE X-FILES, titled \u201cThe Unnatural\u201d, which starred Jessie Martin, and \u201cHollywood\\r\\nA.D.\u201d, starring Garry Shandling and actress Tea Leoni and \u201cWilliam\u201d. Other directing credits include the Fox hit series BONES, as well as, 6 episodes of CALIFORNICATION.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuchovny\u2019s passion for renegade films has brought him critical acclaim for his performances in the feature films KALIFORNIA, in which he costarred opposite Brad Pitt; THE RAPTURE, the controversial film directed by Michael Tolkin in which Duchovny starred opposite Mimi Rogers; and JULIA HAS TWO LOVERS, in\\r\\nwhich he turned in a much heralded performance as a telephone hustler.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuchovny played Roland \u201cRollie\u201d Totheroh, Charlie Chaplin\u2019s longtime confidante and cameraman in the Sir Richard Attenborough directed CHAPLIN, which starred Robert Downey, Jr. in the title role; and starred in the smash hit BEETHOVEN, opposite Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt, as the evil yuppie\\r\\ndetermined to take over Charles Grodin\u2019s company.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFeature credits include the Dreamworks action-comedy EVOLUTION, opposite Julianne Moore and directed by Ivan Reitman, the MGM romantic-comedy RETURN TO ME, opposite Minnie Driver, directed by Bonnie Hunt. THE X-FILES movie, PLAYING GOD, with Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie. David went on to appear in a hilariously funny cameo in Ben Stiller\u2019s film ZOOLANDER.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill recognized for his role as Dennis/Denise Bryson, the transvestite detective in David Lynch\u2019s breakthrough television series TWIN PEAKS, Duchovny also spent four seasons as the impassioned narrator of Zalman King\u2019s erotic anthology series\\r\\nRED SHOE DIARIES, which began as a feature length telefilm for Showtime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, he starred in the Miramax ensemble comedy FULL FRONTAL, for director Steven Soderbergh, co-starring Julia Roberts and George Clooney. David made brief returns to television, first appearing in good friend Bonnie Hunt\u2019s show, LIFE WITH BONNIE, in which he guest starred as over-the-top weatherman Johnny Volcano, for which he was nominated for an Emmy in 2003.  Following that, he made a memorable appearance on SEX AND THE CITY, as an ex-flame of Sarah\\r\\nJessica Parkers\u2019 \u201cCarrie Bradshaw\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made his feature directorial debut in 2005 with HOUSE OF D which he also wrote and appeared in. The film, which starred Robin Williams and Anton Yelchin, vividly captured the spirit of youth in all its joy and heartbreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther feature credits include TRUST THE MAN, in which he starred again with Julianne Moore and Eva Mendez, THE TV SET opposite Sigourney Weaver and Simon Helberg and directed by Jake Kasdan; the Dreamwork\u2019s feature THINGS\\r\\nWE LOST IN THE FIRE, opposite Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro for Susanne Bier; THE SECRET directed by Vincent Perez and produced by Luc Besson; THE X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE; and THE JONESES opposite Demi Moore and Amber Heard for director Derrick Borte.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid ventured onto the stage starring off Broadway in Neil LaBute\u2019s play BREAK OF NOON in which he reunited with his X-FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE co star Amanda Peet.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, he worked on the independent features GOATS opposite Vera Farmiga, Ty Burrell, Graham Phillips and Dakota Johnson; PHANTOM opposite Ed Harris and the independent feature LOUDER THAN WORDS opposite Hope Davis and Timothy Hutton.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis other long running series CALIFORNINCATION ended its 7 year run this past summer for Showtime. Hank Moody marked another seminal character portrayed by David that has made its way into our pop culture lexicon and for whose potrayal he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Comedy series.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first novel HOLY COW was released by Farrar Straus and Giroux in February 2015 and hit the New York Times Best Sellers list.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May of 2015, David completed his first studio album for Think Say Records and was distributed by Caroline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year, David can be seen in the Fox event series X-FILES, reuniting with Gillian Anderson and Chris Carter and the second season of AQUARIUS for Tomorrow Studios /NBC, which he also executive produced.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid splits his time between Los Angeles and New York and remains the only actor to have won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Television series in both the Comedy and Drama categories.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":657},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":205},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":137},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-og.png\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1402},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":68},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":342},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atxl1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atxxl.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":445},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/88/48-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-W2izQyHiTc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://www.facebook.com/DavidDuchovnyOfficial/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/davidduchovny\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"davidduchovny\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.thecrocodile.com/event/1377495?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
