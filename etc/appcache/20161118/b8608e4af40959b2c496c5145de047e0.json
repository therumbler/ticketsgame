Fowler\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\\\"We're coming to a honky tonk near you, A little hardcore troubadour\\r\\nhillbilly blues Bringing country back, a little  old a little  new\\r\\n,We're coming to a honky tonk near you\\\" The title  song off of the new album by independent veteran  country artist  Kevin Fowler \\r\\npretty well sums up his sound, approach, and endless work ethic.  Steeped in the old school  charm of classic country music, amped up with a modern energy all his own, and steadily touring from one packed house of honky tonk dieh ards to another, Kevin Fowler makes  music on his own terms for the thousands and thousands of loyal fans he's earned down  through the years.\\r\\nTo see Kevin Fowler in concert is  more than just a show: it'\\r\\ns an experience.  The Amarillo, Texas native's\\r\\nwild-eyed charisma breathes new life into old favorites like \\\"Beer Bait & Ammo\\\" and \\\"The Lord Loves A Drinkin' Man,\\\" \\r\\nhis twangy vocals riding atop the honky tonk groove of his ace backing band.  Few performers in country music are as naturally gifted at leading the crowd in a good time, whether it's in a crowded dancehall or the wide open spaces of an outdoor festival.\\r\\nAnd few things amp up a busy musician's energy level quite \\r\\nlike  a brand new album to release: this autumn, Kevin Fowler will  be bringing the freshnew material of Coming To A Honky Tonk Near Youto his fans around the nation \\\"Sometimes the recording process can be grueling, but this record was a pleasure to make,\\\" \\r\\nFowler beams when asked about the new project.\\r\\n\\\"\\r\\nI recorded it with my good buddy Trent Willmon. \\r\\nI think it  really shows in the final product when you are just having a great time making music with  your friends. \\\"It's a downhome feast of new tunes, kicked  off by the aforementioned theme song that lays out Fowler and his band's mission to bring real\\r\\n-deal country music to the people that love and appreciate it  the most.  According to the man himself, \\\"As I was trying to decide which songs to cut, these eight songs stood out to me and immediately  became my favorites. I think  our \\r\\nfans are going to love this record as much as I do. This is best thing I've done since Loose, Loud and Crazyand I can't wait for everyone to hear it.\\\"Listeners may have \\r\\nalready caught the first single, \\\"Sellout Song,\\\" or the accompanying video; a collaboration with fellow Texas songwriter Zane Williams, it's Fowler's catchy comical take on the modern trend of hip\\r\\n-hop beats and phrases finding their way into mainstream Top 40 \\r\\ncountry music.  Elsewhere he rattles off drunken advent\\r\\nures on one number (\\\"Bouncer\\\") then switches gears to the sincere, humble likes of \\\"Living Proof\\\" or the affectionate ode to his home state on \\\"Texas Forever.\\\"Speaking of Texas, it would be hard to understand Kevin Fowler's unique spot in the \\r\\nmodern musicaluniverse without a little  context of just what his home state has meant to his career.  The Lone Star State, for those who aren't already familiar, has a  healthy regional country music industry that's largely independent of the Nashville system. I\\r\\nt's a breeding ground for singers, songwriters, and musicians steeped in traditional country but empowered to write and play the kind of music that doesn't necessarily conform to modern \\r\\ntrends and expectations.  After an early stint  playing guitar in the popular '80s metal band Dangerous Toys \\r\\n\u2013did we mention that he's had an unconventional music career? \\r\\n\u2013Fowler steered hard back towards his country roots, forming his own band and playing the sort of songs his deep Texas twang was always best suited for anyway.\\r\\nThat detour wasn't an easy path :countless miles on the road, long nights on cramped stages in front of small crowds, and recording on a shoestring budget just to get his new original songs heard.  But \\r\\nyear after year it paid off.  Those crowds got bigger and bigger, those songs found their way onto regional playlists,  and those self\\r\\n-produced records started to sell well into the tens of \\r\\nthousands.  Within a few years there were enough Kevin Fowler fans out there to pack the biggest honky\\r\\n-tonks in Texas and beyond making him one of the state's most popular acts\\\"\\r\\nI think some bands have fans, but our fans are more like my road family,\\\" Fowler affectionately claims.\\r\\n\\\"They have been coming to our shows and having fun with  us for \\r\\nover 16 years now.\\\"With that kind of momentum, even the Nashville music industry couldn't help but notice and Fowler couldn't help but take the gamble on extending the reach of his music across \\r\\nthe country and beyond.  It paid off in many ways: he landed deals with  a couple of Nashville record labels, charted with a handful of singles (including the Top 40 hit \\\"Pound Sign\\\") and albums, recorded a duet with the legendary George Jones\\r\\n, toured Europe and worked with  other hitmakers like  Sammy Kershaw, Mark Chesnutt,and Montgomery Gentry.  Along the way he saw his home state popularity continue to soar and landed atop \\r\\nthe bill at some of Texas' biggest festivals.  By the time he stepped back into the independent scene with  his 2014 release \\r\\nHow Country Are Ya?, homegrown acts that \\r\\nFowler had influenced and collaborated with Granger Smith, Cody Johnson, and Josh Abbott among them \\r\\n\u2013were joining him at the top of the list of the region's most in demand artists. In the year 2016,Fowler can proudly say, \\\"This is our eighth studio albumand I really think it s going to be a fan favorite.\\\" And Kevin Fowler still is what he always was: a \\\"Panhandle Poorboy\\\" from Amarillo who loved country music so much that one day he decided to make \\r\\nhis own, who has figured out how to do it  bigger and better over two decades of hard work, dedication, and always going that extra mile  to reach out to the fans that make it all \\r\\npossible.  Still \\\"Loose, Loud, & Crazy,\\\" still \\\"100% Texan,\\\" and always Coming to A Honky \ufeffTonk Near You.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-og.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/13-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"6JkzRNkhcQs\",\"title\":\"Kevin Fowler -- 100 Percent Texan\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JkzRNkhcQs\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JkzRNkhcQs\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.kevinfowler.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/kevinfowler\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/KevinFowlerMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/kevinfowler\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"kevinfowler\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1724065,\"name\":\"Twangsters Union\",\"startTime\":\"2016-11-19 21:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"\u200b\u200bTwangsters Union grabs an audience with powerful heartfelt ballads and great dance favorites - keeping people on their feet for hours.
