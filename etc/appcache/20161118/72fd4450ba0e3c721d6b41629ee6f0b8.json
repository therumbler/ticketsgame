Union\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Ben Union is a Seattle-based artist that creates diverse pop music with an unconventional edge.\\r\\nIn an era of artists adhering to the rules of culture and genre, Ben Union is a visionary wind of change bringing rock-n-roller attitude to a pop genre that is in desperate need of innovation. From inception, Ben Union has never followed the script. Whether filling up school busses to carry fans to venues in other cities, to jumping off of upper balconies into crowds, lighting people on fire in packed theaters, or giving his entire music collection away to his fans for free, he does things HIS WAY. His unorthodox approach to the music industry and the way business is typically done is groundbreaking, and his devotion to independent success and his fans is impossible to ignore.\\r\\nUnion's commitment to nonconformity bleeds into every aspect of his pioneering journey, and he isn't afraid to speak his mind or stick to his guns. Topically, nothing is off limits for Ben Union; Religion, elected officials, drugs, love and more are officially fair game with no apologies. Ben Union is real, honest, and uncompromising.\\r\\nBen Union was formed in 2009 in Tacoma, Washington during an impromptu jam session that included front man, Ben, and drummer, Jared. Eventually, guitarist and bassist, Talon and Derek, would join the project. From the start, Ben Union turned heads. There were no proper recordings of his music, but for a couple of live room demos, so he dove headfirst into playing live shows. The temperament of his act showed from the very beginning when he refused to settle for any other venue than the biggest in town, even when initially turned down due to a lack of show history in town. On a last-minute cancellation at the club, Ben Union was offered an opportunity to headline on a Saturday night and packed the house, earning him a reputation overnight for high-energy shows and bringing a serious crowd. The movement gained fans quickly by developing relationships with show-goers, involving the fans in the growth process, and showing great skill for promotion through offering incentive to loyal followers.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/96/78-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.benunion.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/benunion\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/benunion\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"benunion\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":996395,\"name\":\"The Hollers\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"In a music industry filled with auto-tune, synths, and Dubstep Seattle's indie rock outfit The Hollers have set out to pave their own path while staying true to their roots.

Our sound is unique but pulls elements of our\\r\\nfavorite genres: soul, funk, hip-hop, R&B, jazz, gospel, and rock,\\\" says\\r\\nSarah Clarke, the resounding, and resonating, front woman for Portland,\\r\\nOregon-based Dirty Revival.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso comprised of Evan \\\"evv'n'flo\\\" Simko (M.C., guitar), Terry Drysdale\\r\\n(drums), Karl Ludwigsen (keyboards), Jon Shaw (bass), Chris Hardin (tenor\\r\\nsax), and Jon Clay (trumpet), the septet shines on their self-titled,\\r\\ndebut full-length.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Someone once described us as Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Earth Wind\\r\\nand Fire, and Rose Royce all blended up as one,\\\" Clarke says of the\\r\\ncomparisons her band has already started to receive. \\\"I nearly fainted.\\r\\nWhat a massive compliment.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nExpanding on that, Simko says, \\\"I think people will find a great variety\\r\\nof influences or comparisons, to name a few: P-Funk, Aretha Franklin,\\r\\nJames Brown, Bill Withers, Charles Bradley, Jill Scott, Erykah Badu,\\r\\nD'Angelo, and The Roots. It's hard to say. I think there are so many\\r\\ninfluences that it won't quite sound like anyone in particular.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir debut is a representation of all of this, a melting pot of\\r\\ninfluences and personalities, with all five members getting their voice,\\r\\nliterally and metaphorically, contained within the sounds of the album.\\r\\nWhile navigating different musical waters, the album also vacillates\\r\\nbetween fiercely political uprisings to down and gritty party jams that\\r\\nare meant to make you smile and dance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The album is about honesty,\\\" says Clarke. \\\"It is candid and sincere, the\\r\\nsame way we as a group approach music in general. 'Breathe' is a song\\r\\ndecrying the racial tensions in our society as we see it. 'Lay Me Down' is\\r\\nabout the brutal affect addiction has on people. 'Take It Off' is a take\\r\\non lust. \\\"Make It\\\" is about the need for personal betterment. And then\\r\\nthere are songs like 'Dirty Love,' which highlights our passion for\\r\\nperformance. Essentially, every song on this album is an unadulterated\\r\\ntake on music and the world that we see every day.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAdds Drysdale, \\\"It's serious when it needs to be and fun the rest of the\\r\\ntime.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band decided on self-titling their debut, as a representation of who\\r\\nthey are.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"[This album is] our soul and identity as a group. We've spent the last\\r\\nthree years writing, touring, and playing shows, all the while our sound\\r\\nhas been evolving into what it is now, Dirty Revival, and the self-titled\\r\\nroute just felt appropriate,\\\" comments Drysdale.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile self-describing themselves as \\\"soul-hop,\\\" and stating that at the\\r\\ncore they're a soul band, anyone that listens to Dirty Revival will hear\\r\\nso much more than just a soul group, something the band is very proud of,\\r\\nand really set out to accomplish on their debut.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"There's a lot of throwback soul out there that's really great, and is a\\r\\nbig influence for us, but we differ in that we're not trying to 100%\\r\\nemulate that style,\\\" says Shaw. \\\"We take a lot of pop music cues from the\\r\\n70s, 80s, and 90s and then use classic soul as a lens to focus our ideas\\r\\ninto a song. With this album we're casting a wide net of influences to\\r\\nhelp us hone our sound. After this whole process, I think we're really\\r\\nstarting to get there.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe record is as natural as the band's beginnings, with no long\\r\\ndiscussions or debates, just things gelling and making sense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"People always ask how we picked the name Dirty Revival. I can never think\\r\\nof anything cool to say, that is just who we are. The day we came up with\\r\\nthat name it wasn't a big, long conversation, it was just accepted as\\r\\nfact,\\\" remembers Clarke. \\\"Over the last couple of years we have been\\r\\ngrowing into our own name and our music has begun to take on a unique\\r\\nsound. If you listen to our EP, The May Fourth Edition, and then to the\\r\\nmusic we have written in the last year and a half you will hear some of\\r\\nthe same gritty sound in the EP, but with less direction, less purpose.\\r\\nThis album represents us learning to musically articulate as a group,\\r\\ntaking five different voices and blending them together in one strong and\\r\\nharmonious statement. Calling the album Dirty Revival is our way of\\r\\nintroducing ourselves to the world as a unit, we are putting ourselves out\\r\\nthere. This is who we are. Take it or leave it...but hopefully take it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAdds Drysdale: \\\"The music was recorded live. This is how we sound when we\\r\\nplay; the underlying force and energy behind each track is the band\\r\\nplaying and tracking together in the studio. Most of the vocals were\\r\\nrecorded live, too. Dirty Revival is just that, it's Dirty Revival here;\\r\\nno tricks, layers, or studio magic - we performed these tracks and\\r\\ncaptured that in the recording.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the album's highlights for the band is the political \\\"Breathe,\\\" a\\r\\nhard-hitting, honest song that confronts the big issue of the racial and\\r\\nsocial-class issues we're facing today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"'I am not on my own, please say that you'll agree...'\\\" Those are the\\r\\nbeginning lyrics in the chorus of 'Breathe.' The lyric resonates with me\\r\\nbecause of its obvious meaning in the song, it's about solidarity in\\r\\nresponse to the current events of police brutality and racism,\\\" comments\\r\\nSimko. \\\"But I also think of it as having a broader meaning; it is a\\r\\nstatement about how nothing can be done alone. Accomplishing a dream,\\r\\nsupporting each other as a community, and even making an album, and\\r\\npursuing a career. There has been so much support and positive feedback in\\r\\nour efforts and we hope to return all the love by make a positive impact\\r\\non our fans and friends.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore entering the studio, the band rehearsed more than ever before,\\r\\nfine-tuning what they thought would be every detail of the songs. However,\\r\\nonce they hit the studio, they encountered many challenges, and realized\\r\\nhow time consuming it really is to record seventeen people, including\\r\\ndrums, bass, guitar, keys, lead vocals, four horns, three back-up singers,\\r\\na string quartet, and percussion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This is my first experience working on an album,\\\" admits Clarke. \\\"So,\\r\\nwhen we started talking strings, percussion, punch-ins, synths, and\\r\\neverything else, I was having a hard time connecting with the idea of\\r\\nthese embellishments. It just seemed so over the top. Then I started doing\\r\\nsomething I had never truly done and began listening to music with a hyper\\r\\ncritical ear. It was crazy to really focus on some of my favorite albums,\\r\\npulling things out of the mix I had never really heard before. In some\\r\\nways, that made the music come to life again. If you can imagine hearing\\r\\nthe same songs over and over again, day in and day out, hearing them with\\r\\nthose subtle changes makes a world of difference. The final product is\\r\\nbetter than I could have imagined and I am still finding little things\\r\\nthat make me excited when I listen to it. \\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I think this was a good learning experience,\\\" confirms Ludwigsen. \\\"The\\r\\nquality of our songs really surprised me. \\\"I mean, you play them all the\\r\\ntime and then when you have a chance to finally hear it back, I just\\r\\nthought, 'Wow! I like that.'\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, with the record done, the band just wants to get their music out\\r\\nthere, share it with people, and hope that those people want them to come\\r\\nto their city and play live for them. And, the band, will be happy to\\r\\noblige, with heavy touring this fall into next year slated in support of\\r\\nDirty Revival.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":636},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":132},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":132},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1356},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":331},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":331},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":430},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/21-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":430}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pjw-qzT6qBs\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.dirtyrevivalpdx.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/dirtyrevival\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1772556,\"name\":\"BOOBOOLALA\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"5 cats just writing/playing what feels good, sounds good, and gets people shaking their a*s.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atjmbo.JPG\",\"width\":810,\"height\":811},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atjmbo1.JPG\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atlg.JPG\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atlg1.JPG\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atmd.JPG\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atmd1.JPG\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-og.JPG\",\"width\":810,\"height\":811},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atsm.JPG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atsm1.JPG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-sq.JPG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-sqsm.JPG\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atxl.JPG\",\"width\":500,\"height\":501},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atxl1.JPG\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atxxl.JPG\",\"width\":650,\"height\":651},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/97/17-atxxl1.JPG\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe src=\\\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/160803841\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"360\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://vimeo.com/160803841\\\">BoobooLaLa: &quot;Wasted&quot;<\\/a> from <a href=\\\"https://vimeo.com/user25780897\\\">Jack Saffle<\\/a> on <a href=\\\"https://vimeo.com\\\">Vimeo<\\/a>.<\\/p>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.thecrocodile.com/event/1384349?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
