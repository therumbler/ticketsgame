Their second album for RidingEasy, it is a breakout moment for the band as a whole and for vocalist Laura Dolan, who stands tall in the spotlight throughout \u201cEvil,\u201d \u201cMisery Keeper\u201d and the rest of Higher Time, rising to the occasion of a fuller, bigger sound and meeting the memorable riffing of husband/guitarist Ross Dolan head on with already-stuck-in-your-head hooks and a fiery, passionate delivery.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike its predecessor, Higher Time was recorded at The Diamonds studio in Cincinnati by Brian Olive (The Greenhornes, Dan Auerbach, Dr. John, etc.), and in search of an even more expansive feel, Laura, Ross and Brian traveled to mix the album alongside Black Keys engineer Collin Dupuis at Easy Eye in Nashville, TN. The results speak for themselves. In Laura\u2019s performance and in the multi-faceted approach of Ross alongside bassist Randy Proctor and drummer Nate Wagner, Electric Citizen branch out with stage-born assurance across a collection of definitive rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It is a bold, complete sound that sacrifices nothing of the band\u2019s on-stage energy and clearly demonstrates that while their progression has been quick, it\u2019s been hard won the traditional way: They worked their collective ass off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe chose producer Brian Olive because he's an excellent musician with a great ear for rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, and a good friend that we trust,\u201d notes Laura. The dividends of that trust can be heard in \u201cGhost of Me,\u201d the rolling \u201cNatural Law\u201d or \u201cDevils in the Passing Time,\u201d as Electric Citizen brazenly refuse to be pigeonholed and craft a style that, like every stage they step onto, is completely their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nElectric Citizen spread their name far and wide on tours with Fu Manchu, Wolfmother, Budos Band and Pentagram for Sateen.

On the eve of their 10 year anniversary Swedish hardrock band HORISONT are pleased to announce the next chapter in their illustrious career by putting pen to paper and confirming a worldwide deal with Century Media Records. New album in progress, stay tuned!\\r\\n\\r\\nBIOGRAHPY, August, 2015.\\r\\nBig of moustache and tight of trouser, Horistont drink from the bottomless wellspring of inspiration that's been bubbling up through the layers of time since the birth of the blues \u2013 or Blue Oyster Cult at the very least.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheirs is a sound that harks back to the dawn of the 70s, when a new clutch of heads decided it was time to harsh the 60s hippies' mellow and paint it black; those years when the twin spirit of hard rock and prog rose to redefine sound.\\r\\nIn their earlier years Horisont looked and sounded like the last guys standing at the world's wildest and darkest party; these are the tight bro's who laced the punch, torched the dance-floor and rode off into the night on their roaring hogs in a puff of green smoke. \\\"Put the five soldiers of Horisont in a time machine 50 years ahead of time and we would still rock the silver socks of any future man, woman or robot,\\\" frontman Axel once declared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis quintet's rock trip might be retro but their songwriting is timeless; a good melody lives forever and Horisont have songs in abundance. New album Odyssey is exactly as its title suggests: an epic journey into the known. A sonic trip. A mighty voyage of sound. You could even call their fourth full release a concept album \u2013 although they themselves prefer \\\"space saga\\\". Either way it's a brave band who open their album with a ten minute-long track, yet on the album's title track Horisont dive straight into the deep end, delivering space-rock with all the dexterity and deftness of the very best prog rock's finest, such as early Yes or Kansas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I think it was Tom, who during a tour, said that it would be fun to write a ten minute song,\\\" says bassist Magnus Delborg.\\\"When that song took shape the idea of a cohesive album was born. Most of the songs are in some way connected to the bigger theme, so \u2013 yes \u2013 it is a concept album. It concerns a supreme race of mysterious being who experiment with the creation of life and start to populate planets around the universe. And this is the story of one of those planets\u2026\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFormed in 2006, Horisont have spent close to a decade kicking ass, taking names and establishing themselves at the forefront of the Scandinavian retro rock revival (see also Witchcraft, Graveyard etc), injecting their sound with early-Status Quo-styled boogie blues, prog complexities, NWOBHM swagger and fire-spitting choruses set to scorch the eyebrows of the first ten rows. This is music made without irony, unafraid to acknowledge an allegiance to past greats such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Cactus, Thin Lizzy, the aforementioned Yes and Judas Priest.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first two albums Tva Sidor Av Horisonten (2009) and Second Assault (2012) earned Horisont a special place in the rock underground, while Time Warriors (2013) was a no-holds barred demonstration of classic rock and metal combined with a fearlessly inventive streak, and took them to a wider international audience. And now comes Odyssey, a bold leap into more expansive and ethereal musical territory. It's the band's first to feature native Australian and former Church Of Misery guitarist Tom Sutton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new line-up change sees a definite gear-shift too. Here Horisont play as if their lives depend upon it: dueling guitars do battle in an endlessly thrilling interplay over a rhythm section that gallops like wild horses across the frozen tundra. And cutting through the middle, Axel S\u00f6derberg's howling heartfelt vocals delivered with a space-age sense of soulfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are surprises aplenty throughout \u2013 witness the melodic Jethro Tull-style breakdown in the middle of 'Blind Leder Blind', flamenco/folk flourishes on 'Flying', the fist pumping classic metal anthem of 'Back On The Streets', the almost Ziggy Stardust-esque 'Beyond The Sun' or the elegiac eight minute long album closer 'Timmarna', which evokes the awesome beauty of a dying star careering off into darker distant universe. Then there's the majestic former single 'Break The Limit', which was accompanied by a gloriously grainy 1980s VHS-style video, complete with much split screen action. This is expansive, emotive music that's far more than five hirsute men creating a voluminous ruckus.\\r\\n\\r\\nOdyssey was recorded in Studio Kust in Gothenburg with producer by Henrik Magnusson. It was, the band explain their most harmonious creative period ever.\\\"No Horisont recording session has ever been this good,\\\" admits Delborg. \\\"We had worked with Henrik on our 'Break The Limit' single and knew that he was our guy. All the basics where recorded live in just a couple of days. Then we spent a lot of time on the intricate details.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artwork for Odyssey harks back to both classic sci-fi paperbacks and prime prog rock albums of the 70s. \\\"We wanted a slightly disturbed, Asimov-esque science fiction cover that told the story of Odyssey,\\\" says drummer Pontus Jordan. \\\"Tom knew this guy who was really in to old science fiction stuff and he had done the cover for The Order Of Israfel. So we meet the guy and it was the one and only Henrik Jacobsen. And he really nailed it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStrap in, sit back and let the Odyssey begin\u2026\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":686},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":214},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":143},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-og.jpg\",\"width\":1100,\"height\":786},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":71},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":357},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":464},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/29-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.horisontmusic.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/horisontmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":769873,\"name\":\"Mothership\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Rock n\u2019 Roll history is rife with brothers working together to create their artistic vision. But rarely do we hear about a full-fledged family unit embarking down the treacherous path of a musical career. In the case of Texas based Mothership, the Brother Juett (Kyle on bass, younger brother Kelley on guitar) enlisted the aid of their father, John Juett, to help get the \u2018ship off the ground. Raised on a healthy dose of their father\u2019s 70\u2019s-era record collection, the brothers began crafting songs fueled on the raucous and raw good time vibe when music seemed to know no bounds. Lifting off the pad for the first time in 2010, the band began to gain momentum and notoriety with their unabashed live shows. Knowing that the\\r\\nservice of the family patriarch was temporary, Father Juett actively helped his boys find his replacement, and in late 2011, enter the mighty Judge Smith to hammer away on the skins.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2012, Mothership entered Crystal Clear Studios with Wo Fat mastermind Kent Stump manning the boards and by mid-year, the band self-released their debut album. It was the combination of the 70\u2019s-era heavy rock fuzz and fury mixed with the blistering guitar solos of the NWOBHM-era that drew the bands attention to California-based Heavy Rock label, Ripple Music. In the waning months of 2012, after a successful year of traveling regionally throughout Texas and opening for national acts such as Prong, Red Fang, Gypsyhawk, Monster Magnet, and Lo-Pan, Mothership officially dubbed Ripple Music as its Home Port. With the official Ripple Music release of the band\u2019s debut record in February of 2013, Mothership began a torrid journey across America and parts of Canada to promote the record, including a tour in support of Gyspyhawk and another in support of Scorpion Child and Kadavar. Currently, the band is holed up in the studio working on new material and plotting a course across Europe in Spring of 2014.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":571},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":178},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":178},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":119},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":119},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":571},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":59},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":59},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":297},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":297},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":387},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/98/51/89-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":387}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/mothershipusa/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1737911,\"name\":\"Huffer\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Curtain-Club-Deep-Ellem/1978485635790191336057?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
