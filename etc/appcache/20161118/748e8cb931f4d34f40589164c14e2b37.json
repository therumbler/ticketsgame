It takes a compelling voice, impressive musical chops and songs that are both entertaining and insightful. It also helps to have a passion for making music that leaps from the speakers, grabs the listener by the ears and settles in their heart.  Hudson Moore is that caliber of artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoore is quickly earning fans with his engaging, self-assured voice and his awe-inducing musical skills. His new single, \u201cSome Are,\u201d off GETAWAY has people scratching their heads in disbelief when they see the video because each camera shot reveals Moore\u2019s musical dexterity as he plays EVERY instrument in the video (drums, bass, acoustic and electric guitar, 6 string banjo, keys and harmony vocals).\\r\\n\\r\\nMoore, whose reputation as a great live performer has earned him opening slots for ZZ Top, Alan Jackson, Pat Green, Rascal Flatts and Gary Clark Jr. said, \\\"music has always been my biggest passion. I love it all - performing live, writing songs and recording in the studio. For better or for worse, I write or co-write all of my songs and do the vast majority of guitar work and overdubs on my albums. There are plenty of session guys out there who are much more talented than I am, but I enjoy adding my personal touch and playing as many instruments on my songs as I can. Each instrument allows me to express myself in different way.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMoore has a creative hand in everything he does from the production of his albums to the arrangements, the mix you hear, and the videos you see.  Hudson hand selected a small, but tight group of musicians to help fill out the sound of the album.  In addition to co-writing each of the songs on Getaway, Moore played eleven instruments during the recording process.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Moore, making music is as natural as breathing and it\u2019s a passion that began when he was just a child. \u201cI\u2019m a musician first and foremost.  I started playing the guitar and drums around 10 years old, then fell into singing and writing songs when I was about 16,\u201d he says.  Some of my earliest musical influences were guys like Tim McGraw, Keith Urban, and Vince Gill. I remember when I was 6 years old, my dad took us to see Tim McGraw live in Dallas and Kenny Chesney opened the show. We had been wearing out Tim's album, \\\"Everywhere\\\" that whole year. My brothers and I knew every word to every song. I'll never forget the feeling of watching Tim take control of the crowd like that. It was a really powerful moment for me. I didn't realize then that one day I'd be performing on stage as well, but I think that was when the seed was planted for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a listener, I've always been equally drawn to the music, hooks and melodies as I have the lyrics. Growing up listening to guys like Keith Urban and Vince Gill, I noticed the guitar was always at the forefront of their songs. That really stuck with me and I think a lot of that sound has made its way into my music.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMoore has expanded on the musical foundation provided by his heroes and forged his own distinct sound teaming with youthful energy and anchored by memorable melodies and relatable lyrics.  And though he has the musical skill and vocal talent to succeed in any genre, there was never any doubt he\u2019d call Country Music his home. \u201cHonestly the fans bring it home for me,\u201d says Moore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Country music fans are some of the most passionate and loyal fans in the world. When I play for them, I feel like I'm playing for my friends and family. Like most people, I enjoy all different types of music: rock, pop, blues, r&b  - but country music is at the root of it all for me. It's at the core of who I am as an artist and why I got into music to begin with. \u201c\\r\\n\\r\\nMoore\u2019s talent and buoyant personality have earned him a broad and enthusiastic fan base. His debut album, \u201cFireworks,\u201d spawned the hit single of the same title, \u201cFireworks,\u201d which soared to No. 1 on the Texas Music chart and held that spot for two weeks.  His songs have appeared in TV and films, including the 2013 western film \u201cSweetwater\u201d starring Ed Harris, January Jones and Jason Aldean, which featured Moore\u2019s \u201cCold Grey Light of Dawn\u201d over the closing credits.  \u201cIt was really fun to have a song featured in a film at Sundance. Especially being a western. I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of Western films\u201d he says. \u201cWe went up there and watched it on the big screen at the premiere and walked the red carpet and everything. It was really exciting.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMoore has also developed a reputation as a strong live performer and has opened for many of his musical heroes as well as headlining his own shows in notable venues such as Billy Bob\u2019s Texas, the world\u2019s largest honky tonk and Gruene Hall. \u201cTexas crowds aren\u2019t always the easiest crowds to win over because they have so much great music to choose from,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to cut your teeth as an artist. There are so many great cities and venues to play in Texas.  If you can win over Texas crowds, it\u2019ll really help build your confidence as a performer.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the release of GETAWAY, Moore continues to solidify his reputation as one of country\u2019s most gifted young artists. He co-produced his new set with Dwight A. Baker, an Austin-based songwriter/producer who has worked with Kelly Clarkson, Brandi Carlile, Bob Schneider, Blue October, Alpha Rev among others.  \u201cWe really hit it off,\u201d Moore says with a grin.  \u201cI told him I had a clear vision of how I wanted my record to sound and he said, \u2018Man, I just want to help get your vision across and let you be you.\u2019  He was really supportive and it was just a perfect fit. I have a specific sound I was going for and Dwight encouraged me to be me rather than steer me in a direction that I didn\u2019t want to go.  I was able to lead the ship and he was there to support me and push me to give my best performance, along with that of the musicians we were recording with.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lead single, \u201cSome Are,\u201d showcases Moore\u2019s potent skills as a musician as well as his rich, smooth vocals. \u201cIt\u2019s a feel good song, that\u2019s nostalgic at the same time\u201d says Moore. \u201cIt\u2019s about the special people you encounter in life that managed to drive you crazy, make you open up that door and go the extra mile to get that smile or that kiss\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother highlight on the new project is \u201cSand in the Bed.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite songs on the record,\u201d he says of the lilting, romantic tune he penned with J.T. Hodges and Andrew Petroff. \u201cI had the title and texted it out to the guys. Immediately they both said, we\u2019ve got to write this!\u2019 Everyone\u2019s wheels were spinning and at the end of the session, we had a full work tape of the song.  It\u2019s a sexy, honeymoon song that reflects on the time you have with that special person. It\u2019s hopefully a song that will take people to that place when they listen to it. I\u2019m really happy with the way it turned out\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoore\u2019s excitement for making music is contagious and whether on stage or off, there\u2019s a simmering energy that makes a conversation with him a delight and a concert so galvanizing that it\u2019s experience not to be missed.  His passion fuels everything he does and it leaves a lasting impression on those who cross his path. \u201cLife\u2019s too short to be doing something you\u2019re not passionate about. I\u2019m chasing my dream and doing what I love and I hope that I\u2019ll be able to inspire others to do what they love as well,\u201d he says.  My hope is that my music will help people get through that hard time in their life, or be that song they put on when they\u2019re falling in love or hanging out with friends on a Friday night. In some a way, I want to be a small part of the soundtracks of peoples lives.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/33/96/47-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/HudsonMooreMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1755863,\"name\":\"Tyler Dial\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/tylerdialmusic/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/tylerdialmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"tylerdialmusic\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1354733?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
