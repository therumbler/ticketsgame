Experimenting with beat-making in his teen years, he befriended fellow Stones Throw label-mate Knxwledge and the two formed the influential Klipmode collective along with Devonwho and Suzi Analogue. Mndsgn's music flourished when he moved to Los Angeles, quickly catching the attention of Stones Throw who released Yawn Zen, a LP of complex, introspective beat creations punctuated by intriguing vocal cuts. Mndsgn then toured the globe, co-found Akashik Records & Tapes, and provided the beat for \\\"Sweeny Song\\\", a high profile collaboration with underground rap superstar Danny Brown. With a hectic year behind him, Mndsgn began work on his sophomore LP, Body Wash. \\n\\nAs he began writing new material during a move between houses, Mndsgn decided that a fictional backstory could serve as a loose narrative thread through which he could filter his unformed ideas. In the narrative, a homeless man encounters a mysterious woman who gives him shelter. She instructs him to bathe with a very peculiar body wash. As he soaks and sinks deeper in a thick lather of this unknown solution, the man finds himself transported to an alternate dimension. He sets off through vibrant pastures of multicolored foliage and ethereal landscapes in pursuit of the enchanting woman's energy, with Akashic memories vividly flooding back to his psyche. He'd been here before. The tale ends in suspense, with lingering questions of which world was more real than the other. Mndsgn describes the story as a vessel \\\"that would allow me to speak on topics that were universally relatable\u2026 The story actually became a true outlet for me to address worldly issues with Self.\\\" The resultant album not only shows nuanced self exploration, but also represents a dynamic step forward in songwriting. Without explicitly relating its plot or characters, the album as a whole turns on the story's key theme-- the psychedelic, transformative power of love.\\n\\nBody Wash is a  full set of realized songs that were only hinted at on Yawn Zen. Influences here include the likes of early SOLAR records material, Leon Sylvers III, Kashif, and Dave Grusin-- artists that Mndsgn says \\\"really embodied that potent feeling in the early 80s boogie/funk/soul/jazz/fusion wave.\\\" He adds, \\\"I was also digging back into some early 90s R&B sounds and started really imagining what it would be like if I had mashed the two eras together.\\\" This mashup works magically, a clean synthesis of anthems (\\\"Cosmic Perspective\\\"), romantic reflections (\\\"Ya Own Way\\\" and \\\"Guess It's All Over\\\") and Mndsgn's R&B proclivities (\\\"Lather\\\" and \\\"Vague//Recalibrate\\\"). The artist explains Body Wash as \\\"a soul record that plays with nostalgic elements in a very dynamic & positive way. Think about it as a box of crayons for you to draw emotions with.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":286},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":286},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":215},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":143},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-og.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":286},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":72},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":286},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":286},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":286},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/54/51-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":286}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://mndsgn.bandcamp.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/MNDSGN/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/mndsgn\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"mndsgn\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1766636,\"name\":\"Swarvy\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"From Philadelphia\u2026 Now located in Los Angeles\u2026\\n\\nProduce, play bass/gtr/drums/keys, make tracks, and other various audio work...also teach too.\\n\\nMay have worked with somebody you know.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.swarvy.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/MarkusSwarvy?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1737765,\"name\":\"Survival Skills\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"'Survival Skills (aka Aaron Bergeson) is a long time Portland based musician, an electronic producer with releases on Cavity Search Records, Radio Host of Beat Parlor Mon-Thurs 11-Midnight on KMHD 89.1 FM, and live DJ.'\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"https://survivalskills.bandcamp.com/album/portland-oregon\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://aaronbergeson.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1766637,\"name\":\"Philip Grass\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Philip Grass is the electronic project helmed by Burton Schaber and Ben Durfee.

Their sound is characterized by an uncompromising instinct for change, as shuffling drums and moody pitch-shifted vocals can give way to riotous synth chords, jazz samples, or any number of other possible vibes. One can usually best identify a Philip Grass track by the sense of nocturnal nostalgia that permeates their melodic sensibility.
