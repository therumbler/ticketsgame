Whether it\u2019s the Beach Boys or the Everly Brothers\u2014or, more recently, First Aid Kit\u2014absorbing the same breathing rhythms and speech patterns adds an element to vocal harmonies that can be pure magic. With the release of I\u2019m Alone, No You\u2019re Not, the mesmerizing, hypnotic sound of the trio known as Joseph\u2014made up of sisters Allison, Meegan, and Natalie Closner\u2014joins this elite company.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s just second nature, like a fifth limb that\u2019s already on you,\u201d says first-born Natalie. \u201cThere\u2019s an ability to anticipate what\u2019s going to happen and blend with it. When Meegan and Allison sing, they know exactly what I\u2019m going to do and when.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Closners didn\u2019t actually start singing together when they were growing up in Oregon, the children of artistic parents (their dad was a jazz singer and drummer, their mom a theater teacher). Natalie was the performer\u2014\u201cthe older sister who stood on the edge of the fireplace and told everyone, \u2018Watch me!,\u2019\u201c she says. Twins Meegan and Allison stayed out of her lane, joining in for their mother\u2019s musical theater productions but otherwise avoiding the spotlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Natalie was in college, she began pursuing music more seriously. The summer before her senior year, she went to Nashville to check out the scene and work on her guitar playing and songwriting. She had recorded an EP and done a few rounds of touring when a friend sat her down one day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt was kind of dramatic,\u201d she says, \u201cHe took me aside and said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you really believe in this.\u2019 It stopped me in my tracks.\u201d She thought deeply about the music she was making and had a curious epiphany; she decided to ask her sisters if they would consider singing with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, they didn\u2019t really get it. \u201cWe thought she was asking us to be background singers, so we didn\u2019t take it that seriously,\u201d says Allison. \u201cIt was more commitment than I was expecting\u2014I even tried to leave at one point, but after a while, I was convinced.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nA transformation occurred when the Closners were in the process of recording their first album, Native Dreamer Kin. At the time, they were calling themselves Dearborn, but their producer felt that the name didn\u2019t fit the strength of the music. They went to visit their grandfather Jo, in the eastern Oregon town of Joseph. Allison made a playlist for the trip and called it \u201cJoseph,\u201d which is what influenced the band\u2019s name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cOnce she said it, it just hit us all\u2014that\u2019s what this is and who we are, these are the sounds of the land that we\u2019ve lived on,\u201d says Natalie.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this new sense of themselves, Meegan and Allison began taking a more active role in the group\u2019s songwriting. Meegan notes that while the process was a \u201ctotally new journey\u201d for her, it felt similar to the candor and vulnerability of her long-time journaling\u2014just \u201cpulling out the gold and arranging that into neater lines.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe and Natalie both point to the song \u201cHonest\u201d as a keystone for the development of I\u2019m Alone, No You\u2019re Not. \u201cWe were trying really hard to write a song, but nothing was coming,\u201d recalls Natalie. \u201cOne night, Meegan was working on some lyrics and getting frustrated, so she wrote in the margin of the page, \u2018I can\u2019t say a true thing. It\u2019s hard to be that honest.\u2019 Immediately after that, her most honest sentence spilled out\u2014\u2018There\u2019s always two thoughts, one after the other: I\u2019m alone. No, you\u2019re not.\u2019 And she thought, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s the song.\u2019 \u201c\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the group was cultivating a devoted fan base in the most traditional ways possible: touring the Western states playing living room shows, backyard parties, and secret house party gigs; reaching an audience directly through such platforms as Noisetrade; selling their self-released CD and building a loyal following step by step. By the time they were approached by ATO Records, Joseph had already built a strong community of fans on its own.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they moved toward making their second record, the project took an additional turn when the Closners decided to work with some other songwriters in Los Angeles. \u201cWe were afraid of it at first because the songs were more pop than we were used to writing,\u201d says Meegan, \u201cbut as we internalized them, they started becoming super-important to us.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey point to \u201cMore Alive Than Dead,\u201d co-written with Ethan Gruska, as an example of these contributions. \u201cThat song describes an experience with a partner where you have hard things in your combined past,\u201d says Natalie. \u201cYou\u2019re haunted by them until you realize that those things are dead, and as long as you dwell on them, you\u2019re missing the real live person in front of you.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe adds, though, that Gruska was critical in clarifying and sharpening the nuanced emotion of the lyric. \u201cWhen Ethan sent us back the demo, I lost it, He was able to see the heart of the song and bring it out, cut to the core of what I was trying to say.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the women of Joseph recorded the album with acclaimed producer Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, Jenny Lewis, First Aid Kit) at his studio in Omaha. He was able to open up their expansive, evocative vocal sound with powerful and striking arrangements, adding depth while highlighting their haunting intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThis was our first time doing a recording like this,\u201d says Natalie, \u201cand we learned so much about creativity. Mike is a genius, and he\u2019s just a total maniac as a musician, so he took these bare bones songs and brought them to life with lush, gorgeous textures and sounds.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial reaction to the music on I\u2019m Alone, No You\u2019re Not has been remarkable. Joseph was selected as a #SpotifySpotlight artist, and booked for festivals including Bonnaroo, Pickathon, and Sasquatch even prior to the release of the single \u201cWhite Flag,\u201d a song inspired by an article predicting a massive earthquake for the Pacific Northwest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cReading that created a heaviness that was making us jumpy, scared, and miserable,\u201d says Natalie. \u201cIt became clear we had two options: be scared and cowering, backing away from the world into paralysis, or keep moving and live. Defy fear. Wear peace. Find better ways to love the people in our lives instead of huddling together like frightened sheep thinking about earthquakes.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMost rewarding for the Closner sisters has been feeling the audience response to the new songs, as they tour supporting such artists as James Bay and Amos Lee. \u201cThis is really when you learn what\u2019s special about a song, or if it\u2019s special,\u201d says Natalie. \u201cIt\u2019s this crazy firecracker thing that happens\u2014\u2018Am I feeling something? Is anyone? What is this song, what does it do, which parts make the most sense?\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt really is about connection with people, and we\u2019re so grateful we\u2019ve gotten the chance to do that. This has been a totally wild journey, and we\u2019re constantly blown away with possibility of what could be.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":226},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":226},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":170},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":170},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":113},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":113},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-og.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":226},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":57},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":57},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":226},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":226},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":226},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/89/79-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":226}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3kXDMPwfMc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thebandjoseph.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/thebandjoseph\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/thebandjoseph\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"thebandjoseph\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1772100,\"name\":\"Kelsey Kopecky\",\"startTime\":\"2017-03-01 21:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"\\\"For me it all started in my dad's garage up in Minnesota.
