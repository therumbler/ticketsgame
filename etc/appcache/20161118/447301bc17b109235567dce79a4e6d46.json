He was an original member of the Ultramagnetic MCs, appeared on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon (2015) and is well-known for the classic album \\\"Dr. Octagon\\\" created with friend, Dan The Automator. He's from the Bronx, but belongs to far-reaching astral dimensions and where many of his contemporaries have become legacy acts or revivalists, Keith continues to originate and perfect his wild style. He drinks with MF DOOM in dusty London basement and recruits legendary squadrons of fellow travelers including Sadat X (Brand Nubian), Bumpy Knuckles, Boston pioneer Ed O.G., Slug from Atmosphere, and Vallejo legend Mac Mall to appear on his new album \\\"Feature Magnetic,\\\" released September 16, 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the Album: Feature Magnetic\\r\\nKool Keith's new album \\\"Feature Magnetic,\\\" released Sept. 16 on Mello Music Group, is the latest bizarre transformative hip hop odyssey. In a world filled with Cheesecake rappers, one man, Kool Keith, has assembled a phenomenal team to bring you madness. Critics are calling it sensational. Free association, sci-fi, sextastic, horrorcore, Kool Keith invented it all. His newest excursion into rhyme finds a who's who of rappers holding it down alongside Keith. From Dirt Nasty to Slug, MF Doom to Bumpy Knuckles, Mac Mall to Ras Kass - the best to have ever done it spit hotter fire than even Dylan. Like butterscotch ice cream on your crotch or eating dead bok choy with Soldier Boy, you've got to think about it. Get cozy and sit inside the paragraph. This is \\\"Feature Magnetic\\\" Kool Keith's newest reality breaker.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":576},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":180},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":180},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":120},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":120},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":614},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":60},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":60},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":300},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":300},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":390},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/42/67-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":390}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.koolkeith.co.uk/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/koolkeith\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/officialkoolkeith/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/UltraMan7000\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"UltraMan7000\"},{\"id\":1730893,\"name\":\"DJ Lord\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Dj LORD is a key member of Public Enemy and Prophets of Rage, legendary turntablist and multi-genre Dj.

LORD is one of the most versatile Djs in the game. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Dj battles and Hip Hop are the foundation of his career, LORD is widely recognized for his high-energy shows that seamlessly fuse turntablism with impeccable multi-genre music selection leaving crowds screaming for more.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving mastered the art of Djing, LORD is pursuing his second love, producing. He has produced tracks for Public Enemy and with Dubstep groups TrillBass and HULK\u2014and he's just getting warm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, LORD joined the elite task force Prophets of Rage.
