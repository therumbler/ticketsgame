Those who bring more than this to the table always stand out from the crowd. Hamburg/Berlin duo Kollektiv Turmstrasse (Christian Hilscher and Nico Plagemann) are one of those rare acts whose music caters for both body and soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready performing in clubs with their own solo endeavours - Nico as a live act, Christian as a DJ - the pair met back in 1998 at a party they were both booked for, and immediately struck up a rapport. \u201cThere weren't many music nerds in the region\u201d they recall. \u201cIt was almost inevitable for us to become friends.\u201d Their musical bond deepened swiftly through regular record store pilgrimages and late nights in clubs and at festivals. Swapping music and throwing parties together, they soon made their first joint studio venture in 2000 \u201cwithout really heading into a specific direction. It all began in our first shared apartment in a street called Turmstrasse.\u201d It was their record dealer who proved to be the catalyst for their production career, urging them to bring their music to the world and releasing the track Turmstrasse on his Electronic Parliament imprint in 2001. \u201cWithout him we wouldn't be where we are today. He believed in us and enabled us a lot.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir cinematic take on 4/4 electronica has won praise from all quarters via releases on Diynamic, Connaisseur and their own Musik Gewinnt Freunde imprint. Debut album Rebellion der Tr\u00e4umer (\u2018The Dreamer\u2019s Rebellion\u2019) demonstrated a prowess beyond the realms of the dancefloor, laden with frosty electronic melody, downtempo rhythm and classy vocals. A busy remix schedule has seen them grace the likes of Cocoon, Get Physical, Soma, Poker Flat, Defected, Systematic and Traum, reworking multifarious acts including Trentem\u00f8ller, Hot Chip and Terry Lee Brown Jnr. along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sense of emotion - informed by their upbringing on Germany\u2019s visually arresting Baltic Sea coast - lends their productions a human warmth, allowing them to slot effortlessly into both club and home listening scenarios. \u201cWide; open; top-heavy; all-consuming; shifted; simple; these are the words we use to describe our sound. We use both digital and analog. First and foremost we produce music for ourselves. We don't predetermine whether it\u2019s suited for home or club environment.\u201d This lack of contrition serves them well. Electronic music is an art for them; not a science.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatching their live show reveals how their music connects with crowds on an emotional level, and how its melodic and textural depth works in such synergy with its rhythmic backbone. \u201cWe play live with two MacBooks running Ableton Live with over a thousand clips, which gives us a lot of space to improvise. The whole thing is controlled with one iPad each which allows us to work very fast and intuitively.\u201d Their show has been finding them in high demand across the globe, and has helped them to strengthen their relationship with Solomun\u2019s Diynamic label - playing at their international parties while releasing music with them on a regular basis. \u201cThey have been friends of ours for over ten years\u201d says Solomun. \u201cIt was a mere matter of time for them to join in. Mutual friends, interests and in general a similar perception of music and life brought us together.\u201d While the label\u2019s sound has evolved in recent years, there has always been a place for Kollektiv Turmstrasse within their fabric. \u201cOne thing that we all have in common is a certain melancholy and harmony in our productions.\u201d For a duo who don\u2019t like to be pigeonholed, it\u2019s a perfect fit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe journey has alway been more important to us than the reward\u201d Christian and Nico say on their future with music. \u201cThere is a lot to discover along the way and it might just be that the detour is the more scenic route to the next goal.\u201d With such an organic pulse running through their productions, it should come as no surprise that they hope their career progresses in similarly unforced fashion.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/01-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/kollektivturmstrasse\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1767645,\"name\":\"Stimming\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\\\"I\u00b4m neither afraid of showing my emotions nor to include them in my music\\\"\\r\\nFew people bring a truly original sound to house music. It's all very well making some nice grooves and working the dancefloor, but when it comes to longevity and leaving an indelible mark on the genre and the wider musical sphere, you've got to bring something new to the table. At a relatively young age, Hamburg's Martin Stimming did just that, demonstrating a sophisticated yet accessible sound that's beyond his years. \\\"I want people to see me as an evolving artist, where you never know what exactly you get - but you know that it's Stimming.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe elegance of his productions is rooted in his classical training in his native Germany. Born in Giessen in 1983, he became highly accomplished at the violin, piano and drums by the age of 10, giving him a solid and well-rounded musical education and ability, and an intimate understanding of music theory. His first electronic obsessions took hold when he was 15, discovering the joy of sampled breaks and beats through the likes of DJ Krush and Grooverider, and a year later when living in Butzbach (not far from techno hub Frankfurt) he fell under the spell of DJs like Sven V\u00e4th of Chris Liebing and began hoarding vinyl. It was around this time that he began producing music with a computer \u2013 something he soon realised was his \\\"destiny\\\". \\\"I think if more producers would include their own mind and feelings into their music the whole scene would be much more flavoured and diverse which would be good for all of us\u2026at least in an entertaining way.\\\"  \\r\\n\\r\\nWith his future path clearly in mind, Stimming moved to Hamburg aged 19 and enrolled in an Electronic Music Production course at the SAE Institute, followed by a studio internship. By 2006 he was producing bubbly deeper techno as one half of Gebr\u00fcder Ton, and around this time he met two guys named Solomun and Adriano, who shared a similar take and viewpoint on house and techno music. These two new acquaintances set up their label Diynamic Music in the same year, and soon Stimming was producing and releasing music and collaborations on the nascent imprint, building himself the musical family that he had longed for \u2013 and launching his solo career under his own surname in 2007. His breakthrough hit, 2008's Una Pena, made the electronic world sit up and take notice, and before long acclaimed labels like Freerange, liebe*detail, Buzzin' Fly, Green and Poker Flat were snapping up his work. 2009 saw him release his immaculate debut album Reflections to great acclaim, cementing his reputation as one of the most exciting new producers of his generation. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Probably every track normally has at least one sound that is completely out of context, but tweaked and smashed in a way that it fits.\\\" Amidst a sea of mediocre similarity in dance music, Martin Stimming's work stands out as truly different. His productions are filled with a multitude of his own unique, charismatic field recordings, and he never uses the same sample more than once. Nothing is sacred; sources of sound in his productions have included a Coke can, a coffee machine, children's toys, keys, marbles, a rubbish bin, loose change, tube train breaking systems and doors and an Ikea pizza cutter. His intricate beats and rhythm are testament to his long-running drumming skills \u2013 which in recent years saw him play live drum kit beats on top of frenetic drum and bass DJ sets in German clubs \u2013 and his music conveys a strong range of emotions within the limitations of deeper house and techno music. \\\"You just can't get that type of material out of a synthesizer. And I'm also able to, in a way, morph the listener into the atmosphere I had when I recorded it. And depending on how much I tweak it afterwards it can be a very natural 'on this earth' kind of feeling, or the exact opposite.\\\"  \\r\\n\\r\\nBut it's not all about 4/4 kicks and dancefloor mentality; as his stunning second album Liquorice demonstrates. Produced with pleasing no-one but himself in mind, it eschews the normal kick-clap/snare template by and large to explore more interesting and progressive territories, but always with that trademark magpie-like sense of texture, emotion and discovery. It's an album to expand his remit beyond the constraints of the dancefloor and into the wider realms of beautiful electronic music. \\\"I called it Liquorice because I simply love real liquorice sweets, and I have realised that it's something someone loves or hates. There's not much middle ground, and there were probably 50% who like it and the others don't.\\\"  2010 saw him pick up an award for Best Newcomer at the Ibiza DJ Awards, following on from his live show (Stimming doesn't DJ) stunning the crowds at the island's legendary Pacha, and the finest danceries around the world \u2013 from Berlin's Panorama bar to Sao Paulo's D-Edge, Brussels' Fuse, London's Fabric and Paris' Rex, and plenty more beyond. Remixes for the likes of Sascha Funke, Claude VonStroke, Marc Romboy and Stephan Bodzin and Robert Babicz to name but a few have further spread his influence amongst the discerning house and tech community, and cemented his reputation as one of the scene's most exceptional producers. Clearly, Martin Stimming is a precious talent indeed.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":908,\"height\":620},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":205},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":137},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-og.jpg\",\"width\":908,\"height\":620},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":68},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":341},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":444},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/19/03-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/stimming\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1683205,\"name\":\"DJ M3\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"DJ M3 aka Manny is a major influence in SF's music scene.
