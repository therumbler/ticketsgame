their third studio album Sir Nebula, TAUK tap into their singular chemistry to elevate and expand their all-instrumental blend of funk, hip-hop, progressive rock, and jazz. Revealing both their refined musicality and unbridled creativity, the Oyster Bay, New York-bred rock-fusion four-piece (guitarist Matt Jalbert, bassist Charlie Dolan, keyboardist/organist Alric \\\"A.C.\\\" Carter, and drummer Isaac Teel) push into new sonic terrain and build entire worlds within each richly textured soundscape.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the hazy atmospherics of \\\"Time's Up\\\" and soaring riffs of \\\"Program Select\\\" to the urgent rhythms of \\\"Shenanigans\\\" and sprawling melodies of \\\"Where You Are,\\\" Sir Nebula finds TAUK introducing a cosmically inspired element to their music. \\\"The album ended up taking on a more ambient kind of vibe than anything we've done before\u2014there's a spaciness in the songs that lets you get lost in the sound,\\\" says Dolan. And while the album is endlessly hypnotic, TAUK also deliver the dynamic tension-and-release jams that have helped earn them a devoted following while drawing critical acclaim (the Washington Post, for one, praised TAUK for \\\"creating a hard-charging, often melodic fusion that\u2014thanks to a penchant for improv\u2014offers limitless possibilities\\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout Sir Nebula\u2014the follow-up to their 2015 live double album HEADROOM\u2014TAUK allow a more free-form, instinct-guided approach to steer their music into bold new directions. \\\"With this record, we felt more comfortable in the studio and got to a new level where we were able to constantly feed off each other, so there was a lot of spur-of-the-moment improvisation that really helped shape the album,\\\" says Jalbert. Adds Carter: \\\"We made a point of trying to express ourselves freely and take risks even when that felt challenging and scary, instead of holding ourselves back and possibly taking something away from the songs.\\\" At the same time, TAUK sharpened their songwriting to craft more intricately layered arrangements and powerfully intense grooves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with their past four releases, TAUK created Sir Nebula in collaboration with Grammy Award-winning producer/mixer/engineer Robert Carranza (The Mars Volta, Ozomatli, Jack Johnson, Taj Mahal). But in a departure from their previous work, the band made the album in one concentrated period rather than spacing the recording sessions out in between tours. Holing up at the Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles, often pulling 12-hour workdays, TAUK ultimately found the revamped recording process hugely beneficial. \\\"Everything just happened so naturally this time around,\\\" says Jalbert. \\\"I can't think of one moment where it felt like anything was forced. We were all just completely focused and in the same mindset, which made it this incredibly fun and smooth experience.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTAUK's creative connection traces back to childhood, when longtime friends Dolan, Jalbert, and Carter formed their first band in seventh grade and held practice in their school basement. After playing together in various projects over the years, the trio brought Teel into the fold in 2012, cementing the final lineup. \\\"We gelled pretty quickly as friends and as musicians, and now there's a connection onstage that's unspoken,\\\" notes Teel. \\\"You just feel it from the energy within the band and from the response coming from the crowd\u2014all these people in the same exact headspace.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSince their formation, TAUK have shared stages with an impressive list of bands (including Widespread Panic, Umphrey's McGee, Lettuce, and Tim Reynolds & TR3), in addition to appearing at festivals like Electric Forest, Bonnaroo, and The Allman Brothers' Peach Music Festival. That rigorous touring schedule has gone a long way in strengthening their chemistry, according to Carter. \\\"We're doing 140 shows a year and we pretty much live with each other, so there's a healthy respect and trust and love happening there,\\\" he says. \\\"We all have a common goal and an understanding that this is something we're compelled to do, and that's definitely brought us close together.\\\" It's also helped TAUK develop a reputation as a masterful live act: \\\"TAUK is unstoppable,\\\" raved Live for Live Music. \\\"If you haven't see them, dear God, go.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow on the road again (with upcoming dates including a two-night stint at the Brooklyn Bowl and spots on the Hangtown Music Festival, North Coast Music Festival, and Catskill Chill Music Festival), TAUK also have plans to widen their output by composing scores for film and television. In the meantime, the band is focused on instilling their live show with the same kinetic energy and boundless passion that powered the making of Sir Nebula. \\\"Growing up together as musicians and collectively going on this journey\u2014that's what makes this experience really special,\\\" says Jalbert of TAUK's continued evolution. \\\"It's like everything we've learned over the years has been funneled into this band, and now it's taking shape in a really exciting way. We all love what we're doing, and the band just feels like home.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-og.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":853},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/41/17-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.taukband.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/tauk\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/taukband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/taukband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"taukband\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1740603,\"name\":\"Voodoo Visionary\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Voodoo Visionary hails from the dirty south musical mecca of Atlanta.

TOC recorded their debut album, Time to Go with Grammy nominated producer John Keane (REM, Widespread Panic) which was released June 19th, 2015. In July 2015, the Orange Constant moved to Athens to engage with the scene and build their following. Time to Go has garnered praise from many publications, including Relix Magazine, who included TOC in their \\\"On the Verge\\\" column in the October-November 2015 issue. Shortly after, TOC joined the Homegrown Music Network whose roster includes acts such as Lotus, the Motet, Dangermuffin, and Big Something. In addition, they have played on bills that include Perpetual Groove, New Orleans Suspects, Atlas Road Crew, and Yo Mama's Big Fat Booty Band. TOC won the 2016 Athens Music Award for best \\\"Jam/ Funk\\\".\\n\\nThe Orange Constant draws influence from many different styles to create a musical experience that is new and unique. The Orange Constant thrives on creating songs that differ from one another and possess their own inspired character. Fans are often drawn to their ability to meld progressive composition and improvisation with a pop-like sensibility. The band consists of Andrew Brantley (guitar/vocal/keyboard), Lee Guentert (drums), Nickalous Benson (guitar/vocal), and Tyler Walker (bass/vocal).\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.theorangeconstant.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/theorangeconstant\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/orangeconstant\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"orangeconstant\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://variety-playhouse.com/event/1281545?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
