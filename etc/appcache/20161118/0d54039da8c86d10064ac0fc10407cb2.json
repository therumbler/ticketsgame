Running with the torch that has passed on by his influences (which range from Timbaland & The Neptunes to Danger Mouse & The Gorillaz), Blue has always felt like his time is now as the music industries next innovative producer-artist combo.\\n\\nBlue is well known for his extensive production work with national hip hop artist such as, Kendrick Lamar (P&P, P&P 1.5, & Faith), Mac Miller (Down The Rabbit Hole), Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, & Dorrough Music. And he's also praised as one of Dallas' best producers based off the work he put together as half of the groundbreaking duo known as Sore Losers in '09-'10 (Free Loaders, Get A Life).\\n\\nAs a producer, Blue prides himself on evolving and progressing as a musician. Though most of his success is in the Hip-Hop genre, he has an everlasting love for adding all forms of music into his own, especially those of the electronic nature. You can easily hear a trance arranged synthesizer here, an alternative rock sequence there, Texas \\\"screw\\\" style vocals in the backgrounds, and dub step wobble baselines behind it all. He simply calls his approach \\\"experimental\\\", because he won't limit himself to toying around with one genre. \\n\\nAs an artist, Blue takes a different approach to rap than your average hip-hop artist. He looks at rap as a form of self expression to share his artistic side which takes you on a journey with well thought out concepts and stories of his life experiences rather than to \\\"out rap\\\" everyone in the industry with metaphors and punch-lines.\\n\\nLooking to expose this new sound to a larger audience, Blue released an EP entitled \\\"Numb.\\\" at the end of 2011 and it was well received amongst the public. Numb. held a huge internet presence on Hip Hop blogs (2DopeBoyz, OnSmash, Pigeons & Planes, Sneak Hype, & More), proving that there is a lane for something as unique and different as Blue's vision.\\n\\nBlue plans to continue this success into 2012. He promises that this is the year that he really bounces into the national spotlight as both a trendsetter in sound and as a provocative lyricist.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/BlueTheMisfit\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1749955,\"name\":\"Sudie\",\"startTime\":\"2016-11-12 21:40:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"Merging classical training with a unique DIY recording process, Sudie is an artist who's truly forging her own territory.\\n\\nThe 22-year-old singer, songwriter and musician, describes her sound as \\\"something jazzy meets kind of crazy\u2026 if Bjork had arranged something for Ella Fitzgerald or Billie Holiday to sing over.\\\" It's a sound she's crafted all by herself, utilizing a pair of keyboards, a cheap microphone and a MacBook inside the confines of her tiny bathroom in Dallas, TX.\\n\\nEvery true artist takes their own journey to finding their voice, and for Sudie that path took her from Texas to Dubai and back.  Born in Florida, she moved all over the U.S. as a kid, including stops in Dallas and Atlanta, on account of her dad's job as a pilot.
