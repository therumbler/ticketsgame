You have to go to America\u2019s roots.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it came time for the band to record their latest full-length album Up, On & Over, they found themselves in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains on a farm in the tiny town of Louisa, Virginia. In their journey as a band, recording in different parts of the United States has opened up their ears and minds. \u201cWe find it\u2019s easier to get into a creative zone when we\u2019re outside of our element,\u201d lead singer and guitarist Chris Henderson explains, \u201cwe were surrounded by goats, chickens, and farmland.\u201d The trek south this year was just the latest venture for Bronze Radio Return (Henderson, drummer Rob Griffith, lead guitarist Patrick Fetkowitz, keys player Matthew Warner, bassist Bob Tannen, and harmonica/banjoist extraordinaire Craig Struble) who are no strangers to recording in new \u2013 and sometimes remote \u2013 places.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir story starts in Hartford, where members orbited each other at The Hartt School, one of the country\u2019s top music conservatories. After finding each other and solidifying their line-up in 2008, they began writing music and found that their surroundings played a huge part in their creative energies. While writing their debut album Old Time Speaker, they bounced between the buzzing urban community in Hartford, where Henderson says melodies and chord progressions come naturally, and a remote Maine town, where they holed up to focus on lyrics. When they went into the studio in 2009, they went, as Henderson says, to \u201ca place we\u2019d never been before with a producer we\u2019d never met to play a bunch of songs we\u2019d never played before.\u201d The producer was Chad Copelin (Ivan & Alyosha, Ben Rector), who would go on to form a solid and lasting partnership with the band.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years later, Copelin brought the band to his home turf in Norman, Oklahoma to record their follow-up album Shake! Shake! Shake! The small community lived and breathed music. The Midwestern neighborliness and kindness shined through on the album \u2013 drenched in harmony, warmth, and soul, the songs were made to make people come together. Sing-alongs, foot stomps, hand claps, and all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was during this time that the band began to get picked up for numerous TV spots and ads. Shake! Shake! Shake! produced over 50 syncs in the past year-and-a-half when all was tolled. Highlights include a worldwide Nissan Leaf commercial and a national Behr Paint/Home Depot ad. In addition, HBO, ESPN, NBC, MTV, the CW, American Idol, ABC Family, USA, and more licensed their music for shows, promos and bumpers. Instead of waiting for the syncs to break them out, Bronze Radio Return threw themselves into a rigorous touring schedule. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really fortunate to have our music used in a lot of TV and film, and also made some real traction at radio. But this band is first and foremost a live band,\u201d says Henderson. The band has spent the better part of the last two years playing every corner of the US and winning fans over with their packed-with-energy live show.\\r\\nCut back to 2013 and find Bronze Radio Return back in Virginia with Copelin at their side recording Up, On & Over, the band\u2019s most ambitious release to date. \u201cYou can hear there\u2019s an obvious progression with this batch of songs. It\u2019s very much still a Bronze Radio Return record but we really found ourselves getting into a groove during the recording process which allowed us as a band to dig deeper into the material than ever before,\u201d says Warner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album is a collection of songs defined by the band\u2019s ability to step out of their comfort zone and push forward. Leading the way is first single \u201cFurther On,\u201d an optimistic anthem steeped in summertime brightness. \u201cFurther On\u201d started making waves months before the album\u2019s anticipated release, when it was tapped as the soundtrack to the PGA Tour\u2019s national ad campaign featuring Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. The rest of the record follows suit with strong hooks, twangy guitars, and driving percussion. While we can\u2019t be sure where Bronze Radio Return\u2019s story will take them next, Up, On & Over is an exciting new chapter in their journey. Keep an eye out as their story unfolds, taking us all for a ride moving... well\u2026 Further On.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/64/86/51-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"KSw6CVvhRck\",\"title\":\"Bronze Radio Return - Shake, Shake, Shake (Official Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KSw6CVvhRck\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"i4lynO5FNkI\",\"title\":\"Bronze Radio Return - Further On\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i4lynO5FNkI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"5GsorW2-uF8\",\"title\":\"Bronze Radio Return \\\"Down There\\\" (Official Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GsorW2-uF8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KSw6CVvhRck\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bronzeradioreturn.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/bronzeradioreturn\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/bronzeradioreturn\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/BronzeRadio\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"BronzeRadio\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1772414,\"name\":\"Air Traffic Controller\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Air Traffic Controller have created a place all their own in the indie pop world.\\r\\n \\r\\nServing in the US Navy as an air traffic controller, singer/songwriter Dave Munro sent home demos written during deployment.  Band-mate and singer/songwriter Casey Sullivan met Dave soon thereafter, and the two forged a collaborative bond that has become the vocal sound of ATC.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an eclectic song catalog and category-defying organic/electronic sound, people are taking notice of ATC.  Theywere 2015 Billboard Hot 100 Fest performers with The Weeknd and Justin Bieber, placed on the NPR Hot 100 List for SXSW, named Guardian UK Band of the Day, won Best Indie Alternative Song for \\\"You Know Me\\\" in the Independent Music Awards, and have over 15 million Spotify plays.

Vanyaland in Boston calls BLACK BOX an evolution forward featuring \\\"crafty alt-pop, an expansion of depth and sound, catchy hooks,\\\" and describes the song \\\"Warrior\\\" as \\\"a pleasantly brooding, mystic-pop thumper.\\\" One Stop Record Shop in the UK states \\\"the album is equal parts fascinating and brilliant\\\" while \\\"combining flecks of CHVRCHES with the indie vibes of Pulp and a smattering of Death Cab For Cutie.\\\"  \\r\\n\\r\\nSongs from BLACK BOX have been featured by Gary Vaynerchuk in the Daily Vee, EA Sports NHL 17, the UK's top reality show Made In Chelsea.
