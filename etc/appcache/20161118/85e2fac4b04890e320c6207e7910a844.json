Young Band\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Somewhere in the midst of 10,000 towns, along a lonely highway between packing clubs in their native Texas years ago and more recently performing stadiums on one of country music\u2019s hottest tours, the Eli Young Band became more than a band. They became a brotherhood. Camaraderie and creativity fused into an intoxicating cocktail that has propelled the talented foursome to the vanguard of contemporary country music.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith three No. 1 hits under their belt as well as a Grammy nomination and an Academy of Country Music Award for Song of the Year for their hit \u201cCrazy Girl,\u201d the Eli Young Band approached their second Republic Nashville album, 10,000 Towns, with a sense of confidence and purpose. \u201cWe were genuinely excited about making this new record,\u201d says bassist Jon Jones. \u201cPeople talk about the sophomore record being really tough to make and in a lot of ways this felt like our sophomore record even though it\u2019s technically our fifth record as a band.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe learned over the progression of those records our strong points in the studio, and we were confident,\u201d adds drummer Chris Thompson, \u201cWe knew what we wanted and how to get what we wanted.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s been a long, steady rise for Jones, Thompson, lead vocalist Mike Eli and guitarist James Young, but the same four musicians have been together from the start and are now reaping the rewards. They began performing together in 2000 while attending North Texas State University, and honed their skills on the Lone Star state\u2019s competitive music circuit by building a rabid fan base who appreciated their potent live shows and the edgy, passionate indie albums that preceded their major label ascension.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the 2011 release of their Republic Nashville debut, Life at Best, the Eli Young Band scored their first No. 1 hit with \u201cCrazy Girl.\u201d The double platinum single became the # 1 most played country song of the year on Billboard\u2019s 2011 year end chart and earned them the ACM Award for Song of the Year. The band\u2019s next single, \u201cEven If It Breaks Your Heart,\u201d became their second No. 1 and was certified platinum. It earned the band Grammy nods for Best Duo/Group Performance and for Best Country Song as well as Single of the Year and Song of the Year nominations from both the CMA and ACM.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter years of paying dues and gaining experience, the Eli Young Band is at the top of their game. While they started playing in tiny clubs, they\u2019ve graduated to packing out theatres and mid-size venues as a headliner. Their road dog reputation helped them to earn an opening slot playing stadiums on the Kenny Chesney tour. All those miles on the road and visits to 10,000 towns coalesce to make their new album the band\u2019s strongest effort yet. \u201cAt this point in our personal lives and in our career, we\u2019re all in really good places,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cWe\u2019re all happy in our personal lives, so it shows on this record; it\u2019s fun.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThis record was a lot more upbeat than our previous records,\u201d agrees Young. \u201cWe really wanted to record songs that are going to be fun to play live and fun for our fans watching the show. We were thinking about our live show and how these songs are going to translate on the set list. That was a priority in our minds too when we chose songs for this record. We\u2019ve also learned to really follow our gut when it comes to songs and song choices. We\u2019ve always had a good sense of what songs are going to work on the record and which ones aren\u2019t.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir meticulous approach to writing and finding the very best songs for the new album paid off quickly as the lead single, \u201cDrunk Last Night,\u201d became the band\u2019s third No. 1 hit. \u201cWe loved that song from the first 30 seconds of hearing it,\u201d Eli says of the Josh Osborne/Laura Veltz penned song. \u201cWith that title, you read it and you think it\u2019s going to be a certain type of song and then you hear the song and it\u2019s not what you thought it would be at all. The songwriters, Josh and Laura, did a really good job of messing with our brains. People were drawn to the idea that it\u2019s not the same ole same ole drinking song. That was intriguing. They did well, hitting you with two hooky choruses, that\u2019s a tricky thing to write. That\u2019s what drew me as a singer to the song.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recording 10,000 Towns, the Eli Young Band gathered songs from Music Row\u2019s top writers, including Craig Wiseman, David Lee Murphy, Jon Randall and Will Hoge, and the band also penned half the songs on the album themselves. \u201cIt gets challenging when you\u2019re touring so much to sit down and actually try to write, but we spent a lot of time in 2013 just trying to write however we could,\u201d says Young. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt was fun for us because the four of us all sat down and wrote for this record which was a great experience,\u201d says Eli. \u201cAll four of us are on \u2018Prayer For The Road,\u2019 \u2018Traces\u2019 and \u2018Revelations.\u2019 John and James were co-writers on \u2018Dust\u2019 while I was co-writer on \u2018Angel Like You.\u2019 \u2018What Does\u2019 was John, James and I and \u2018Last Broken Heart\u2019 was the same. We\u2019ve never had a song on a record where all four of us were songwriters until this album.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second single, \u201cDust,\u201d was the #1 most added song on the chart the first week with a massive 62 stations on board. The song is a rock-tinged number about a girl leaving small town life behind and taking charge of her future. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve read so much recently about the girls being seen as weak in country music in the way that they are portrayed,\u201d says Jones. \u201cI really love this song because I call it \u2018a big girl power song.\u2019 All four of us are married to very strong women who allow us to go out and do what we do and we couldn\u2019t do it without them.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10,000 Towns, the Eli Young Band delivers a diverse collection of songs that explores the complexities of relationships such as the bluesy cheating song \u201cRevelations\u201d and the heartbreaking \u201cWhat Does,\u201d a poignant examination of a failed relationship. Yet there are several tunes that just revel in the simple pleasures that bring joy to the journey, among them \u201cJust Add Moonlight\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s Do Something Tonight.\u201d \u201cA Prayer for the Road\u201d is a tender tribute to the love of their families and the prayerful support that goes with them every mile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been many miles over the years for the Eli Young Band and that\u2019s why 10,000 Towns felt like the right title for their new effort. \u201cThere\u2019s a general theme between small town America where every town is different, but in some ways, they are the same,\u201d says Young. \u201cWe felt like the title encapsulated the best years of us driving all over the country playing music.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nEli agrees. \u201cWe\u2019ve traveled all over the country and to other countries, but at the end of the day we all party the same way no matter what the culture or the town,\u201d he says. \u201cTo us, \u201810,000 Towns\u2019 is a great way to sum up this record in that way as well as who we are. We love traveling around the country and seeing all that and being a band of road dogs.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eli Young Band has worked hard to get to this point and is enjoying their current success the same way they earned it---TOGETHER. \u201cWe\u2019ve surpassed the friend mark now and it\u2019s more like brothers. It\u2019s really kind of a blood bond between the four of us,\u201d Jones says. \u201cWe set out to do this as a career and made the commitment to each other a long time ago and here we are 14 years later. None of us can imagine doing anything else.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":800,\"height\":800},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-og.jpg\",\"width\":800,\"height\":800},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/49/39-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://stampedehouston.ticketfly.com/event/1343367?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
