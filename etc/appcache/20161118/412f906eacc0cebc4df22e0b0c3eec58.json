BRIGHTS\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"On a frigid January morning, Seattle quintet Smokey Brights packed every piece of gear they owned into a van and set up a recording studio in a massive barn on a Christmas tree farm in rural Carnation, WA. With the help of Cameron Spies and Elisabeth Ellison from Portland band Radiation City, the band filled their drafty, spooky studio with the sounds of what was to be their debut full length record, \\\"Taste for Blood.\\\" After nine chilly days, stopping only to eat and sleep in a lofted apartment area above the barn, the crew emerged with an enigmatic and complex record.  Rooted in 70's rock, the band traced surprising lines between new wave, folk, shoe gaze, Memphis soul, psychedelia, and blue color rock and roll. \\\"Taste For Blood\\\" hearkens back to a time when records were less of a collection of attempted singles, and more of holistic emotional journey, a lush landscape to get lost in.\\n\\nThe recording session started off what was to be a huge year for the group. In summer, singer/ guitarist Ryan Devlin and vocalist/ keyboardist Kim West got married, with the rest of the band in the wedding line. The band also brought their AM-pop-magic to a number of the Northwest's biggest festivals, including Timber! and Bumbershoot. Shortly thereafter, Smokey Brights released \\\"Taste for Blood\\\" to a resoundingly warm reception. The album \u2013 self-recorded, self-released, and entirely self-funded (no Kickstarter, no record deal, and no trust fund) \u2013 wound up on a number of \\\"best of\\\" lists, including that of DJs Marco Collins, Milo Miles, and Kevin Cole, and earned the band a spot in near constant rotation on KEXP.  The record release show at Seattle's Tractor Tavern sold out before the doors even opened.\\n\\nDespite these successes, the band remains as they have been since their beginnings in 2011: best friends. Bassist Jim Vermillion and drummer Nick Krivchenia have been hard forged brothers in rhythm for over a decade, having met studying audio engineering at Evergreen State. The two have been in bands ever since, including their experimental bass-loop duo Armed With Legs. Lead guitarist Mike Kalnoky and songwriter Ryan Devlin met playing in Seattle punk bands in the mid aughts, where Kalnoky's melodic and textural playing first caught Devlin's ear. Devlin and keyboardist Kim West have been playing music together at home for years and are delighted that their naturally harmonizing voices are reaching greater audiences.  Through the countless hours of collaboration that has forged the band, the members have become even closer as friends. If Smokey Brights appear to be having a better time than anyone else in the room, it's because they probably are.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.smokeybrights.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/smokeybrights\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/SmokeyBrights\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"SmokeyBrights\"},{\"id\":1759963,\"name\":\"Gazebos\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Call it fate, call it fortune, call it the all-wise guiding-goddess Hand of Rock 'n' Roll, because any way you cut it, Gazebos was meant to be. Ever since the motley quartet of Seattle music-scene lifers came together in 2014, Gazebos has been a shining beacon of the city's live-music landscape, their performances raucous and cathartic and hilarious, uniting the tribes under a banner of unabashed and unabridged fun. Now\u2014finally!\u2014Gazebos have an album out, their debut for Hardly Art Records, and nobody will be surprised that Die Alone is not the existential bummer the title suggests. Gazebos rages against the forces of post-millennial, pre-midlife anxiety and Die Alone is the soundtrack.\\n\\nWhich isn't to say it's a church picnic: Die Alone is more complex than simple genre tags or clich\u00e9d descriptors allow. The band coined the phrase \\\"whoa-pop\\\" to describe their music and they say they're not mad at the term \\\"prog-punk.\\\" Also consider that the album includes a cover from the Grease soundtrack that'll thrill the indie-rock theater-nerd contingent, such as it is. Chalk up the sonic free-for-all to each member's long and eclectic legacy of creative endeavors. None of these people has ever sat still very long.\\n\\nSinger Shannon Perry has been in bands all her life (including Butts and Katherine Hepburn's Voice), and is one of the Northwest's most sought-after tattoo artists. Guitarist TV Coahran runs the weirdest karaoke night in Seattle, named after his record label GGNZLA, and for the past few years has toured, performed, and collaborated with lo-fi legend R. Stevie Moore. Shane Herrell played guitar with critical darlings the First Times, then switched to bass for Gazebos and Bread & Butter, his good-times choogle-rock band. Drummer Jordan T. Adams, typically shirtless by song two at Gazebos shows, comes from cult-fave bands Spurm and Monarchies. They're all well-seasoned performers, they've all orbited each other's bands in and out of Seattle for close to 20 years, and they're all Cancers (except Shane: Capricorn).\\n\\nGiven the band's collision of interests, Die Alone's manic diversity makes perfect sense. These songs are patchworks of parts conceived individually as demos and woven together collectively during sessions in Coahran's basement\u2014which is also where the album was recorded on 8-track with Seattle garage-rock guru Kurt Bloch as engineer. No song sounds like another and yet the album sustains a dizzying, alluring vibe.\\n\\nIt hits you right from the start: Is that Perry singing backwards on opener \\\"Just Get High\\\"? Her vocal delivery is bewitchingly unpredictable, the band stretching the song around her like bubblegum. \\\"I Don't Wanna Be Here\\\" is the album's punchiest track, clocking in at two minutes thirty seconds, Perry venting some serious girl-power angst; dig the woozy flange on Coahran's guitar throughout. Perry further philosophizes on \\\"Sauna\\\" and \\\"Blend,\\\" swerving between her brassy mezzo-soprano and an intense speak-sing mode. \\\"Ere Specka\\\" is a nonsense phrase of Perry's own devising but, with her vocals buoyed by Coahran's, the hiccupy chorus makes its meaning clear. In Grease, Rizzo the proto-feminist Pink Lady sang \\\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\\\" with an empowered elegance that presaged Gazebos' smoldering update (and yes, that's a Rizzo tat on Perry's neck).\\n\\nIf Gazebos has a mission statement, it comes in album closer \\\"Boys I Like.\\\" On the surface it's a song of unrequited romance, but deeper down it's about living and loving every moment to the fullest. Perry sings, \\\"I'm dying right now/you're dying right now/every single one of us is dying/together alone right now.\\\" Yeah, we're all gonna die\u2014it's the one fate nobody escapes. We're all gonna Die Alone, and like Perry sings, that's fine. Somehow, coming from Gazebos, that news doesn't sound so bad.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/gazebos-1\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/gazebosband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ggazebos\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ggazebos\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1371281?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
