Ballroom Thieves\",\"startTime\":\"2016-12-03 23:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"In this increasingly virtual world of ours, what makes music authentic? For some, songs are no more than tiny sentimental decompressions. But others treat music as an extension of their roots, a mirror of their travels and relationships, and a testament to both their craft and passion.\\r\\nFor The Ballroom Thieves, the band\u2019s journey has only just begun, but their roots already run quite deep. Now, on A Wolf in the Doorway the Thieves find themselves taking the very idea of \u201croots\u201d and creating ways to make its associated sound progress, while making its encompassing spirit glow.\\r\\n\\tStylistically, the trio finds a captivating m\u00e9lange of acoustic styles, blending folk conventions with modern hymnals, delta blues grit with rich harmonies, exploring the basic constructions of pop music while almost wholeheartedly rejecting its restrictions at the same time. \\r\\n\\t\u201cOur own personal growth and explorations in songwriting and musicianship caused us to end up in this unique spot where we can generally feel free to be who we are at all times, which is sadly not a luxury enjoyed by all,\u201d says guitarist Martin Earley. \u201cI think we have a certain sound at the moment, but that sound is constantly evolving, and I hope it keeps doing that.\u201d\\r\\n\\tPerhaps it is a blessing, but the band has a certain awareness and interest in all of its surroundings that equates to a form of musical intelligence. See them live and this becomes tremendously clear. They are a product of their community. They wager it all with every song and every performance. They study those with whom they share the stage. They feed off of the spirit of their audience. They grow from each other.  \\r\\n\\t\u201cThis was a huge transition year for us in that regard and I think we are stronger than ever,\u201d says percussionist Devin Mauch. \u201cWhen money is tough, the road is snow covered, ticket sales aren't ideal, food is repetitive, or relationships back home are struggling, that's when you have to be able to turn to your two bandmates and relate to one another on a higher level than others can really understand. We've become a pretty solid and supportive unit, so I think we've armed ourselves to take on just about anything.\u201d\\r\\n\\tA year of transition it was, but with new challenges came fresh inspiration. Cellist Calin Peters joined the band in September of 2013, after Mauch and Earley had been playing with a different cellist for almost two years. Peters\u2019 immersion into the Thieves was almost freakishly natural, with the band soon after discovering ways to add additional brawn to their sound. For Earley, this meant falling slightly in love with an old Gretsch hollow body and spending countless hours studying its sound, experimenting with different ways to make it sing. For Peters, transitioning into a vocalist was a baptism by fire, but as a performer, the ultimate growing experience. \\r\\n\\t\u201cI was terrified to try singing lead, although I always loved creating harmonies,\u201d she says. \u201cFor a while, even knowing I'd have to sing alone into a mic during soundcheck sent me into a day long panic about that one short, unimportant moment. But the most frustrating and challenging times for this band are also the most rewarding.\u201d\\r\\n\\tThe band is now equipped with twelve new originals that make up their first full-length album, A Wolf in the Doorway. The work as a whole reflects the new dynamic, and the excitement that managed to pull all of these songs together in a matter of months. \\r\\n\\tHarmonies take shotgun on the record, lending splendid crescendos to songs like \u201cSaint Monica\u201d and \u201cLantern,\u201d raising them from a rather subdued nature and enriching their lyrical sentiments. Peters\u2019 lead vocals on \u201cBury Me Smiling\u201d are a standout on the album, stirring in fragile melodies and a change of pace to the record. Earley\u2019s lead vocals at times climax to throaty wails on more gravelly tunes like \u201cOars to the Sea\u201d or the final track, \u201cWolf.\u201d And the backbone for such experimentation comes from the distinct percussion work of Mauch, who continually seeks to expand the repertoire of sounds from what little of a setup he brings on the road.\\r\\n\\t\u201cIt bears mentioning that Dev invented his particular style of drumming in his college days and, just as you might expect, that kind of thing comes with somewhat of a learning curve,\u201d says Thieves co-founder Earley. \u201cHe's constantly exploring the limits of what he can do with his setup and adding to it in the process, and that creative energy definitely contributed to the path we're on.\u201d\\r\\n\\tIt brings to mind the early days of The Ballroom Thieves, which really weren\u2019t all that long ago. Limited to just a dorm room, an acoustic guitar, and a djembe, Earley and Mauch first began making music together in 2010 while attending college just south of Boston. The minimalism of these early jam sessions continues to permeate in the purity of the band\u2019s recent music, while songwriting has only grown in complexity. \\r\\n\\tBut the content of these songs isn\u2019t just a product of \u201cpractice makes perfect.\u201d All three of the Thieves are quick to point out that the foundation of their latest work is a reflection of their travels, their interactions, and their time on the road. The band has shared the stage with bands like The Lone Bellow, Houndmouth, and fellow New Englanders Dispatch over the last couple of years. Playing in front of six and playing in front of six hundred both happen with regularity, presenting their own sets of challenges and rewards. Of course, one of the greatest takeaways is the shared experience with any audience, and the creative fuel that it continues to produce.\\r\\n\\t\u201cThe experiences we have with friends, fans, and strangers when we perform is what keeps me wanting to explore this art form further and discover all that it has to offer,\u201d says Earley. \u201cSimple human connection is a beautiful thing and I'm very grateful to be playing music that allows me to experience such feelings on a regular basis.\u201d\\r\\n\\tFor The Ballroom Thieves, this family tree has only just begun to bloom, but its roots give the trio a strong and solid structure from which to continue to build. A Wolf in the Doorway documents this growth in the most authentic way, sending any listener off with a heavier heart and a purer soul than when they arrived.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":654},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":205},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":136},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1396},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":68},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":341},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":443},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/30/81-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.ballroomthieves.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/ballroomthieves\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ballroomthieves\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ballroomthieves\"},{\"id\":1604201,\"name\":\"Paper Bird\",\"startTime\":\"2016-12-03 22:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"For Paper  Bird, their  new album  marks a milestone. More  importantly,  it provides them  with  a  new  beginning,  a  new  chapter  in  their  trajectory  that  sees  them redefining  their  direction,  a  change  in  their  musical  sensibility  while  maintaining their trademark upbeat attitude. The  band\u2019 s  self  titled  album,  available  September  9th  on  Thirty  Tigers  Records/ Sons  of  Thunder  Records,  introduces  vocalist  Carleigh  Aikins  to  the  line-up, whose  previous credits  include extended stints with the critically acclaimed bands Bahamas and Fox Jaws. Her addition to the band adds an extra edge, highlighting a clear sonic evolution. A shift in the band\u2019 s line-up has opened up new possibilities, swapping  electric  guitars  and  amped  up  instrumentation  for  the  laid  back,  folk-flavored sound they favored in the past. \u201cIn  truth  this  is  an  entirely  new  band,\u201d  bassist  Caleb  Summeril  explains. \u201cWith Carleigh coming on board, we\u2019 ve literally made a fresh start.\u201dGuitarist  Paul  DeHaven  first  met  Aikins  at  a  concert  on  Willie  Nelson\u2019 s  ranch during South by Southwest in 2012. The two hit it off, and before long Aikins and the   rest   of   the   band   began   collaborating   long   distance   via   email. \u201cIt   was serendipitous  that  we  could  join  forces  so  seamlessly,\u201d  says  Aikins. \u201cWe  created an  instant  bond  and  a  new  sound  we  can  all  stand  proudly  behind;  which merges our  respective  influences  from  the  Canadian  and  American  music  we  were  raised with. Everyone\u2019 s input is welcome here and everyone has their moment to shine, in the true democratic sense and tradition of a band.\\\"  Paper  Bird  has  always  made  a  point  of  encouraging each  of  its  members to share the  spotlight.  The  group  boasts  three  lead  vocalists  --  singer  Sarah Anderson, singer and keyboard player Genevieve Patterson, and Aikins herself -- all of whom blend  their  voices  in  seamless  three  part  harmonies.  The  instrumental  duties  are shared by Summeril, DeHaven, and drummer Mark Anderson. Hailing  from  Denver,  Colorado,  Paper  Bird  first emerged  from  the  same  environs that  launched  such  outfits  as  Nathaniel  Rateliff  and  the  Night  Sweats  and  the Lumineers.  The  group  has  toured  extensively  throughout  the  U.S.,  sharing  bills with  the  aforementioned  bands,  as  well  as  Daryl  Hall  &  John  Oates,  Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and Shakey Graves. \\r\\nOnPaper  Bird,the  band  collaborates  with  world-renowned  musician,  singer  and songwriter  John  Oates,  who  co-produced  the  album  with  Aikins\u2019   fellow  Canadian David Kalmusky. The album was recorded and  mixed at Addiction Sound Studios in Nashville, and for his part, Oates couldn\u2019 t be more delighted. \u201cPaper Bird is a band that possesses a sound that\u2019 s more than the sum of its parts,\u201dOates  effuses. \u201cIt\u2019 s  the  coming  together  of  two  perfect  trinities.  It  has  three distinctly   unique   female   lead   singers   whose   harmonies   blend   together   as one...united  with  an  inventive,  cohesive  rhythm  section  trio.  I  loved  their  sound from  the  first time  I  heard  them  and  they  just keep  getting better.  They  are  a  true musical  family  united  by  a  unique  and  pure  artistic  vision...a  rare  quality  in  this day and age of so much disposable and less than original music.\u201dPaper  Birdhas  a  sound  that  blends  the  engaging  vocal  harmonies  of  Fleet  Foxes and  The  Lone  Bellow  with  the  classic \u2018 70s  stylings  of  bands  like  Heart  and Fleetwood  Mac  without  imitating  or  emulating  any  one  of  them  in  particular. Indeed,  the  new  music  is  rugged,  resilient  and  flush  with  enthusiasm.  It  conveys the  essence  of  inspired  Americana,  while  still  staying  true  to  its  riveting  rock regimen.  The album starts with the soulful strut of \u201cTo The Light,\u201d and heads into desire and yearning  with  the  single \u201cDon\u2019 t  Want  Half.\u201d  With  its  playful  harmonies  and rhythms, \u201cI Don\u2019 t Mind\u201d captures the ephemeral feelings of love, as \u201cit\u2019 s not easy to  be  a  dreamer,  when  you\u2019 re  sleeping  with  the  wind.\u201d  Paper  Bird  merge  the musical past with the present on \u201cSunday,\u201d conjuring up doo-wop, rock and groove sounds. \u201cThis is definitely the start of something exciting,\u201d Summeril suggests. \u201cWe\u2019 re at a point in our career where we feel we\u2019 re ready to take on the world.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/14/85/55-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.paperbirdband.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"https://www.myspace.com/paperthebird\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/paperbirdband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/PaperBirdBand\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"PaperBirdBand\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.johnnybrendas.com/event/1228203?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
