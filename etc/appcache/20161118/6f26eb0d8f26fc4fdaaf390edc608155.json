Little is known of what actually transpired aboard the shuttle, but in short, Moon Boots became a sentient creature, equipped with reason, intuition, and groove. Before long, he grew tired of working for the space-military-industrial complex and found solace in the soothing sounds of underground disco and R&B boogie records. He knew it was only of matter of time before he was hung up like so many boots before him.

But this introverted interior is the catalyst behind the upward trajectory of his career, which currently includes an impressive back catalogue of inventive, genre-defying club jams, a hectic tour schedule as a member of Crew Love, an accomplished debut album Mating Call and a captivating live show, which truly lays bare his vulnerable inner self with every performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking links with the dirtybird crew initially and later, Soul Clap, helped to push Nick's career forward. It was having the creative freedom offered to him by Eli and Charlie's label, and Wolf + Lamb, that allowed him to flourish and focus on becoming the artist he'd always yearned to be; soulful, loose and free of genre constraints.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou never know who's going to answer when you come knocking on Monaco's door, it could be The Butterfly; na\u00efve, young, wide-eyed and innocent. The Stalker; a creepy, sex-addicted voyeur. The Maintenance Man; the man you call when you're in a jam. All of whom, and more, are components of Nick's real persona.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis colourful cast of characters appear on his very first album Mating Call, an adventurous project that incorporates Nick's own voice and live instrumentation, giving it a strong organic element built around a narrative theme. This is what his album and his sound ultimately represent: an ethos with no boundaries, as opposed to a strict regimented sound. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe door opens and he steps out of his dressing room, Vogueing his way to the stage.

Papa Lu had the chance to absorb all styles of music from Hip Hop to house as an adolescent. His first passion was with Hip Hop. As soon as he graduated from High School he dove right into the business of throwing Hip Hop shows at a venue called The DNA Lounge. He worked with some of the most classic artists of the true school era like Digable Planets, Digital Underground, Gang Starr, Kool Keith, Dj QBert, Jumi, Grand Wisord Theordore, and many more. During that time period more than a handful house music pioneers like Mark Farina, Derrick Carter, Dj Sneak, Kaskade, Heather, Colette, etc were making their waves at that same venue and that's where Papa Lu had learned to love house music. Becoming a house music aficionado Papa Lu had then decided to make the transition into producing quality house music events. He still to this day produces a party named Night Moves at Monarch SF and other events as well in a few of the other fine established clubs of San Francisco. He's worked with artists such as Danny Daze, Jimmy Edgar, Poolside, Amine Edge & Dance, Doctor Dru, Walker & Royce, Lazaro Casanova, Claptone, Juan MacLean, Fur Coat, Crazy P, Noir, Moon Boots, John Tejada, J Boogie, Deejay Theory, Pacific Disco, etc. In the process of becoming deeply involved and passionate with finding new cutting edge artists to book Papa Lu cultivated himself as a quality dj opening and closing for the artists named above and is now in high demand to be added to other local events and more. For Papa Lu, his career as an innovative house dj has just nearly started an budding well. His production with Bryan Boogie (LifeSF/ 2nd Sunday) is in progress and expected to make a lot of traction.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-og.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/13-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/papa-lu\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/djpapalu\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/dj_Papa_Lu\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"dj_Papa_Lu\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://thegreatnorthernsf.com/event/1382048?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
