One year later, almost to the date, the three friends decided to take that thought more seriously. Rearranging their lives so they would be in the same location in Michigan, the members moved in together and put things in motion to became a real band. Their objective with Hollow Earth was to write sincere music and begin touring as much as possible. Quickly recruiting Dave Giandiletti (Guitar) and Jake Hicks (Bass) to complete the line up they wrote a six song EP entitled We Are Not Humanity within the two and half months of their inception and headed off to record at Getaway Group in Massachusetts with Jay Maas (Defeater, Verse, Shipwreck).\\n\\nOn We Are Not Humanity Hollow Earth draw on the influence of legendary bands like Turmoil and Buried Alive, capturing the energy and anger of hardcore that has been lost on so many new bands. Hollow Earth's lyrics are dark with thought provoking premonitions that paint a picture of impending doom that threatens the human existence. Riding into our demise, there's no turning back, the decimation of our world is eminent and Hollow Earth is the perfect soundtrack to play us out. We Are Not Humanity will be released on April 17th, 2012 through Panic Records on CD, Vinyl and Digital formats.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://hollow-earth.bandcamp.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/HollowEarthInc/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/HollowEarthInc\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"HollowEarthInc\"},{\"id\":1642185,\"name\":\"Smoke Signals\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\\\"Blues and bluegrass infused songs with stick-to-your-ribs melodies and high harmonies, Smoke Signals will inspire you to smile and sing along.

The band just dropped The Conditioning EP on April 8 via Itunes, Spotify, and other media outlets. The second single \\\"Ares\\\" is an explosive anthem, built to be the soundtrack for a punishing time in the pit. It is this song's potent live performance, partnered with a massive wall of death, at the 2014 Extreme Thing Sports and Music Festival that is the setting for the band's latest music video, which BlankTV premiered exclusively May 7th.\\r\\n\\r\\nPostings on Craigslist and a handful of mutual friends led to the formation of We Gave it Hell in 2012. They immediately found themselves with a following thanks to an overwhelmingly positive response from the earliest releases, as well as their dedication to playing as many shows as possible throughout the Southwestern United States. Their sound is a combination of Deftones' melody, groove and ambience matched with the pummeling onslaught of metalcore heroes like Born of Osiris. This unique combination of genres has earned them a great deal of respect from fans and peers alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently, the group was handpicked by Sumerian Records as one of the top 17 bands in the country to play in the finals for the label's Road to the Sphinx Competition. They've also played a date on Mayhem Festival and are set to play a date on The All Stars Tour in summer 2014. In their hometown, they've played the main stage at the city's Extreme Thing Festival two years in a row. With all of these shows under their belts, they've managed to share the stage with Bring Me the Horizon, Asking Alexandria, Parkway Drive, Killswitch Engage, Emmure, Born of Osiris, Sleeping with Sirens, Of Mice and Men, Attila, Upon A Burning Body, Issues, Emmure, Thy Art is Murder and many more. After several out of state short tour runs, We Gave It Hell is pushing to tour more and more. A new EP can be expected late spring or early summer 2015.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/wegaveithell\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1340843,\"name\":\"Concepts\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Concepts, an act hailing from Houston, Texas, first started making music in the late spring/early summer of 2011.
