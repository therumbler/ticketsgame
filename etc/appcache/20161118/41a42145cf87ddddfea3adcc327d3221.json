A self-titled debut from a terrific 3-piece that will remind you of everything great about Heavy Metal in the early 80s.\\n\\n\\nNight Demon encompasses the best about that era, but they bring the genre into the modern day with ease. Although they've been compared to NWOBHM acts like Angel Witch, Saxon, Diamondhead, and Samson, as well as some American ones like Riot, they have composed material that sounds fresh in today's world. They breathe new life into the genre with just four fun cuts:\\n\\n1. Night Demon\\n2. The Chalice\\n3. Ancient Evil\\n4. Ritual\\n\\n\\\"Night Demon\\\" is a classic, fist-pumping rock anthem right from the start, extolling the virtues of being Night Demon in verse. With the power of Metal your town is doomed by Night Demon!! Or at least your beer supply. Driving bass lines reminiscent of old Iron Maiden accompany vocals remindful of Guy Speranza of Riot. This first tune lets you know what the rest of the album will be like. They don't stray far from the formula of the era but they exercise everything that was good about it. Without missing a beat, everything that was awesome about the time is brought to new life.\\n\\nNight Demon Official Video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrX95-9W_so\\n\\n\\\"The Chalice\\\" rings true of some of the best of that power-driven metal that combines into a single, catchy, sing-along song, like every song on this album, really. Lyrically, it is one of those songs that just epitomizes what this style of music is supposed to bring. Sealing the selling of one's soul over a drink with the Devil is just another day for some. With deep bass lines, catchy guitar hooks, and an eerie vocal approach, it is perhaps the best executed song on the album.\\n\\n\\\"Ancient Evil\\\".  Now any song about Cthulu better be well done or you're toast. Good for these guys that they did it right!! Storytelling at its best drawing from H.P. Lovecraft's works, it is a fast-paced barn burner that chugs along like a freight train from opening to end. Steeped in classic metal, this cut depends heavily on the vocal performance being delivered properly while eliciting excitement from the listener. Mission is accomplished on this tune, with a delivery that shows the ability and range of Jarvis Leatherby's vocals.\\n\\n\\\"Ritual\\\" closes out the album with a classic double-time thrash piece. Kicking right off with pressing guitar riffs and thunderous drums, this song rips right into you from the start. As the EP started so it ends, reminding everyone that the \\\"Ritual\\\" involves Night Demon, circles of fans, and drinking to be sure. No town will be spared the devastation of a rampaging Rock Band. No magic will protect you from the Night Demon...\\n\\nEmbodying everything that was fun and great of a past era, this band is definitely keeping it old school. They deliver with every song, and show no signs of slowing. Already they have played all over Europe in many festivals including Germany's Keep It True Festival 2014. The KIT is legendary for delivering metal to the masses year in and year out at sold out shows. This band isn't out to change any musical landscapes. They are simply recreating music from a time when great music was plentiful and drawing from its best examples. Whether it's thunderous and driving rhythms or searing guitars and vocals, this EP delivers the best of the era. It ends far too soon, doesn't overstay, and leaves you wanting more in just under 15 minutes.\\n\\nConsisting of Jarvis Leatherby on vocals/bass, Brent Woodward on guitar, and Dusty Squiers on drums, this is an amazing power trio with a ranged vocalist that allows the band to slide around so many of the great sounds of the times. We are destined to hear more of this band, so add their patch to your denim jacket and let the claws of the Night Demon pull you in...\\n\\nNIGHT DEMON:\\nJarvis Leatherby\\nBrent Woodward\\nDusty Squiers\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://nightdemon.net\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/nightdemonband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/NightDemonBand\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"NightDemonBand\"},{\"id\":1775781,\"name\":\"GRAVESHADOW\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"GENRE - Symphonic Metal, Gothic Metal, Thrash Metal, Doom Metal from Sacramento. \\n\\n\\\"Graveshadow is a 2015 \\\"Sammie\\\" nominated (Sacramento News & Review) symphonic metal band from Sacramento, CA.
