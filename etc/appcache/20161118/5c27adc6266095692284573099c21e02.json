Well, let's think back 30 years: Would you have thought that a grindcore band from Birmingham would ever make it into the official album charts with some of the most infernal noise ever put on tape, enter the Guinness book for the shortest song ever recorded or appear in a prominent UK TV series named \\\"Skins\\\"? That it would be part of an Alice Cooper hosted episode of BBC's Never Mind the Buzzcocks to guess from a couple of look-alikes who is the singer in NAPALM DEATH? Could you have ever imagined a down-to-earth lad named Mark \\\"Barney\\\" Greenway, a soccer fan (Aston Villa F.C.), vegetarian, prog metal freak and one of music history's most renowned representatives of \\\"cookie monster\\\" style vocals would become a personality within the extreme music realm that is not about beer-drinking and hell-raising but synonymous with sounding hard while being smart? Well, that is where we are at now. From filthy, sweaty rehearsal rooms and tiny clubs and pubs NAPALM DEATH has conquered every music festival you can think of and toured through corners of the world a lot of bands would not even dare to tour while becoming famous for combining brutal music with political engagement and ethical values beyond the usual clich\u00e9 of sex, drugs & rock n roll. And, as most fans will be delighted to hear, this remarkable story is far from being over\u2026\\r\\n\\r\\nFourteen albums in (not counting the cover-platter \\\"Leaders\u2026Part 2\\\") three decades and NAPALM DEATH remain the leaders of the grindcore / death metal world, once again showing the upstarts how it's done. Not content to simply wear the term \\\"legendary,\\\" the band has once again raised the bar on what it takes to remain at the top of the heap with its highly anticipated new album \\\"Utilitarian\\\". While their past roster reads like a who's who of extreme metal royalty, including Lee Dorrian (Cathedral), Bill Steer (Carcass), Justin Broadrick (Godflesh) and the late Jesse Pintado (Terrorizer) to name a few, it's the current line-up of Mark \\\"Barney\\\" Greenway (vocals), Mitch Harris (guitars), Shane Embury (bass), and Danny Herrera (drums) that has kept the legend alive and seething. \\\"Utilitarian\\\" is the follow-up to the band's much lauded 2009 album, \\\"Time Waits For No Slave\\\", and sees the quartet return in expected raw and uncompromising fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of a gruelling international tour schedule for \\\"Time Waits For No Slave\\\", NAPALM DEATH finally got down to writing for \\\"Utilitarian\\\" in early 2011. It was recorded over the course of the year at Parlour Studios in Northamptonshire, UK with producer Russ Russell monitoring the mayhem, finally mixed and mastered in November. The end result is vicious and chaotic, but Greenway notes that \\\"the ever-present darker, more ambient side of Napalm (references: Swans, My Bloody Valentine, Birthday Party et al) has now gotten faster, too \u2013 or at least the tempo of it varies so it's not just exclusively slow and mournful. This gives it an extra, obtuse dimension. And hopefully people get lost in the frantic thickness of it.\\\"\\r\\n\\\"Utilitarian\\\" runs the gamut from straight-ahead violence and force to pure, undiluted NAPALM DEATH-induced chaos that overall provides a well-rounded bloodletting that's not for the weak and also confronts the listener with such surprising moments as the sax passages by none other than John Zorn on 'Everyday Pox' or choral-like clean sections in 'Fall On Their Swords' or 'Blank Look About Face'. The latter is a perfect bridge to the album's outspoken lyrical content as it viciously attacks politicians' opportunistic talk that according to Greenway only knows one goal: \\\"Say anything to tame a crowd - whether it is sycophantic praise, bullshit morality or rabble-rousing power-speak - as long as they can cling on to their place in the hierarchy.\\\"\\r\\nTrue to the band's tradition of spitting gallons of verbal venom, \\\"Utilitarian\\\" is an in-your-face razor-edged platter of social, cultural and political commentary. Far from being a placard-waving \\\"cause\\\" band, the quartet offer up personal views on the degeneration of society ('Everyday Pox'), the arms trade ('Fall On Their Swords'), sexual and gender expression ('Gag Reflex'), the environment ('Order Of Magnitude') and aspects of everyday life for the common man ('Collision Course', 'Think Tank Trials') revealing Barney's understanding of what to do with your life: \\\"We have a finite period of existence that is all too easy to waste, and ultimately we all deserve happiness and contentment.\\\" The bottom line is: Think for yourself, liberate yourself and don't end up feeding the machine that all too willingly eats you up.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, NAPALM DEATH are special because they never sacrificed their ideals for anything mundane, will continue pleasing their fans with a stunning record named \\\"Utilitarian\\\" and ceaseless touring activities in support of its release while provoking world leaders with all the rage and criticism you can squeeze into a song.

That The Black Dahlia Murder's response to such a challenge comes in the form of the devastating Abysmal serves to once again demonstrate why they are considered one of the most vital bands in contemporary death metal. \\\"Once the record started to come together we knew it was going to be something special,\\\" states vocalist Trevor Strnad. \\\"It's more urgent, it has more dynamics, it's a more emotive record, and it has a more raw, angry sound to it. It's still million mile-per-hour death metal, but when you invest so much thought and emotion into what you're creating you end up with a record that does stand out, and we can hold our heads up high and say yeah, this is our best work.\\\"\\n\\nSince 2001, the Michigan quintet have focused their efforts on writing music that embraces all the finest qualities of melodic death metal yet does not shackle them, giving them room to constantly evolve and grow as musicians. With Abysmal the band have once again progressed while retaining the signature sound that has won them their devoted legion of fans, and making it clear that their best is not in their past. \\\"I still love Everblack and everything we achieved when touring it, and in fact going into that record we faced a massive challenge in following up Ritual (2011), which had also been huge for us. Having two records in a row connect with fans in such a way was amazing, but definitely piled on the pressure going into this new one, because we don't want to let them down, and we don't want to let ourselves down. But we learned a lot in making those two records, and we brought that into Abysmal. We know we can take people's heads off playing super fast, but that doesn't always give listeners something to really chew on. We've learned to focus on creating some drama, interesting dynamics, and most importantly really investing time in thinking about how different parts of songs will make you feel.\\\" While crushingly violent, Abysmal is certainly a long way from being a two-dimensional blast-fest. Often evoking potent melancholy or icy unease, tragedy and apocalyptic gloom also insinuate into the songs alongside the all-out fury, for make no mistake, while this record boasts a variety of dark and atmospheric moods the band have perhaps never sounded so downright pissed. The likes of \\\"Re-Faced\\\" and \\\"Threat Level Number Three\\\" are purpose built to incite chaos, and some of the fastest material the band has ever unleashed explodes from the likes of opener \\\"Receipt\\\", \\\"Asylum\\\", and the haunting title track. This can largely be credited to drummer Alan Cassidy, who joined the band in 2013. \\\"With both Alan and Max (Lavelle, bass) new to the band there was a lot of speculation ahead of dropping Everblack, and though we knew we had a great record it was nice to prove the naysayers wrong. This time out Alan was really able to stamp his identity on the record, and yeah, there was a point where Brian (Eschbach, guitar) said level with me dude: just how fast can you go? And Alan unleashed this thing and we were like okay, let's go faster than we've ever gone then!\\\" Strnad laughs. \\\"But it's not just that, he's injected so much style into everything. He writes really interesting fills, and he cares about having variety and really speaking with what he's doing, and he was involved with the song writing more than any other drummer has been in a long time.\\\" Strnad is just as keen to sing the praises of Lavelle, who also made a more substantial contribution to the record than he did to its predecessor. \\\"We look back on every record and say we need more bass, and Max is a really prevalent part of things live, so we wanted to have that come across more, and he totally nailed it. It's definitely a dirtier bass sound than we've ever had too, which sounds more wild, more live, and adds to the punch.\\\" Guitarists Eschbach and Ryan Knight bring a cavalcade of riffs to the table, upping the stakes in technicality, melody, and sheer blunt force trauma, letting intoxicating flavors of black metal and NWOBHM creep into the vicious assault, and Knight's soloing is at a point where Strnad believes his name should rightfully be thrown in amongst the genre's most prominent shredders. \\\"With every album we allow a bit more time for him to solo and just totally own it, and when he nails it he's really at that Megadeth Rust In Peace level. I do think he deserves to be spoken about in the circles of great metal guitar players. Marty Friedman should buy Ryan a beer, I think, and I genuinely don't see that as something really out of the ballpark.\\\"\\n\\nOf course, Strnad's own contributions are a vital aspect of every TBDM album, and he once again delivers, both in regards to his lyrics and caustic vocals. While his lyrical inspiration remains primarily rooted in horror and the macabre, on Abysmal the theme of hell is prominent, whether it be a literal hell, figurative, or personal one. \\\"Stygiophobic\\\", for instance, which is a slower, crunchy, doom-inflected dirge, sees him focusing on those who are irrationally afraid of hell. \\\"These people spend their every waking moment thinking of going to hell, and every time they go to sleep they see all their friends burning in hell, and this obsession has become a debilitating psychological condition, which is awful, and interesting.\\\" Alongside this, on the scathing \\\"Threat Level Number Three\\\" Strnad goes inside the mind of a \\\"recidivist rapist molester, who has been chemically castrated, focusing on his internal dialogue as he's trying to reenter society.\\\" He explores more fantastic subjects, such as the cruelty and violence of Vlad The Impaler - the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula - in the more melancholic \\\"Vlad, Son Of The Dragon\\\", and he also reflects on issues that have affected him more personally, allowing himself some form of catharsis, most notably on \\\"Receipt\\\" and the title track. However, while despair, isolation, and thoughts of suicide haunt these songs, on burly closer \\\"That Cannot Die Which Eternally Is Dead\\\" he pushes the band's perseverance in the faces of those who might consider counting them out. \\\"What I'm saying in that song is that we can't be stopped by normal means. No matter what kind of challenge or roadblock we face we'll just keep coming, and I think by now our fans know that.\\\"\\n\\nIn tracking the record, the band re-enlisted producer Mark Lewis (Cannibal Corpse, Whitechapel) and former bass player Ryan Williams, who also helped engineer Everblack, their intent to get away from the overt sonic sterility affecting far too many contemporary metal albums. This is a prominent factor in why the record sounds as angry as it does, the band focusing on capturing a raw, live sound that doesn't always strive for absolute perfection. \\\"We wanted a sound that would show we're actually human beings, and not just computers playing death metal. We were not going to resample the drums, sound-replace or quantize anything. We didn't want to have the exact same drum sound as every single freaking band seems to have right now, and that's why essentially going backwards was going forwards for us. The guys have the chops to do it, so it's not like we need to lean on Pro-Tools to make an album, and I think it's the most energetic thing we've done since the very first record, Unhallowed (2003), which had a similar live feel.\\\" As always, artwork was of great importance in expressing the band's vision, and this time they turned to Russian artist Daemorph, who is known for his work in the brutal death metal community. \\\"Again, I was a little unsure quite how we would follow up Everblack, because the artwork Nicholas Keller did was incredible. But we told Daemorph we wanted something that really looked like hell, and he went above and beyond. The first time I saw it I was like yep, that's hell, and I know I definitely don't want to go there!\\\"\\n\\nAt this stage in the game, with typically modest aspirations, Strnad is more interested in maintaining their longevity than shifting records, and if the band never gets any bigger than they are right now he will \\\"die happy a hundred times over\\\". However, this does not mean there is anything even vaguely resembling an end in sight. \\\"We're still young at heart and I feel like the evolution of the band still has a long way to go. I don't see a ceiling on what we can do, and there will be no end. It's just going to be a constant ongoing fight to make better music and be a better band, and it's always going to be time to kick ass.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":100},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":100},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":100},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":100},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":100},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":100},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-og.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":100},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":100},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":100},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":100},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/29-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":100}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.tbdmofficial.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/blackdahliamurder\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/theblackdahliamurderofficial\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bdmmetal\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bdmmetal\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1693373,\"name\":\"Power Trip\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"POWER TRIP\\n\\nFormed in early 2008, Power Trip draw from the sacred texts of classic hardcore, punk, and metal.

In the wake of their rabid live shows, images of impending doom and destruction have become synonymous with the name POWER TRIP.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":560,\"height\":339},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":560,\"height\":339},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":182},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":182},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":121},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":121},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-og.jpg\",\"width\":560,\"height\":339},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":61},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":61},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":303},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":303},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":560,\"height\":339},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/33/31-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":560,\"height\":339}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://powertriptx.bandcamp.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/powertriphc\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/powertripTX?ref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/powertriptx\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"powertriptx\"},{\"id\":1468701,\"name\":\"Abnormality\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Abnormality is an extreme metal band hailing from Massachusetts, United States. Purveying a violent hybrid of the heaviest subgenres in metal, Abnormality mixes technicality and speed with devastating grooves. Taking from a wide range of influences, Abnormality captures the speed and unrelenting viciousness of Hate Eternal and Origin and infuses it with grooves and hooks more reminiscent of Suffocation and Deeds of Flesh. Abnormality came together in 2005, and now features seasoned members Mallika, Jay, Josh, Ben, and Jeremy, all hailing from various underground acts such as Goratory, Ascendancy, Sexcrement, Revengeance, and Iranach.
