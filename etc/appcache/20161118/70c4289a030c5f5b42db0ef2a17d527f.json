Houses\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Hands Like Houses are a fresh and explosive 6 piece from Canberra, Australia. With a rapidly expanding international fanbase, the band has captivated audiences with their electric blend of technical, effects- heavy songwriting with post-hardcore passion and stage presence. Driven by rich lyricism and melodic, emotive vocals in the vein of Emarosa and The Getaway Plan, the band presents a complex and finely crafted mix of guitar and electronics, drawing from a broad range of influence including Thrice, The Receiving End of Sirens and Closure in Moscow.\\n\\nThe closing of 2011 saw the band sign to the respected record label Rise\\nRecords, with their highly anticipated debut album \u02bbGround Dweller\u02bc\\nsubsequently announced to be released worldwide on March 13th.\\nHLH traveled to the USA in 2010 and 2011 to record \u02bbGround Dweller\u02bc with Cameron Mizell of Chango Studios (Woe, Is Me, Sleeping With Sirens,\\nMemphis May Fire). The subsequent single releases, 'This Ain't No Place For Animals', and 'Lion Skin (feat. Tyler Carter and Jonny Craig)' earned the band over 5,000 independent single sales via iTunes during 2011, and their most recent single \u02bbAntarctica\u02bc, released on YouTube through Rise Records, amassed almost 200,000 views in its first month. This, along with the band's self-produced acoustic versions of 'Lion Skin,' 'The Sower', and other tracks off \u02bbGround Dweller\u02bc, their YouTube channels have seen over a million views, growing daily. Boasting a dedicated and fast-growing international fanbase, built through years of personally managing their social networks and independent promotion and touring, Hands Like Houses released their hotly anticipated debut album \u02bbGround Dweller\u02bc on March 13th worldwide through Rise Records. Buoyed by exceptional online hype and pre-order numbers for a debut release, the record broke into the US Billboard Heatseekers and Top 200 charts at #2 and #140 respectively in its\u02bc first week, and is well on track to move over 10,000 copies in the US alone within 4 months of the release.\\n\\nTo date, the band has supported a number of notable acts from Australia and around the world, including The Getup Kids (USA), As Tall As Lions (USA), The Getaway Plan (AUS), Dream On Dreamer (AUS), Hopes Die Last (ITA) and Tonight Alive (AUS). Their 2011 touring schedule saw the band play 50+ shows across Australia and Europe, impressing audiences with a sound and stage presence beyond their standing. 2012 has already seen Hands Like Houses add to their list of local, national and international supports, beginning with Pushover Festival in Melbourne Australia in support of Parkway Drive, Tonight Alive, 360 and others, and continuing onto the USA on the Rise Records Freshman Tour with The Air I Breathe, My Ticket Home, and Palisades. In addition, the band performed on the entire 2012 Scream It Like You Mean It festival tour, performing in support of Attack, Attack, We Came As Romans and The Acacia Strain, and will be supporting Pierce The Veil\u02bcs Fall headlining national tour with Sleeping With Sirens.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":683,\"height\":1024},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-og.jpg\",\"width\":683,\"height\":1024},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":975},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/57-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://handslikehouses.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/handslikehouses\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/HandsLikeHouses\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"HandsLikeHouses\"},{\"id\":1653231,\"name\":\"Our Last NIght\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The best art, music, cinema and other mediums forsake commerce for commerce's sake, delve deep to forge real connection between artist and audience and explore the balance between accessibility and integrity. Opening up a kinetic dialogue with each note, filled with big melodies, intense energy and truly passionate depth of feeling, comes Our Last Night and their defining work, The Age of Ignorance.\\n\\nOur Last Night has perfected the mixture of melody and might. Not content to rest on the laurels of scene ornamentation or status quo presentation, Our Last Night have worked hard to capture the spirit of song-craft that drove their initial inspiration to get themselves on the road. The Age of Ignorance springs forward with the radio-ready-meets-fist-shaking bombast of Rise Against, the earnest power of Taking Back Sunday, the immediate urgency of Underoath and the instantly memorable catchiness of New Found Glory.\\n\\nThe heavy power cherished by Our Last Night supporters who discovered them on The Ghost Among Us (2008) and We Will All Evolve (2010) remains throughout this new set of songs while the band progresses forward with new bravery into increasingly broadminded territory.\\n\\nLead vocalist Trevor Wentworth has developed a set of pipes worthy of his brother, Matt, the band's principal songwriter who previously handled the clean vocals by himself. The brotherly duo are in their finest form yet on The Age Of Ignorance, powering forward with confident, exuberant and empowering vocals that soar and soar.\\n\\nGuitarist Colin Perry, bassist Alex \\\"Woody\\\" Woodrow and drummer Tim Molloy are all in top form as well as Our Last Night weave songs together that twist and turn in only the smartest and most sensible of ways. These aren't random riffs thrown together to show off with a bunch of unintelligible bellowing on top. It's quite the opposite. Our Last Night operates with deliberate, delicious purpose.\\n\\nOur Last Night manages that elusive band's dream: exceeding their fan's expectations while chasing their own creative muse. And producer David Bendeth (Breaking Benjamin, Paramore, Set Your Goals), who mixed the their last album and handled all production on this one, elicited topnotch performances with his mentorship.\\n\\nTracks like \\\"Fate\\\" and \\\"Liberate Me\\\" burn with a fire to incite any crowd into dance floor pandemonium while the record alternately explores heavy duty electronics and acoustics to dazzling effect. Certainly fans of melodic post-hardcore like Saosin or Finch will find something to admire as they explore the Our Last Night catalog.\\n\\nIt's not often one would associate Vans Warped Tour and Linkin Park in the same sentence but Our Last Night manages to straddle that delicate line with grace and skill throughout their third album. It's not so much a shift away from their past as it is a full embracing of the strongest elements of their tried and true sound through the exploration of the furthest reaches of each extreme. The melodies are bigger and brighter than ever while the intensity level is also raised in equal measure at the same time.\\n\\nSo many truths are hidden from view in modern life. Government secrets, medicinal cures, the keys to sustainable living, you name it. Locked away and tightly guarded these simple but essential building blocks remain obscured. It's a time when human connection can be so hard to achieve just as it's become more important than ever. The Age Of Ignorance overall is acutely aware of this lyrically and in terms of vibe, tackling the bigger questions head-on with the title track, drawn from late nights documentary viewing. This is a heady band with vision and forethought who hearken back to the days when a lyric sheet was really worth ponder and study.\\n\\nThat Our Last Night hails from the somewhat culturally isolated state of New Hampshire is certainly worth noting. Not many bands have made it to a national level from their scene. They were able to interconnect with neighboring New England locales but it's still something of a minor miracle how far the quintet has come in just a few short years. One of the keys to their success has been their steadfast refusal to surrender to easy formulas or tired scene clich\u00e9s.\\n\\nOur Last Night puts a focus on songwriting as a craft and the resulting achievement is 36 minutes of pure expression that is The Age of Ignorance. It is as much to be heard as it is to be experienced. The band's aim is nothing short of a total connection with the crowd. When the listener truly feels something, the goal has been reached.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":406},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":406},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":127},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":127},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":85},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":85},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-og.jpg\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":423},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":42},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":42},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":212},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":212},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":275},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/75/61-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":275}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.ourlastnight.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://myspace.com/ourlastnight\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/ourlastnightband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/OLNband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"OLNband\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1653233,\"name\":\"The Color Morale\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"CONSISTING OF GARRET RAPP (VOCALS), DEVIN KING (GUITAR), AARON SAUNDERS (GUITAR), STEVE CAREY (DRUMS) AND MIKE HONSON (BASS), THE COLOR MORALE STANDS WITH THEIR FANS.
