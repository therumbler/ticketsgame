Campbell & Teresa Williams\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Multi-instrumentalist-vocalist Larry Campbell and singer-guitarist Teresa Williams have rocked many a venue, as both center stage performers and invaluable assets to world class acts. A shortlist of artists who\u2019ve benefited from their talents, live and in studios, reads like a Who\u2019s Who of Music Icons: Bob Dylan (Larry spent eight years on the Never Ending Tour), Paul Simon, Little Feat, Hot Tuna, Phil Lesh, Emmylou Harris, Sheryl Crow, Mavis Staples, and, for one miraculous seven-year stretch, Levon Helm. Now, with an eponymous debut album, the couple brings it all back home. Larry Campbell and Teresa Williams may have been simmering awhile, but the timing is perfect; the eleven tracks, produced by Campbell, distill everything into a potent, infectious blend of Americana style and timeless soul, offered with a relaxed generosity that can only come from rich experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nLarry and Teresa\u2019s story begins at New York\u2019s famed Bottom Line club in the mid 80s; she was singing country, he was playing pedal steel. It was love at first chord. \u201cShe was the real deal,\u201d native New Yorker Larry says. \u201cNone of that Urban Cowboy nonsense. And she was clock-stopping gorgeous. I was smitten.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d thought country music players in New York was an oxymoron,\u201d says Tennessee-born Teresa. \u201cBut he saved my life on that stage. I thanked him for bringing the heavy steel down to play just a few songs, and when we looked into each other\u2019s eyes I saw everything he is, the depth of his soul.\u201d They married soon after, setting off on their own individual highways, but always circling back to each other. Among other adventures, Teresa originated the role of country music pioneer Sara Carter in the musical Keep On the Sunny Side, and Larry achieved renown as the go-to roots music guy for sessions, tours, and pit bands, the dude who\u2019d mastered a dizzying array of stringed instruments and styles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seeds for a duet project were unwittingly planted in their courting days, when Larry and Teresa sang and played with the locals under her great-great grandmother\u2019s Tennessee cedar tree, the same one under which they married. (These gatherings continue to this day.) Later, when the duo was song-swapping all night with the band in the back of Bob Dylan\u2019s tour bus, Dylan\u2019s longtime manager Jeff Kramer told Larry he was crazy not to make hay with what they had as a duo. But their schedules kept the idea on the back burner until 2005, when Levon Helm called. He\u2019d beaten cancer, was invigorated as never before, and was putting together a band for the soon-to-be legendary Midnight Rambles at his barn-studio in Woodstock, NY. He wanted some Campbell-Williams mojo to help make the most of his surprise fourth act. This humble beginning \u2013 playing in a barn on a dirt road \u2013 inaugurated the greatest musical experience of Larry and Teresa\u2019s lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nLarry became the unflappable leader of the shape-shifting Midnight Ramble Band, earning three Grammys for producing Levon\u2019s final three CDs; Teresa, as an indispensable band member, frequently brought the house down. Larry Campbell and Teresa Williams is an extension of that time, featuring eight originals and three covers honed on the carpet of Levon\u2019s barn, under the gaze of grateful fans. Songs like the Muscle Shoals-inflected CD opener \u201cSurrender to Love,\u201d heart-wrenching ballad\u201cAnother One More Time,\u201d and boot-stomper \u201cBad Luck Charm,\u201d feature the distinctive texture of two entwining voices who\u2019ve been through a lot together \u2013 the good, the bad, and the joyous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt was the most pure musical experience I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Larry says of their time with Levon. \u201cIt gave me the template for how to make music for the rest of my life: no egos, no agenda, no petty stuff. I looked forward to every gig I ever did with Levon, I loved doing it, and when it was over I couldn\u2019t wait for the next one. I got inspired to write more songs for Teresa and me to sing.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Teresa, singing in the church-like space at the Midnight Rambles was full circle for her childhood discovery of the magic between an audience and an artist. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a time not singing in front of people. I sang in church, at school, everywhere. I didn\u2019t know anything about making records. I just knew connection to an audience was everything. While standing onstage Saturday nights at Levon\u2019s \u2013 musically true north \u2013 in that intimate space, I realized: this was my dream, and I\u2019m in it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen performing at Jorma Kaukonen\u2019s Fur Peace Ranch in Ohio, Teresa took on Reverend Gary Davis\u2019 \u201cKeep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning,\u201d infusing the apocalyptic gospel tune with show-stopping, pew-jumping fervor. Her roots as a seventh-generation Mississippi Delta cotton-farm girl rose to the surface. The song became part of the Midnight Ramble repertoire, and captured on Larry Campbell and Teresa Williams, it\u2019s a powerful force indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Levon\u2019s 2012 passing, they grieved, celebrated his life, and got to work finishing Larry Campbell and Teresa Williams. They had the tunes, and, with drummer (and ace recording engineer) Justin Guip and Ramble Band member Byron Isaacs on bass, they had an ass-kicking, road-worthy band.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the lovefest of guests on Larry Campbell and Teresa Williams sweetened the pot considerably: Amy Helm\u2019s voice melding with Larry and Teresa\u2019s on the gorgeous Grateful Dead hymn \u201cAttics Of My Life,\u201d Little Feat keyboardist Bill Payne\u2019s rollicking touch on several tracks, and Levon himself appearing on \u201cYou\u2019re Running Wild,\u201d a tune made famous by the Louvin Brothers, now given an Orbison touch (originally recorded during Levon\u2019s Dirt Farmer sessions). Finally, it all dovetailed into place.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Larry Campbell and Teresa Williams, this duo not only brings a lot to the table, they bring the table itself \u2013 plus the house, the still, the church, the marriage bed, the sawdust-covered floor, and abiding, unconditional love, all carried in two voices harmonizing across hills, hollers, porches, and fire escapes. Those close harmonies ride atop music made in a mountain refuge, far from the madding crowd, connected to a spirit that lives on in song.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":169},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":169},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":113},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":113},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-og.jpg\",\"width\":1920,\"height\":1080},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":56},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":56},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":281},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":281},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":366},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/09/15-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":366}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.larryandteresa.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/LarryandTeresaMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/LarryandTeresa\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"LarryandTeresa\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1770684,\"name\":\"Mickelson (solo)\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\u201cMickelson sings with aching urgency, cloaked in a dark fog that keeps his melodies balancing on the edge of unresolved, underscoring his take that life is never an all-easy road.
