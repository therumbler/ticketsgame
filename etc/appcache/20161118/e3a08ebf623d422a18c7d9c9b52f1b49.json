Brothers\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"THE WOOD BROTHERS \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe cover of The Wood Brothers' gorgeous new album, 'Paradise,' is adorned with an illustration of a mule staring at a carrot dangling just inches in front of its mouth. The carrot, though, is hanging from a stick affixed to the mule's own head. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"In some ways, he's already got it,\\\" explains guitarist Oliver Wood. \\\"And in some ways, \\r\\nhe'll never have it.\\\" \\r\\n \\r\\nThat paradox is at the core of 'Paradise,' an album about longing and desire and the ways in which the pursuit of fulfillment can keep it perpetually out of our reach. It's a beautiful  collection,  the  band's  most  sophisticated  work  to  date  and  also  their  most rocking, with bassist Chris Wood playing electric on tracks for the first time. Recorded at Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye studio in Nashville, 'Paradise' captures the latest chapter in the ongoing evolution of a band\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand a family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnavigating the joy and challenges of a \\r\\nlife in music. \\r\\n \\r\\nDubbed  \\\"masters  of  soulful  folk\\\"  by  Paste,  The  Wood  Brothers  released  their  debut studio album, 'Ways Not To Lose,' on Blue Note in 2006. You'd be forgiven at the time for expecting it to be something of a side project. Chris Wood already had legions of devoted fans for his incomparable work as one-third of Medeski Martin & Wood, while his brother Oliver toured with Tinsley Ellis before releasing a half-dozen albums with his band King Johnson. Almost a decade later and with drummer Jano Rix added as a permanent  third  member,  it's  become  quite  clear  that  The  Wood  Brothers  is  indeed the main act. \\r\\n \\r\\n'Paradise'  follows  the  band's  acclaimed  2013  release  'The  Muse,'  which  was  recorded almost  entirely  live  around  a  tree  of  microphones  in  Zac  Brown's  Southern  Ground studio. Hailed previously by the New York Times for their \\\"gripping\\\" vocals and by the LA  Times  for  their  \\\"taught  musicianship,\\\"  the  brothers  found  the  live  setting  to  be  a remarkable showcase for their live chemistry and charismatic magnetism. But when it came  time  to  record  'Paradise,'  their  fifth  studio  album,  the  band  knew  the  music called for a different approach. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"For this album, we wanted to have a more up-close and dry sound,\\\" explains Chris. \\\"I worked on another record at Easy Eye and I just loved the room. Dan's studio is cool because it's not old, but it feels that way when you walk into it. It reminds me of Sun Studios. It just has that feeling of a small room with natural compression, and I think you hear that in the sounds on the record.\\\" \\r\\n \\r\\nThe decision to record in Nashville was no coincidence either, as this marks the first album written with the entire band living in Music City.  \\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"Oliver  and  I  spent  a  lot  of  hours  just  in  a  room  together  writing  songs,\\\"  says  Chris. \\\"That's  really  never  happened  before.  All  the  music  in  the  past  was  written  long distance  or  over  the  course  of  touring.  It's  definitely  the  most  collaborative  album we've ever made.\\\" \\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"It  was  kind  of  a  luxury  to  be  able  to  play  together  not  just  at  a  soundcheck,\\\"  adds Jano.  \\\"It  was  a  different  starting  point.  Rather  than  people  bringing  in  compositions that were relatively finished, we were starting from the ground up as a group.\\\" \\r\\n \\r\\nThe album opens with \\\"Singing To Strangers,\\\" which sets the tone for what's to come both musically and thematically. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"Singing  to  strangers  is  something  we  do  every  night,\\\"  explains  Oliver,  \\\"and  there's some  satisfaction  about  singing  to  strangers.  It's  this  weird  thing  that  I  think  we  get addicted to. It's not that we need attention as much as we need connection. On a good \\r\\nnight, when we're singing to strangers, everybody in the room bonds, and you have this amazing sense of connection.\\\" \\r\\n \\r\\nThat desire for connection permeates the album, from \\\"Touch Of Your Hand\\\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201da song about  what  Chris  describes  as  \\\"the  most  basic  human  need  that  there  is to  \\\"Two Places\\\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201da track about longing for home and family while on the road\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto \\\"Never And Always,\\\"  which  examines  the  fundamental  emotional  experiences  of  loneliness  and belonging.  \\\"Snake  Eyes\\\"  and  \\\"American  Heartache\\\"  both  explore  the  dark  side  of longing,  how  the  constant  need  for  more  in  our  consumer  culture  can  engender  a perpetual  dissatisfaction  with  never  having  enough,  while  on  \\\"Without  Desire,\\\"  they find the beauty and the magic that the titular emotion can bring into our lives. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"Desire gets a bad rap sometimes,\\\" explains Chris, \\\"and people think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the root of all of our problems. We wanted a song that said, 'Maybe it's not, maybe we need it.' What would it be like if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t desire all those good things in life?\\\" \\r\\n \\r\\nIn  addition  to  Chris's  electric  bass,  which  appears  on  two  tracks,  the  album  also showcases  Jano's  \\\"shuitar,\\\"  a  portmanteau  for  \\\"shitty  guitar.\\\"  The  name  belies  the instrument's  complexity,  though.  It's  actually  an  acoustic  guitar  that  Jano  has  rigged up with noisemakers to function as an easy-to-travel-with drum kit. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"I made one in The Wood Brothers because we needed a portable drum set we could take to play on sessions and on the radio,\\\" he explains, \\\"but then we've been using it so much live, we started writing for it and not wanting it to even sound like a drum set anymore. We wanted to let it be its own thing.\\\" \\r\\n \\r\\nIt  turns  up  prominently  on  \\\"Heartbreak  Lullaby,\\\"  which  also  features  guitar  playing from Oliver inspired by field recordings of African folk musicians. There's more to Jano than percussion, though, as he sits down at the piano on several tracks on 'Paradise,' including album closer \\\"River Of Sin.\\\" \\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"That  song  imagines  how  when  people  get  baptized  in  a  river,  it's  supposed  to  wash away their sins,\\\" explains Chris. \\\"But what happens to the water? Where do the sins go? And what if you live downstream from all that baptizing?\\\" \\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"A lot of the songs are dealing with these themes of longing and desire,\\\" adds Oliver, \\\"but  the  album  finishes  with  'River  of  Sin'  because  it's  a  positive  and  empowering message,  which  is  that  you  can't  really  do  anything  unless  you're  persistent.  The narrator is humble and understands that there are all these things larger than him and he's just trying to understand them and he's determined to do better and be as good as he can. And he recognizes the only way to do that is to keep trying.\\\" \\r\\n \\r\\nIt's  a  fitting,  lovely,  gospel-tinged  ending  to  an  album  that  traces  both  the  darkness and the beauty in our nature, the perpetual hope and the futility of it all. The quest for  the  carrot  often  blinds  us  to  the  fact  that  we  already  possess  it,  and  that's  the irony of desire. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"He  who  is  not  contented  with  what  he  has  would  not  be  contented with  what  he would like to have.\\\" Socrates said that. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\\"I can't live without desire / If I didn't want anything / Why would I rise? / Why would I sing?\\\" The Wood Brothers said that.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/18/51-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thewoodbrothers.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/thewoodbrothers\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/thewoodbrothers\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/TheWoodBrothers\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"TheWoodBrothers\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1028631,\"name\":\"Ben Sollee\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Kentucky-born cellist and composer Ben Sollee likes to keep moving. He kicked off 2014 with the release of his score for the documentary film Maidentrip. In March, he performed at Carnegie Hall as part of a tribute to Paul Simon. And you may have caught Sollee on the road supporting song-writer William Fitzsimmons throughout April and May. If you've seen him perform, you know it's not to missed.\\n\\nFor listeners just discovering Ben's music, you'll find that there's a lot more to it than songs. Over the 6 years following the release of his debut record, Learning to Bend, Sollee has told an unconventional story with his rugged cello playing. Seeking a deeper connection to communities on the road, Ben first packed his touring life onto his bicycle in 2009. Since then he has ridden over 4,000 miles from show to show. He has been invited to perform and speak on sustainability at a number of festivals including South by Southwest Music (2011) and TEDx San Diego (2012).\\n\\nCloser to home, Ben has devoted a tremendous amount of energy to raising awareness about the practice of mountaintop removal mining in Central Appalachia. His 2010 collaborative album Dear Companion (Sub Pop) brought together fellow Kentucky artist Daniel Martin Moore with producer Jim James (My Morning Jacket) to shed light on the issue. In teaming up with international organizations such as Patagonia Clothing and Oxfam America, Ben has come to be known as a thoughtful activist who mobilizes his audiences to take environmental actions through the power of live music.\\n\\nLike his contemporaries Chris Thile and Abigail Washburn, Sollee's music is difficult to pin down. Following a performance at the Lincoln Center's American Songbook series, the New York Times remarked how Sollee's \\\"\u2026meticulous, fluent arrangements continually morphed from one thing to another. Appalachian mountain music gave way to the blues, and one song was appended with a fragment from a Bach cello suite, beautifully played.\\\" It's Ben's quality of narrative and presence on stage that unifies his musical influences.\\n\\nHowever, always on the move, Sollee's musical career has expanded beyond the stage into film and TV. Shows like ABC's Parenthood and HBO's Weeds have placed featured Ben's songs. In 2013, he was invited by director Mark Steven Johnson to write a song for the film Killing Season starring John Travolta and Robert De Niro. Ben has also has written music for ballet, most recently performing with the North Carolina Dance Theater in the world premiere of Dangerous Liaisons, and is currently at work on scores for several pieces of theatre. He continues touring, including headlining dates throughout the United States in the fall of 2014, and has recently returned from his first solo tour of Europe, which took him to three countries to play eleven shows in two weeks.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":639},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":682},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/08/01-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bensollee.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/bensollee\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/bensollee\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/BenSollee\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"BenSollee\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.granadatheater.com/event/1278793?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
