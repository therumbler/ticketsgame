This is not your Mom's Jam Band, barriers of specific genres cannot contain the sound. Given names by others like interstellar mountain-funk, fusion jam, and earth soul, an Amoramora experience is an eclectic mix of improvisational musical gumbo. The instrumentation of guitar, bass, percussion, trumpet, and EWI mixed in with vocals add up to endless and truly original musical possibilities (that are proven to create a large dance party). The quartet creates a different set list every night to keep their audience engaged and returning to dance and shake their bones. The elements of an Amoramora experience blend together integral aspects of Progressive Funk, Psychedelic Rock, Roots Reggae, Improvisational Rock, Soul, Jazz, Bluegrass, Americana, Big Band, and Calypso. Amoramora has entertained audiences across their home state of Colorado and the Midwest. In the future Amoramora plans to continue to play shows locally and tour regionally to promote their vibrational tones and spread the word.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.amoramoramusic.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/amoramoramusic/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/amoramora_music\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"amoramora_music\"},{\"id\":1743465,\"name\":\"Envy Alo\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Born in the foothills of Boulder, CO in the fall of 2015, Envy Alo has quickly created a unique signature sound built on an array of diverse influences ranging from old school organ-trio jazz/funk to newer, heavier rock and fusion stylings.\\n\\nEnvy Alo is Aaron Pettine, Tyler Gwynn, and Kevin Hinder. Aaron and Tyler have been performing for years locally in a variety of Boulder bands including Booster and Tenth Mountain Division, respectively. Kevin recently transplanted to Boulder from the Baltimore, MD area, performing in a number of bands in MD and VA over the years. \\n\\nAaron and Kevin met in college, and shared a mutual appreciation for the diverse styles of music each enjoyed, and linked up with Tyler after hearing the thunderous drumming of the TMD driving force. After a few jam sessions the three had an undeniable chemistry, and quickly had a nucleus of original songs crafted. With numerous upcoming gigs throughout the front range, stay tuned as this group continues to evolve and develop into a crazed funkadelic dance party for your eardrums.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/envy-alo\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/envyalo/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1350123?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
