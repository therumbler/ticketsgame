These 37 minutes of new music consolidate the best of everything the band\u2019s got to offer: their utmost respect for headbang-inducing riffs, their trademarked aggression, their tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, and their talent for extracting meaning out of the absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\nRising from the squalor of a cursed punk house for their live debut at a New Year\u2019s Eve keg party welcoming in 2001, founding members Ryan Waste and Tony Foresta quickly embraced a DYI ethic to spread the word about their band and graduated to booking shows out-of-state and even in Mexico. After a self-titled EP and the Waste \u2018Em All debut album in 2003, bassist Phil \u201cLandPhil\u201d Hall and former Melt Banana drummer Dave Witte were ushered into the fold. This line-up went on to record three full-length albums for Earache Records (2005\u2019s Hazardous Mutation, 2007\u2019s The Art Of Partying, and 2009\u2019s Massive Aggressive), earning such accolades throughout their career as \u201cMUNICIPAL WASTE do it so well that any track could squeeze comfortably between D.R.I. and Gang Green on a mix tape\u201d from Spin Magazine, \u201cNo band sound more authentic,\u201d from Alternative Press, \u201cA gold standard\u201d from Decibel magazine, and \u201cUndeniably the best at what they do,\u201d from Outburn magazine. Visually, the band also delivered, as evidenced by the success of the devil-may-care and often outrageous attitude of their videos which have all become fan-chanted anthems at their live shows. The fact is, no one could argue against MUNICIPAL WASTE\u2019s reputation as the ultimate feel-good party band.\\r\\n\\r\\nDedicated to keeping the spirit of the 1980\u2019s cross-over scene alive, it was with their uncontrollable mirth and succinct songs that lead MUNICIPAL WASTE to reap the rewards of their hard work. By the time they signed with new label Nuclear Blast in 2011, they had proven themselves as die-hard road warriors who could tour & perform with bands outside their genre such as Suicidal Tendencies, The Casualties, 7 Seconds, Circle Jerks, Sick Of It All, GWAR, Lamb Of God, Children Of Bodom, and At The Gates and win over their crowds. Here they are 11 years later and their rabid fan base \u2013 which includes fans of metal, punk, and hardcore - continues to expand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith artwork by Justin Osbourn of Slasher Design, 2012\u2019s The Fatal Feast is the first MUNICIPAL WASTE album to feature contributions from invited guests.
