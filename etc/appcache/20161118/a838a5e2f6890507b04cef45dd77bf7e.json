It\u2019s more than a name. It\u2019s a movement. A passion for music and more importantly it\u2019s meaning. As artists, songsmiths, producers, and entertainers, Jon Stone and Kristy Osmunson define American Young this way. They are seasoned veterans on how music can inherently affect emotion and even culture. The collaborative fresh new duo already claim songwriting credits for hit makers Kenny Chesney, Lee Brice, Rascal Flatts, Blake Shelton and more. Recording and writing comes from a deep, poignant place with a desire to affect global audiences with songs featuring tight harmonies and storytelling. \u201cAmerican Young represents a sound with no boundaries. We are squarely focused on delivering our own brand of music and hope that folks will find our songs everything from haunting to dramatic and intense\u201d, says Jon.\\r\\nJon Stone and Kristy Osmunson may seem familiar to you. They\u2019ve both been in Nashville and have explored their options in country music before. Jon as a solo act, then a successful producer and songwriter (\u201cMe and My Gang,\u201d \u201cA Woman Like You\u201d) and Kristy as a founding member and sizzling fiddle player of the duo Bomshel.\\r\\nBut what isn\u2019t familiar is their music. That\u2019s because no one\u2014NO ONE\u2014is making music like this.\\r\\nYes, it is absolutely country with its often picturesque, usually compelling, sometimes downright gripping lyrics. Absolutely country with arrangements and instrumentation that brings those lyrics and effortless vocals so far forward they reach past your auditory and right into your heart, right into your soul, right into your gut. From the easy, almost hushed jangly plea of \u201cLove Is War,\u201d to the driving, fiddle-laden anger of \u201cWasn\u2019t Gonna Drink Tonight,\u201d American Young isn\u2019t content with their audience being passive listeners to their music. They want them to feel it in their soul. That\u2019s the sign of two artists so impassioned, so eaten up with making music that they can\u2019t help but do it.\\r\\nOf course, Jon wouldn\u2019t readily admit that at first. \u201cMy life was going so well and I was peaceful....and then she came up to me.\u201d Kristy asked, \u201c\u2019What are you doing with the artist thing?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018It\u2019s always been the dream, but I\u2019m so busy producing and writing songs. I\u2019ve always had a passion for entertaining an audience, but I was at a point where I questioned whether it was apart of God\u2019s plan for me, and I felt like I had no choice, but to be at peace with that or it was going to wreck my life.\u201d At peace until Kristy\u2019s genuine interest and persistence gave him pause to reconsider and then try again.\\r\\nIt only took one time of casually playing together for the pair to feel the evident chemistry and realize they were embarking on something very special. And that they had a sound so singularly unique that it is the stuff that musical trends are born from. Still, Jon turned to producer Paul Worley (Lady Antebellum). \u201cWe recorded some guitar vocals, and I called Paul Worley and I said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to play you something,\u2019\u201d remembers Jon. \u201cI played him these songs and I said, \u2018I have to do this, don\u2019t I?\u2019 And he said, \u2018You have to do this. You have to do this.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nIt turns out that Kristy and Jon were exactly what each other needed. \u201cI\u2019ve waited my whole life to find someone I could play with like that,\u201d smiles Kristy. \u201c\u2018Cause that\u2019s really all we do. The stage is our sandbox and we bring different toys and make things.\u201d The admiration is mutual. \u201cI realized today that if she hadn\u2019t found me, I would have never gotten to live my dream of being a singer, says Jon. \u201cAnd if I hadn\u2019t found her, she would have never realized and found who she is.\u201d\\r\\nThat\u2019s how one of freshest new acts on the country music scene is born.\\r\\nTapping the vocal ability of both Jon and Kristy\u2014a talent she wasn\u2019t aware she even had\u2014has revealed an earthy, organic and authentic sound that has developed naturally and effortlessly. The relationship between the two is very yin and yang. Jon\u2014the consummate, meticulous producer, focused on perfect tones and notes. Kristy \u2014 the high-energy performer with an eye on an entertaining, fun live show. The combination means that when the dynamic duo hit the stage, not only is the show technically sound, it\u2019s a feast for the musical soul...but sometime s that requires Kristy to level out the perfectionist in Jon. \u201cI just whack him with my bow every now and then, and he starts having fun,\u201d she laughs. \u201cWhere he is the studio\\r\\nOz back there wizarding the whole thing, it\u2019s not the part I\u2019ve ever focused on. I\u2019ve always been a player, so my focus has always been on making a show that is just going to be epic and amazing.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s never been my focus ever, not one time,\u201d laughs Jon. \u201cWhen I saw some footage of me performing on stage...I need to work on having fun. \u201d\\r\\nSurprisingly, with the accomplished songwriters that both Jon and Kristy are, their debut single, \u201cLove Is War,\u201d is an outside cut. Penned by the prolific combination of Jonathon Singleton, Kyle Sackley and Billy Montana, the tune showcases surpr isingly sparse production considering Jon\u2019s affinity for perfection. The arrangement is loose, almost acoustic, and the vocals are raw and full of emotion allowing the simple, yet complex lyric to rise to the top of the listening experience.\\r\\n\u201cIt completely defines who we are from the first note of the song,\u201d says Jon. \u201cIt\u2019s a great introduction to American Young for so many reasons, but for one, Kristy and I are singing every note of the song together. We\u2019re playing on the record. It\u2019s an amazing song, such a well-written song, and we totally believe it and it sounds like it. I can tell when she sings the song that she believes it, and I guarantee she says the same thing about me. Every time we sing it, it\u2019s just...oh wow. I realize that this is going to be the most important thing I ever do in my whole life.\u201d\\r\\nKristy adds, \u201cThis is going to be one of those music concepts that is a pivotal project. It has the power to motivate change. It has the power to inspire a different way of thought. This song does that and more. The song says exactly what we all do in relationships. We simply give up. We stop learning how to talk to each other. We stay angry, and that\u2019s not what we need to do. We need to learn. We need to fight for love.\u201d\\r\\nSo, how is this time different? How is American Young different for Jon Stone and Kristy Osmunson? \u201cI think that somebody has to fail enough to not be afraid of success. Frankly, we\u2019ve failed so much that success would be such a by-product of just doing something that we loved,\u201d laughs Jon.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":639},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":682},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/00/46/73-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://americanyoung.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/AmericanYoung?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/american_young\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"american_young\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1317885?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
