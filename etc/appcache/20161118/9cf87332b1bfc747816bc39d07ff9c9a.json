Single\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"If there was an indie-rock Jeopardy! category, the following would certainly be a question: \u201cWho is the only musician to have played with Bob Mould, Robert Pollard, Superchunk, Britt Daniel, and Telekinesis \u2013 and served as the inspiration for Dave Grohl to devote his life to playing music?\u201d If you answered Jason Narducy for $5,000, you\u2019d probably win that episode. \u201cWatching Jason was the first time I thought I could start my own band, and write my own kind of music,\u201d Dave Grohl says. \u201cJason totally set my life in this new direction. It wasn\u2019t a Jimmy Page or KISS poster I had \u2013 it was fuckin\u2019 him!\u201d  Indeed, if indie rock has a Zelig, a Forrest Gump, it\u2019s Narducy. \u201cJason's been doin' the rock since he was a snot-nosed little punk,\u201d Robert Pollard notes. \u201cAnd I can attest from his work with me on the road that he's got it down. And it's not going to stop anytime soon.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nNarducy\u2019s career in rock does prove uniquely epic upon inspection, and continues as such to this day. He first appeared as a co-founder of Verb\u00f6ten \u2013 one of the seminal acts in the Chicago punk scene that produced groundbreaking bands like Naked Raygun and Big Black. Narducy then went on to become frontman/songwriter/guitarist for Verbow, another beloved Windy City outfit who signed a major-label deal with Epic/Sony during the \u201890s alt-rock bubble. He followed that up with an ongoing, nearly decade-long run as indie-rock\u2019s secret weapon \u2013 serving as bassist and backing vocalist for indie-underground icons like Mould, Pollard, and Superchunk, as well as Seattle\u2019s indie power-pop faves Telekinesis. Now Narducy is returning to center stage as a bandleader with Fragmented World \u2013 the debut album from Split Single. A new project formed with fellow travelers Britt Daniel (Spoon, Divine Fits) on bass and drummer Jon Wurster (Superchunk, Mountain Goats, Bob Mould, Ben Gibbard, Robert Pollard), Split Single proves equal parts solo project and collective. \u201cI liked the concept of a split single,\u201d Narducy says. \u201cIt\u2019s a communal thing: two bands have to work together in this handshake commitment, which then exposes each band to the other\u2019s audience. It\u2019s also the name of a two-stroke motorcycle engine invented at the turn of the century to be more efficient and powerful than previous engines. All those things together seemed to really reflect the spirit of what we did.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe nucleus of Split Single came into being during a rare lull for Narducy at the end of 2011. Narducy hadn\u2019t written new original material for eight years \u2013 until an unexpected challenge popped out of the ether: a friend, Steve Dawson, asked Narducy to do a solo set to support Dawson\u2019s band Dolly Varden at famed Chicago venue Schubas in January. \u201cI thought, \u2018What if I wrote and played ten new songs?\u201d Narducy says. \u201cThe show went well, and three songs I\u2019d written for it \u2013 \u2018Never Look Back,\u2019 \u2018Love Is You,\u2019 and \u2018My Eyes\u2019 \u2013 actually ended up on Fragmented World. I was happy being a band guy, and still am \u2013 I\u2019ve had enough day jobs to realize this is the best one ever \u2013 but I ended up writing forty more songs. I realized I had to do something with them.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m used to hearing Jason making me sound better, but it\u2019s funny and familiar as well to hear his voice standing out in front again,\u201d Bob Mould says. In fact, it was during recording sessions for Mould\u2019s Silver Age album in San Francisco that February, Narducy played the demos for bandmate Wurster, creating additional momentum. \u201cJon really responded to the material,\u2019\u201d Narducy recalls. \u201cPlaying with him so much, I\u2019ve learned he\u2019s the best type of drummer \u2013 one who raises the energy and really pushes the song along into a complete whole.\u201d \u201cI think a drummer\u2019s job should be to support the song and not get in the way of it,\u201d Wurster says. \u201cAnd these songs were so good I really didn\u2019t want to get in the way of them.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cBritt Daniel was then the first person I thought of to round out the recording collective,\u201d Narducy continues. \u201cWe\u2019d known each other a long time, and had talked about collaborating after playing together at this L.A. Bob Mould tribute concert in 2011. He\u2019d told me bass was his favorite instrument, and I knew what Britt would bring to the arrangements and backing vocals would be invaluable.\u201d \u201cThe songs were great \u2013 I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, and there were some curveballs!\u201d Daniel says. \u201cI\u2019m always wearing so many hats, so I loved the idea of being in a band where all I do is play bass on someone else\u2019s stuff. I felt like a session musician, which was so cool. Still, I got pretty in depth: there were no preconceptions, which is what collaboration is all about.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a single impromptu practice \u2013 \u201cWe rehearsed at Britt\u2019s house for a couple hours the night before we started recording,\u201d Wurster says. \u201cJason was playing acoustic guitar, Britt was on an unamplified bass, and I kept time tapping on my knees\u201d \u2013 the trio settled in for a brisk four-day session overseen by studio guru Ken Sluiter (Jerry Lee Lewis, Kelly Hogan, OK Go, The Mekons). \u201cThere was no time to second guess,\u201d Daniel laughs. \u201cI haven\u2019t made a record that fast in the last fifteen years!\u201d Recording took place at Los Angeles\u2019 hallowed Sound Factory, whose pop cultural bona fides proved inescapable. \u201cThere were a lot of Linda Ronstadt records on the walls,\u201d Narducy notes. \u201cAll these records from our childhoods were made there,\u201d Wurster adds. \u201cIt was fun to open the bathroom door and see a gold record for The Four Seasons\u2019 \u2018December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)\u2019 \u2013 one of the first records I ever bought \u2013 hanging in the corner.\u201d Daniel, meanwhile, had to cope with an onslaught of hilarity from Narducy and Wurster (who\u2019s becoming as well known for his comedic work with Tom Scharpling and writing for TV series like Tim and Eric Awesome Show as for his percussive skills). \u201cThey were constantly making spur-of-the-moment, funny videos,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cIt\u2019s their routine that they clearly do all the time: someone will say something humorous, and Jason will instantly document it. It was a lot of laughs.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFragmented World also represents Narducy\u2019s new artistic growth, as his peers and bandmates recognized immediately. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of Jason\u2019s work \u2013 it\u2019s classic late 20th-century pop music songwriting,\u201d Mould says. \u201cWe both share a real deep respect for popular music as an art form and its history \u2013 from The Who to The Beatles through Cheap Trick, punk rock, and all the things we\u2019ve done.\u201d \u201cI love the record \u2013 it sounds like a band playing together, which is something I don\u2019t hear a lot recently,\u201d Wurster says. \u201cJason is a fan of great songwriters like Pete Townshend, Lennon & McCartney, Bob Mould, Robert Pollard, and Strummer & Jones, so it would only be natural that he\u2019d write such well-crafted, memorable pop songs.\u201d \u201cI know that if people appreciate what I do, then they\u2019re going to appreciate what Jason does, because we all do the same things,\u201d Grohl notes. \u201cWe write songs that mean something and play them as fucking best as we can, with everything we have.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe material on Fragmented World ultimately spans the breadth of Narducy\u2019s history, while artfully exploring a gamut of styles and emotions in ways he\u2019s never approached before. \u201cNever Look Back\u201d and the title track, for example, evoke the entire legacy of power-pop in short, sharp blasts. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of early Cheap Trick in the song \u2018Fragmented World\u2019 \u2013 along with Nick Lowe, The Beatles, Big Star, Guided By Voices,\u201d Narducy says. \u201cI laugh when I hear it; I could probably go through every part and tell you what song it came from. The short arrangement is very Pollard, and the guitar solo very Doug Gillard. You can\u2019t help touring with great songwriters like Mould, and Pollard, and Superchunk and not learn something about songwriting!\u201d \u201cMonolith,\u201d meanwhile, updates Narducy\u2019s punk roots: \u201cIt\u2019s a snarl song \u2013 the record needed a little piss and vinegar.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere, Split Single songs like \u201cWaiting For The Sun\u201d and \u201cSearches\u201d ring out as updated tributes to the golden age of indie that inspired Narducy\u2019s evolution as a musician \u2013 blending melancholy vocals and chiming psychedelic jangle with more jagged post-punk influences. \u201cThere is something about those songs that reminds me of the \u201880s \u2013 those kind of hooky R.E.M. choruses mixed with the darkness of The Wipers,\u201d Narducy says. \u201c\u2018Searches\u2019 is one of my favorites,\u201d adds Daniel. \u201cIt\u2019s got a moody melody, but lots of nervous energy \u2013 the way those Wipers\u2019 songs were still pop songs, but there was something so dark and heavy about them.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs such, songs like \u201cMy Eyes\u201d and \u201cLast Goodbye\u201d reflect the passages that Narducy has gone through of late \u2013 from losing a loved one to cancer to the passing of his best friend from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it until we were mixing the record, but there\u2019s a real theme of loss here,\u201d Narducy says. \u201cA lot of things happened to me, and that inevitably came in. Even during the poppiest, lightest moments, the lyrics can be really dark.\u201d \u201cJason\u2019s life is different now, and from when he was writing music before: playing other people\u2019s music, having children, starting businesses \u2013 all that \u2018behind\u2019 stuff that makes us who we are as musicians,\u201d Mould says. \u201cHe\u2019s gone through a big growth process, learning and working alongside peers in a supporting role, complementing what we write, and now he\u2019s back writing his own music. He\u2019s got a different perspective than he had years ago. He\u2019s always been an amazing musician, with an amazing voice, and a great ability to pick a moment. When he\u2019s singing his thoughts, it\u2019s very strong and unique \u2013 but now it\u2019s more mature, more developed.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThen again, Narducy\u2019s output has had a long time to evolve: he\u2019s been writing songs since he became a pre-teen sensation on Chicago\u2019s \u201880s punk scene. Growing up in the Chicago suburb of Evanston \u2013 the unlikely spawning ground of bands like Big Black, Urge Overkill, and The Effigies \u2013 Narducy co-founded the group Verb\u00f6ten at age 11. Inspired by the Misfits, Circle Jerks, Sex Pistols, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, and J.F.A., Verb\u00f6ten would play all-ages shows with the likes of Naked Raygun, recorded professional demos, and appeared on local television programs. \u201cIt was a unique moment,\u201d Narducy says. \u201cMy dad liked classic rock, but punk was our music. I was like, \u2018This is mine \u2013 I get this.\u2019\u201d Verb\u00f6ten even made a fan out of the irascible Steve Albini, who praised the group in his column \u201cTired of Ugly Fat?,\u201d published in the important Midwestern fanzine Matter. \u201cVerb\u00f6ten were a pretty cool little band,\u201d Albini recalled to author Paul Brannigan in his biography This Is A Call: The Life and Times of Dave Grohl.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nGrohl, in fact, is another of Verb\u00f6ten\u2019s high-profile early adopters. Grohl\u2019s cousin, Tracey, was Verboten\u2019s charismatic singer; during one summer visit to Evanston, she took him on a tour of the Chicago punk universe, culminating in him watching a Verb\u00f6ten basement rehearsal \u2013 promptly blowing the 13-year-old Grohl\u2019s mind, and altering the path of his life forever. \u201cTracey said, \u2018I have a band of my own, and I was like, \u2018Really? What covers do you play?\u2019\u201d Grohl remembers. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018We write our own songs.\u2019 And it just blew my mind: I played guitar in a cover band, and I\u2019d sort of written songs of my own, but I\u2019d never dare ask someone to play them \u2013 you didn\u2019t do that when you were 13! But she was a punk rock singer, and her band was writing their own material, playing their own shows, and had gone to a studio and made a demo tape. I met Jason when I watched them practice. He had a Gibson SG \u2013 the AC/DC guitar! \u2013 but was such a shrimp it made the guitar look huge. They were fucking children: it was so nuts, because we were around the same age, yet they were completely their own little independent band. Seeing someone else do that made me realize it was possible, and inspired me to do it myself. I thought, \u2018If that kid right there does it, then I can do it, too!\u2019 After that, I came back to my crappy little suburb and was like, \u2018Hey, guys \u2013 I\u2019m punk rock, motherfuckers! Eat shit!\u2019 And when I bumped into Jason 20 years later, that\u2019s when I realized, more than any records I listened to, or heroes I had \u2013 he\u2019s actually the one who inspired me to do stuff on my own.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThose worlds collided anew when Narducy toured with Grohl, with Bob Mould serving as the support act on a number of Foo Fighters shows in 2012. \u201cBob Mould has the greatest band,\u201d Grohl says. \u201cAnd from that connection \u2013 I\u2019d known Jason for years, I\u2019d met Jon with Superchunk in the late \u201880s, and Bob being one of my heroes, of course \u2013 I just felt at home around them.\u201d \u201cDave\u2019s just so generous with the spotlight,\u201d Narducy says. \u201cHe\u2019s the most graceful rock star I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMould, meanwhile, first encountered Narducy at a sound check in 1991, while doing a series of acoustic solo concerts in Chicago. \u201cWe talked for a while about music, and he gave me a tape of some of his songs,\u201d Mould says. \u201cI took them home and listened to them, and they were really great.\u201d Mould quickly started having Jason & Alison \u2013 the acclaimed duo Narducy had formed with cellist Alison Chesley \u2013 open shows for him. Jason & Alison eventually transformed into the full-fledged four-piece rock group Verbow, and Mould was tapped to produce Verbow\u2019s Epic Records\u2019 debut, Chronicles, in 1997. \u201cI got to see Jason\u2019s abilities,\u201d Mould says. \u201cWe worked well together, and got to be closer friends.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter releasing two full-lengths and touring with everyone from Frank Black to Morrissey, Verbow officially broke up in 2003. That year, Narducy did a short promotional tour playing alongside Liz Phair, but it was Mould who truly kickstarted Narducy\u2019s status as star sideman. \u201cI\u2019d stepped away from playing rock music live for about seven years, and when I came back in 2005, that was the perfect opportunity for us to work together,\u201d Mould says. \u201cIt was the rebirth of me as the rock guy again, so I needed good support, and Jason was the key to it. He\u2019s a really good sounding board, and there are a lot of similarities in how we look at music. Over our 9 years together, it\u2019s gotten easier and easier.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe release of Fragmented World isn\u2019t the end of Narducy\u2019s current spate of activity: a touring version of Split Single will be playing shows in 2014 (the group already opened a series of Midwestern dates for Divine Fits this past April). According to Narducy, the format and lineup are designed to morph with whatever changes come down the pike. \u201cThe idea is to always play with friends, and keep things as portable as possible,\u201d he says. Narducy continues to be an active member of Bob Mould\u2019s band and Superchunk\u2019s touring unit, of course \u2013 but more original music from him will inevitably appear on the horizon. \u201cOne of the great things about Jason is that he\u2019s a lifer,\u201d Grohl says. \u201cI met him when he was just a little kid with an SG, writing and playing music because he was passionately driven to do it. He\u2019s always done it for that reason \u2013 and he\u2019s still doing it. When you see someone like him, it gives you faith in being a human being. In this day and age where you want music to be real, Jason\u2019s the real deal: he\u2019s got the craft, and he\u2019s trying to find the truth. He\u2019s one of the good ones, and the good ones last.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n- Matt Diehl\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-og.jpg\",\"width\":1440,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/52/23-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"//www.youtube.com/embed/LYKTI-HzWEE\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.splitsinglemusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/splitsingle\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/splitsingleband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"splitsingleband\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.dougfirlounge.com/event/1384346?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
