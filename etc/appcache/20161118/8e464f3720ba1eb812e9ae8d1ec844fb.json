Riley started playing guitar at age 10 and started writing music at age 14. He wrote his first song in 2007. \u201cEscalade\u201d, \u201cDream Girl\u201d and \u201cSandy Beaches\u201d, like many of his early songs, these were inspired by a young man\u2019s quest to get girls.\\r\\n \\r\\nOne of Riley\u2019s most inspiring songs, \u201cGod was in Bama This Year\u201d, was written about his experiences and observations following the April 27th, 2011 tornadoes that devastated Alabama. Many people identified with the lyrics and requested that Riley perform it at home dedications and memorial services during the following Years.  The opportunity to help his \u201cneighbors\u201d in their time of need is an honor that Riley took and takes Great Pride in.\\r\\n \\r\\n Riley spent many days and nights playing guitar and singing with his grandfather, Bufford Green.  Mr. Green opened a music hall in 2003, where the music goes from \u201cThe Bar Room to The Pulpit and back\u201d each Friday Night. Granddaddy-Buford taught Riley a love for the sound of Old Traditional Country, Bluegrass and Southern Gospel Music. Riley performed at the Golden Saw Music Hall, singing songs like \u201cWreck on the\\r\\nHighway\u201d & \u201cPrecious Jewel\u201d - by Roy Acuff, with his grandfather and other men of his generation. \u201cMy Best Friend\u201d was written as a tribute to his Granddaddy-Buford and the influence he had on Riley\u2019s life & music. Riley wrote \u201cLine in the Water\u201d, about fishing with his other grandfather, Granddaddy-Lendon, who also influenced him with his ability to\\r\\nTruly Relax and Enjoy the \u201cSouthern Lifestyle\u201d.\\r\\n \\r\\nMany of Riley\u2019s next generation of songs reflect on the experiences of a young southern man trying to find his place in the world. With a mixture of outlaw-rebellion and respect for tradition, Riley combined these values to create his own style. \u201cA Little Hank\u201d and \u201cAlmost\u201d reflect the battle of values in the \u201cSouthern Society\u201d and what his Grandfather referred to as \u201cThe fine line between Saturday night and Sunday Morning\u201d. Riley has played a variety of venues since hitting the road that include locations from \u201cSea to Tennessee\u201d as his line in \u201cBury Me in Dixie\u201d says. \\r\\n \\r\\nOutside of music, Riley always found time for athletics.  Riley, a three sport athlete in high school and a walk-on quarterback at Jacksonville State University understands the importance that comes from playing sports and being part of a team.  He continues to take great pride in both Alma Maters, and is always willing to help them when needed. \\r\\n \\r\\nRiley\u2019s Southern Roots show with his True Love of the Outdoors.  Besides being onstage, Riley\u2019s favorite place is being out in nature.  Riley, enjoys all types of hunting and fishing but has a passion for duck & turkey hunting.  One could say that Riley \u201cGoes from One Wildlife to another\u201d.   He and his dog Sadie enjoy spending time at his primitive hunting cabins in Jacksonville, AL and Arkansas.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":642,\"height\":415},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":642,\"height\":415},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":194},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":194},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":129},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":129},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-og.jpg\",\"width\":642,\"height\":415},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":65},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":65},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":323},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":323},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":642,\"height\":415},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/58/85-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":642,\"height\":415}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"uD6d6trCirI\",\"title\":\"Bury Me in Dixie\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uD6d6trCirI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uD6d6trCirI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.rileygreenmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/RileyGreenMusic/timeline\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1317161?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
