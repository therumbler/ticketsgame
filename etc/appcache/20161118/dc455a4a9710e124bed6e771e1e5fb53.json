Delivering anthemic harmonies, furious power chords, and larger-than-life melodies, the Philadelphia-based garage-punk four-piece amply fulfills that mission while achieving something much more deeply nuanced. With its delicately crafted storytelling and everyman romanticism, After the Partyultimately proves to be a wistful but life-affirming reflection on getting older but not quite growing up. \\\"   \\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent our 20s living in a rowdy kind of way, and now we' re at a point where it seems like everyone in our lives is moving in different directions,\\\" says Tom May, who joined fellow singer/guitarist Greg Barnett, bassist Eric Keen, and drummer Joe Godino in forming The Menzingers as teenagers in their hometown of Scranton. Adds Barnett: \\\"We're turning 30 now, and there's this idea that that's when real life comes on. In a way this album is us saying, 'We don't have to grow up or get boring\u2014we can keep on having a good time doing what we love.'\\\"   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Menzingers explore the tension between recklessness and responsibility all throughout After the Party, with the chorus to its opening track \\\" 20's (Tellin' Lies)\\\"   brashly asking \\\"Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?\\\" On lead single \\\"Lookers\\\"\u2014as in, \\\"You were such a looker in the old days\\\"\u2014the band pays loving tribute to their time spent in Asbury Park, weaving in memories of smoke-filled diners and Jersey-girl heartbreakers. Equally soaked in nostalgia, the bittersweet yet blistering \\\"Midwestern States\\\" offers what Barnett calls \\\"an ode to being in our early 20s and touring across the country for the first time, and just how eye-opening that all was for us.\\\"  On \\\"Bad Catholics,\\\" meanwhile, The Menzingers match their heavy riffs and high-powered rhythms with a gorgeously detailed narrative of running into a lost love at a hometown church picnic.  \\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Will Yip (Title Fight, Balance & Composure, Pianos Become the Teeth) and recorded in Yip's Conshohocken, Pennsylvania-based Studio 4, After the Party finds the band breaking into new sonic terrain, such as in the stripped-down reverie of \\\"   Black Mass\\\" and the drinking-song-inspired waltz of \\\"Bars.\\\" At the same time, The Menzingers bring that sharpened songcraft to the lyrical element of each track, with songs like \\\"Thick as Thieves\\\" candidly recounting their shared misadventures (\\\"   Building castles with cans and bottles/Drinking like they do in novels\\\"). And on \\\"   After the Party,\\\" the band spins poetry out of moments as mundane as listening to Minor Threat on a laptop, turning the track into a dreamy meditation on the innocence inherent in unabashed love of music (\\\"Everybody wants to get famous/But you just want to dance in a basement\\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nWith each song unfolding as its own fully realized story, After the Party came to life thanks largely to an introspective yet outward-looking lyrical sensibility on the part of Barnett and May. \\\"I take notes on pretty much everything I see and experience\u2014things that my friends say or my family members say, things that I see or read,\\\" says Barnett. \\\"And then when I go to write, I go back to those notes and try to think about what they meant, and then build something from there.\\\"   Working in a similar way, May points out that \\\"a lot of my songs come from things I took down in the notepad on my phone when I was out at night and then came back to months and months later.\\\" The Menzingers'  most refined album to date, After the Party was also shaped from an intensive writing and pre-production process that involved holing up for five weeks in Yip's studio. Along with sculpting more expansive arrangements, the band focused on experimenting with new effects and production techniques to forge the album's dynamic but intricately textured sound. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Party' s sophisticated yet emotionally raw songwriting also owes much to The Menzingers' broadening their palette of influences in recent years. May, for instance, mined inspiration from the off-kilter song structure of Regina Spektor. \\\"   Listening to her made me realize that you can go in with an idea and build the song around that, without it really having to go anywhere in particular,\\\" he notes. Barnett, on the other hand, found himself swayed by their bus driver's constant spinning of Meat Loaf'    s Bat Out of Hell on a summer 2015 tour of Europe. \\\"You can say what you want about Meat Loaf, but his ability to craft catchy melodies is absolutely insane, where there'    s ten of the strongest melodies ever written all just in one song,\\\" says Barnett. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the making of After the Party, The Menzingers also returned to longtime influences like The Clash, who were key to carving out their sound in the band's early days. Formed in 2006, The Menzingers made their debut with 2007's A Lesson in the Abuse of Information Technology and relocated to Philly in 2008. Over the years, the band steadily built up a devoted fanbase and\u2014in 2012\u2014saw their highly acclaimed Epitaph debut On The Impossible Past voted Album of the Year by Absolute Punk and Punk News. In 2014 they put out their fourth album Rented World, praised as \\\"   driving-around-with-the-windows-down music, ready for maximum blasting\\\"    by Pop Matters and \\\"   one of the best pop punk albums\\\"    of the year by Blurt. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor The Menzingers, the emotional depth attained on After the Party took years of determination and perseverance. \\\"When I was younger, I don't think I had the ability to experience how cathartic making music is to me now, even though I've always had so much passion for it,\\\" says May. With May adding that \\\"it's really reaffirming and amazing that we've been able to create an existence out of all this,\\\" The Menzingers are quick to note that the album was also born from a certain newfound sense of ease and freedom. \\\"In the past our records have tended to come from some kind of struggle, like from being broke or going through hard times,\\\"says Barnett. \\\"   This record really came from enjoying life and enjoying the friendships we'    ve formed with each other\u2014we had so much fun throughout the whole writing and recording process, and I think you can really feel that in the songs.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-og.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":853},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/19-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCcZ9_1-uDw\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://themenzingers.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/themenzingers\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/themenzingers\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/themenzingers\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"themenzingers\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1332679,\"name\":\"Jeff Rosenstock\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"7/23/2016\\r\\n11:37 PM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s almost midnight on a Saturday in the summer, and I live in New York City. I\u2019m still in my 30s and I don\u2019t have to get up early tomorrow. By anyone\u2019s standards, I should be heading out for the night; dancing, drinking, meeting up with old friends, making new friends, making mistakes, and feeling young in a city that allows you to remain young despite your age growing higher. I should be out there living.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, I just put a load of laundry in the machine in my building\u2019s basement. I\u2019m wearing a pair of green shorts and I feel like an asshole in them. I have knobby knees and shorts don\u2019t look good on me. I am wearing a light green t\u00adshirt and the whole outfit makes me vaguely feel like a middle\u00ad aged man dressed up for his first day of kindergarten. I am going nowhere tonight, and I suspect this may apply in the long term as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seems like the perfect time to write about Jeff Rosenstock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause no one I\u2019ve ever met creates art that encapsulates this state of mind more than Jeff. It\u2019s music that\u2019s catchier than any other music, music you can scream along to in a joyous frenzy. But simultaneously, if you really listen to the lyrics you\u2019re shouting, they can speak to a loneliness and desperation so profound it\u2019s soul crushing. I\u2019ve lost myself in joy to Jeff\u2019s songs and I\u2019ve sat alone depressed to Jeff\u2019s songs, and I\u2019ve felt both those things to the same song, sometimes on back to back listens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody can take the exhilaration and possibilities of life and balance them with the depression of a laundry room on a Saturday night like Jeff Rosenstock. His music can be like a funeral taking place inside a bouncy house, or like a kids\u2019 birthday party taking place inside a morgue. I say that with the utmost sincerity and the intent to offer only the highest of praise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\u2019re reading this, you probably know the legend of Jeff Rosenstock by now. The Arrogant Sons of Bitches had Long Island\u2019s attention, and then mutated into Bomb the Music Industry, a collection of musicians that were among the first to just give their music away, that spray painted t\u00adshirts for fans, that did everything in a way that was financially ill\u00adadvised and built a cult unlike any other in the process. Sometimes their shows had a dozen musicians on stage, sometimes it was Jeff and an ipod. No matter what, there was always one thing that remained the same \u2013 this\\r\\nband had as much integrity as Fugazi with none of the pretension but with all the emotion but with a lot more fun and also I have to reiterate none of the pretension. To me it seems like Bomb was like Fugazi if the members of Fugazi had been willing to let down their guards and laugh at fart jokes. Again, this is meant as high praise. I really like Fugazi and am not trying to talk shit, it\u2019s just an apt metaphor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Bomb ended, Jeff was left standing in a lonely spotlight and we all wondered if he\u2019d be ok. Instead of even giving us time to find out, he put out We Cool? and showed us all what growing up looks like. Growing up fucking sucks, but it\u2019s not for melodramatic reasons. It sucks because your joints start hurting and you know you probably aren\u2019t gonna get some of the things done that you\u2019ve always promised yourself you\u2019re gonna get done and you still have a lot of guilt about dumb shit you pulled when you were like 19. We Cool? showed us that Jeff Rosenstock\u2019s version of growing up wasn\u2019t going to betray Bomb or its fans or the things people loved about them, it was going to put a magnifying glass on his own impulses and insecurities as an individual in a way that was both shockingly frank and impossibly catchy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJeff\u2019s music, if you ask me, is for people who really and truly feel like they could change the world, if only they could muster up the strength to leave the fucking house. It\u2019s for people who get into group situations and have every instinct inside their heads scream that the world is a fucked up and terrifying place and they should crumble up into a corner and wait to die, but who instead dance like idiots because what the fuck else is there to do? It\u2019s music that makes me feel like maybe, just maybe, if I do things the right way I can help make the world a better place, while co\u00adexisting with the knowledge that I don\u2019t fucking matter and there\u2019s no reason not to give up, except maybe I shouldn\u2019t because what if deep down people are actually beautiful, giving, and kind?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s music that makes me lose myself like I used to when I was 13 and first discovered the joy of punk rock, but it\u2019s also music that makes me think way too fucking hard about why the world is how it is and if I might be someone with enough heart to throw a few punches in the effort to make shit just a tiny bit better for others for one fucking second of one fucking day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s simple punk rock. It\u2019s also complicated and beautiful and working class and perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIs the above a little cheesy? Sure. But I think it\u2019s true and I think it\u2019s all worth saying. Because having become friends with Jeff over the past few years, I can say the following with great certainty \u2013 he actually is what he says he is. And because of that, all the above applies. His integrity is untouchable. We all need to take a second and appreciate how much time this guy has wasted finding all ages venues. How much money he has passed on to retain his credibility as an artist. If other artists \u2013 myself chief among them \u2013 conducted themselves with an ounce of the integrity Jeff approaches all areas of art and life with, the world would be a better place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI know this might sound silly to people who don\u2019t get it \u2013 they might say \u201cIt\u2019s just punk rock, calm down.\u201d \u2013 but fuck those people, we all know Jeff is a musical genius. If he wanted to go ghost write songs for Taylor Mars and Bruno Swift, I bet he could make millions of dollars doing so. Music is easy for him. He could write empty songs and hand them off to hollow artists and we all know he\u2019d kill it and he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with shaking down shady promoters for a few hundred bucks or driving overnight to get to the next venue or stressing about paying bills or any of it. He continues to not do any of that easy shit and that\u2019s because he\u2019s not bullshitting about doing things not just the right way, but in a way that\u2019s more idealistic than reality actually allows for. He does that for us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guy is a genius poet while simultaneously being the definition of a fucking goon from Long\u200b Island. There is nothing not to love. The album you are about to listen to, WORRY., only furthers and exceeds the myth of Jeff Rosenstock, he who is mythical for being the most normal dude from a boring place any of us have ever met; mythical for sticking to his guns when all logic points in the other direction; mythical for writing melodies that stick in our brains and lyrics that rip our guts out; mythical most of all for being not mythical at all. He\u2019s just Jeff. It\u2019s not that complicated. But in a world where everything is driven by branding and image and hidden agendas, being not that complicated makes him perhaps the most complicated artist I know.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnjoy this album. Enjoy it as a whole. The second half is going to blow your mind with its ambitiousness \u2013 in my opinion the second half of this album will be viewed over time as a triumph and high water mark of a cool ass career. And the singles \u2013 \u201cWave Goodnight to Me\u201d \u200bis untouchable. \u201cBlast Damage Days\u201d will make you feel ok about the fact that the world seems to be built on a foundation of quicksand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when you\u2019re done listening, don\u2019t forget \u2013 you probably can\u2019t change the world, but you\u2019re kind of a dick if you don\u2019t at least try. Jeff\u2019s been falling on the sword for the rest of us for years and it\u2019s on all of us to at least go down swinging.\\r\\n\\r\\nSincerely,\\r\\nChris\u00a0Gethard\\r\\nPS\u00a0\u2013\u00a0John\u00a0DeDomenici\u00a0ain\u2019t\u00a0bad\u00a0either.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":644},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":201},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-og.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":858},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":335},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":436},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/22/29-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"Z300lqlmqN0\",\"title\":\"Jeff Rosenstock - We Begged 2 Explode\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z300lqlmqN0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"PHDUAOkR0TU\",\"title\":\"Jeff Rosenstock - I Did Something Weird Last Night\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHDUAOkR0TU\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z300lqlmqN0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/jeffrosenstockmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/jeffrosenstock\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"jeffrosenstock\"},{\"id\":1773732,\"name\":\"Rozwell Kid\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"There's a certain science when it comes to writing music that can evoke a sing-it-loud response from more than a few subsets of people, and Rozwell Kid might as well have their PhD. The West Virginian quartet has been proudly playing dials-to-ten indie alt-rock since 2011's matter-of-factly titled The Rozwell Kid LP. Their new LP Too Shabby shows off Rozwell Kid's progression as musicians that haven't lost any of their quirky charm...or volume. \\r\\n\\r\\nToo Shabby was engineered by Justin Francis at Ronnie's Place in Nashville in early 2014. By the time its 10 songs have concluded, it's obvious that Rozwell Kid have sharpened from their last release \u2013 an EP entitled Dreamboats \u2013 while somehow getting louder. With lyrics like those in the record's opener, Kangaroo Pocket, (\\\"Simpsons season 3 and a thing of hummus / This is all I need / I'm like super low maintenance\\\") Rozwell Kid find a paradoxical marriage between originality and familiarity. Too Shabby is proof that Jordan Hudkins, Adam L. Meisterhans, Devin Donnelly and Sean Hallock have emerged as a more cohesive, brave, and intelligent unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's undeniable that Too Shabby will draw comparisons to any pre-millenia Weezer record. It's as inevitable as Rozwell Kid is loud. It's more than that, though. Too Shabby is fun, infectious, kinetic, and its unmatched in that. With songs like Weirdo and Birthday Sombrero, Too Shabby has what it takes to be to 2034 what The Blue Album is to 2014. As for right now? Turn it up.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":719},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":225},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":150},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-og.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":959},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":75},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":375},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":487},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/09-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"QsS6u8246XY\",\"title\":\"Rozwell Kid - Unmacho (Official Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QsS6u8246XY\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"s_1JpybEMcU\",\"title\":\"Rozwell Kid - Magic Eye (Official Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s_1JpybEMcU\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QsS6u8246XY\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://rozwellkid.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/RozwellKid\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/rozwellkid\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"rozwellkid\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.treesdallas.com/event/1385327?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
