Ford\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"There are artists who can command attention. They lean into their songs with an irresistible edge and total emotional connection and stay there. Sallie Ford is one of those artists. On her fourth album, Soul Sick, Ford gathered her strengths, took them into Portland\u2019s Type Foundry studio along with producer Mike Coykendall (M Ward, She & Him) at the helm and created music that draws on all of her influences but still comes out her own. Looking at her life, there isn\u2019t much way it could have come out differently. And this is the album which proves it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSallie Ford grew up in Asheville, North Carolina in a musical family. At nineteen she moved to Portland, OR to explore her creative side which led to her career in music. Like all aspiring artists, there were enough twists and turns along with several serious dead ends, but Sallie persevered by creating songs that took those life challenges and turned them upside down into inspired music. Much of it is inspired by \u201860s music, whether it\u2019s the music of the British Invasion like the Kinks and the Troggs, or American groups Canned Heat and ? & the Mysterians. Add on other influences like girl groups the Shirelles, the Shangri- Las and the Ronettes, and the sound of Soul Sick comes into focus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Sallie describes, \u201cThis is a \u2018confessional\u2019 album. It\u2019s about struggling with my issues \u2013 some that I\u2019ve overcome and some that I still carry around.\u201d The album opens with the line, \u201cWoke up feeling sour on the sweetest summer day,\u201d which just about sums up Sallie Ford\u2019s state of mind a few years ago. A band breakup with the Sound Outside in 2013 led to new realizations about the things in her life that needed to change. As she jumped headfirst into those efforts, she signed with Vanguard Records, handpicked a new all-female backing band and released the debut album under her own name, 2014\u2019s Slap Back. It marked a big transition in Ford\u2019s sound, allowing her voice to take center stage amid a band sound of chugging distorted grit. It also gave her a new chance to take a stronger grip on her career and her personal life. With those deep shifts gave new questions, though, ones that weren\u2019t always easy to answer. \u201cI felt confused, down about life and unsure of myself,\u201d explains Ford.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn search of definitive answers, Sallie Ford began therapy, \u201cThis is an album about insecurity, anxiety and depression, especially after the Sound Outside and I split up and had my first summer in four years where I wasn\u2019t touring.\u201d Ford says. \u201cI was a middle child and a homeschooler, so I\u2019ve always felt like an outsider. I explored what my music means to me, and how I\u2019ve always struggled with feeling the pressure of not being good enough and wanting to quit. On these new songs, it felt good to write on one theme and from one place. All in all, Soul Sick has taught me a lot about myself and helped me to heal.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of that healing is captured in the actual music played on the album. It is laced with a lot of nostalgic feeling, and produced to enhance that essence. \u201cI asked Mike Coykendall (M. Ward and She & Him) to produce, Ford says. \u201cHe loves old rock & roll and always records on tape, but he\u2019s also an experimenter,\\r\\nexploring new things with his music. He\u2019s the most honest and genuine musician I\u2019ve met. This album is as much his creation as mine. It was spontaneous in a lot of ways, but also the best-crafted thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOne listen to Soul Sick attests to all those thoughts. Ford\u2019s vocals continue to mature, with less nuanced delivery and more belting clarity. Her vulnerability and \u201860s fusion have evolved her sound into new territory, but also provide a bridge for new and previous listeners. \u201cI think my biggest goal with this new album is to be relatable to what I originally started out as, as well as what I\u2019ve become,\u201d Ford says.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo matter how you approach Soul Sick, the only prognosis is: mission accomplished. With a new studio band including Garth Klippert (Old Light) and Kris Doty (Modern Kin) on board, the fire is there. Add on guest musicians Ben Nugent (Dolorean), Ralph Carney (Tom Waits, the B-52s), John Coykendall and Kirk Hamilton, and these 11 new songs stand as Sallie Ford\u2019s step into a new world. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even my goal at first to write these songs, it was more like \u2018I want to write about struggling with my demons.\u2019 But it became something more. I felt like some of that negativity I was able to write about with a positive light after the fact.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSOUL SICK \\r\\nFEBRUARY 10, 2017\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/64/49-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.sallieford.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/sallieford\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/salliefordmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/salliefordmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"salliefordmusic\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1371849?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
