Then Joey Banducci soon joined on drums and they stayed as a two piece 4 months then gained Josh on bass and Clayton Cagle on guitar. This line up lasted till March of 2011 and Clayton was let go from the band. By this time the band was beginning to do shows more often and had began to develop their sound. For a short time Jimmy Hill of Necrosin had joined for a short time, but wanted to put his priorities toward Necrosin and quit. Hemotoxin continued as a 3 piece and by this time had already released two demos and travelled to LA. After staying a 3 piece, young Hunter Farrand had offered his talents and was added to the band. Then in mid September after forming and being in the band for over a year, Joey quit and very soon after Brandon Wilcox filled his spot and has now become a very vital part of this band. Now you have the band as it is now, still very active. In February of 2012 Hemotoxin released their latest release Divinity in Torture. Through early 2012 the band would solidify themselves in the bay area metal scene with bands like Short Fuse, ZH, Feast, Hatchet, and more. In the summer of 2012 the band released a home recorded demo featuring new sing \\\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\\\". That same summer the band would return to socal for 3 dates with Deceive and Necrosin as well as playing with such bands as Skoffin, Severed Savior, Arkaik, Fiar, Monolith, Through these Gates, Hexen, Bonded by Blood and more! Then to close off the summer the band was featured on the pedal powered stage at Slaughter by the Water 3, featuring bands such as Exodus, Absu, Abysmal Dawn and more. As the fall of 2012 approached the band began writing for a new album, at the same time the band was also signed to local record label \\\"Devastated Records\\\" and plan on releasing their debut album \\\"Between Forever...and the End\\\". Now as the band continues to play and build themselves as a premier death metal act of the San Francisco Bay area, more and more the band are beginning to reach further horizons and tearing apart cities all around the San Francisco bay area and beyond!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/46/06/29-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":293},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/46/06/29-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/46/06/29-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":196},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/46/06/29-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/46/06/29-og.jpg\",\"width\":716,\"height\":700},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/46/06/29-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":98},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/46/06/29-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/46/06/29-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/46/06/29-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/46/06/29-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":489},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/46/06/29-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://hemotoxin70.bandcamp.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/Hemotoxin\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":630825,\"name\":\"dismembered carnage\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Gore grinding brutal death metal coming from Concord/Antioch California.
