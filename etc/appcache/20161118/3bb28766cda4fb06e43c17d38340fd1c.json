and Glory\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\u201cI\u2019ve been going wild, like the river runs. And I\u2019m afraid that this rambling has only just begun.\u201d So sings Ward Hayden, singer/songwriter of Girls Guns and Glory, on the band\u2019s new album Sweet Nothings (Lonesome Day, 2011). These words, found in the song \u201cSnakeskin Belt,\u201d are an apt introduction to the band itself. Girls Guns and Glory is a celebration of sweet and tasty, fun lovin\u2019 and hard timin\u2019, honky tonk music that is simultaneously casual and complex. The band combines elements of early rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, country, and rhythm & blues to deliver its own brand of American Roots music that satisfies like homemade apple pie.\\r\\n\\r\\nGirls Guns and Glory is the brainchild of Lonesome Day recording artist Ward Hayden. Hayden formed GGG in the Winter of 2005 and within 2 weeks of the groups formation they entered Noise in the Attic Studios to begin a prolific period of recording. Releasing 3 critically acclaimed full-length albums in as many years (Fireworks & Alcohol \u2013 2006; Pretty Little Wrecking Ball \u2013 2007; Inverted Valentine \u2013 2008). Hayden\u2019s original compositions conjure the palpable ache of a crushed heart; they touch on themes of love lost and hope found, and their words alone could be published in anthologies of poetry. Hayden recalls that once he got on stage with GGG, he found he had never felt more comfortable doing anything else. Performing quickly became an addiction, and it is due in part to his efforts on and off stage that GGG is now an internationally touring band, named Independent Artist of the Year at the French Country Music Awards, and two-time winner of both the Roots Act of Year (Boston Phoenix Awards) and Americana Act of the Year (Boston Music Awards). GGG is also the only band of its genre to ever take home the top honors of Act of the Year (Boston Music Awards) and to win the legendary WBCN Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Rumble.\\r\\n\\r\\nHayden, who originally hails from Scituate, MA, leads the band on Vocals and Acoustic Guitar. And after full shake up of the line up in 2009, the solidified group that helps him create their sound is a band of Pennsylvania transplants who made their way to Boston to further their musical pursuits: Chris Hersch on Electric Guitar, Michael Calabrese on Drums/Vocals, and Paul Zaz Dilley on Upright/Electric Bass. They are a well-trained group: Hersch and Calabrese went to the New England Conservatory of Music and Dilley attended Berklee College of Music. With the demands of a heavy-touring lifestyle, this is a group that cut its teeth on the road, and their resulting chemistry on stage is enjoyably electric. Hayden is quick to mention that, not only do these guys play their focal instruments with mastery, appreciation, and\u2014on occasion\u2014spirited abandon, each one of them is a multi-instrumentalist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another life, Hayden might have become a fisherman or even a marine biologist. He loves the outdoors and has a special affinity for aquatic life and for the solitude that being out on the water, alone with his thoughts, can bring. His other main interest is in collecting vintage clothes and decor. As a boy, he spent a lot of time with his grandmother, who was a flea market vendor. To this day, looking at the objects he has amassed in his personal collection fills him with a sense of nostalgia. It\u2019s really no wonder that Hayden says he feels most at home surrounded by things from another era, as you get the sense listening to some of his songs that he was transported to his current residence in Cambridge, MA from another time and place where long-fringed leather jackets and white-tailed deer foot lamps were the norm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of survival, sometimes conveyed by quiet presence, at other times more in-your-face, pervades Hayden\u2019s personal interests and his music. The ocean can be churned up and swirling on one day and calm and placid the next; but every day when you rise, it is there. Your oldest possessions may be scuffed and worn and maybe even a little worse for wear, but their mere presence asserts that they are still here. Likewise, even Hayden\u2019s most gut-wrenching songs about heartbreak have a triumphalist flair. To any of the girls out there that this may apply to: you may have given him something to sing about, but you didn\u2019t get him down for long.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Hayden, the band has just begun to scratch the surface of what they can do with their 4th full-length studio release: Sweet Nothings. Hersch stretches out on baritone guitar and Fender Six, Calabrese contributes harmony vocals and a myriad of percussive instrumentation, and Dilley rocks the mellotron. And listen for Sarah Borges (Sarah Borges & the Broken Singles) as she lends her voice to the Hayden-penned duet \u201c1,000 Times.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a band that spends much of its time on the road, the up-shot is they love what they\u2019re doing. This is a band that has John Prine sing-a-longs in their primary tour vehicle, a Ford E-350 dubbed \u201cThe Road Hawk.\u201d For new fans looking for a conversation-starter: each of the band members has a hawk nickname, which they will probably explain to you if you ask them nicely. Hayden states, \u201cOne of the greatest joys of the road has been meeting so many people from so many different walks of life\u201d and he credits the hospitality of GGG\u2019s fans with helping them to get from square one to across the Atlantic Ocean. Hayden says, \u201cMusic has been our ticket to see the country and beyond. It\u2019s largely due to the kindness of people we\u2019ve met who\u2019ve housed and fed us and taken us in for the night that\u2019s enabled us to continue our pursuit of creating music and being touring musicians.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHayden speaks about the release of the Paul Q. Kolderie (Radiohead, Uncle Tupelo, Lemonheads) and Adam Taylor (Sarah Borges, Portugal The Man) produced Sweet Nothings as a rebirth of sorts. For him, it is a reconnection to the roots of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll for which he exhumed influences of the past including Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, The Everly Brothers, Roy Orbison, Buddy Holly, and Little Richard. The album, which has songs both quick and catchy about the simple pleasures in life and slow and sentimental about\u2014what else?\u2014getting your heart ripped out, chewed up, spit out, and pieced back together, is a masterful follow-up to the band\u2019s earlier endeavors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would drive someone to leave the comforts of home and the stability of a 9-5 job with a steady paycheck? For Hayden and the other men of Girls Guns and Glory, it\u2019s the pursuit of artistic expression. They hold the goal of creating something that\u2019s at once accessible and full of depth. Who hasn\u2019t stayed too long at the dance hoping that special someone would look their way? Who hasn\u2019t called one last time, even though they knew it was the wrong decision? When Girls Guns and Glory takes the stage they\u2019re there to play their hearts out and capture in song those experiences with genuine honesty and naked emotion. Give Girls Guns and Glory a listen and come see these boys when they\u2019re out on the road. This party has started and this is your open invitation.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":590,\"height\":303},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":590,\"height\":303},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":154},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":154},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":103},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":103},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-og.jpg\",\"width\":590,\"height\":303},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":51},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":51},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":257},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":257},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":590,\"height\":303},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/85/06/99-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":590,\"height\":303}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"DexY6GHLGhg\",\"title\":\"Girls, Guns and Glory - Snakeskin Belt (Live from Rhythm & Roots 2011)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DexY6GHLGhg\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DexY6GHLGhg\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.girlsgunsandglory.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/girlsgunsandglory\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/girlsgunsglory\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"girlsgunsglory\"},{\"id\":1730483,\"name\":\"Kelsey Waldon\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Thinking about country music, Kelsey Waldon muses, \\\"If it's a part of who you are, it's a part of who you are.\\\" And country music is very much a part of who she is, a part of who she's always been. The Kentucky singer/songwriter hails from Monkey's Eyebrow, in rural Ballard County where her family put down roots several generations ago. Even so, Waldon's musical tastes reach well beyond those borders, as evidenced on her new release, I've Got a Way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaldon was 13 when her parents divorced and, inspired by the music surrounding her, she started playing guitar as a means to make it through her teen years. Upon her arrival in Music City a few years later, Waldon toiled away 45+ hours a week in a minimum wage job and played gigs in any bar that would let her in the door and on the stage. Once she had a pocket full of songs, she released her debut album in 2014, The Goldmine. The set was met with open arms from both critics and lovers of the kind of country music that she makes \u2014 the kind born in bars and raised in honky-tonks, the kind leaning on pedal steel and driven by Telecaster. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs solid as the effort was, its follow-up isn't just a next step, it's a forward leap. After all, when you're a songwriter, a couple of years can contain a lifetime of lessons. And that wisdom is what seeps through on her sophomore effort which, like The Goldmine, was produced by Michael Rinne. For Waldon, \\\"It's a transition in letting go and also being absolutely comfortable in your own skin.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the newfound confidence and compassion with which she inhabits her place in the world comes through loud and clear on original cuts like \\\"All by Myself,\\\" \\\"Don't Hurt the Ones (Who've Loved You the Most),\\\" and \\\"Life Moves Slow,\\\" as well as her arrangements of Vern and Rex Gosdin's \\\"There Must Be a Someone\\\" and Bill Monroe's \\\"Traveling Down This Lonesome Road.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps because it was one of the first songs Waldon wrote this go-around,\\\"All By Myself,\\\" in particular, stands out as something of a thesis statement for the rest of the album, if not for life, in general. As she explains, \\\"It is not a lecture, or a sermon, or a statement from me. I want it to be a statement for everyone, as a whole: The power is only inside of ourselves.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause no country record would be complete without a proper kiss-off cut, Waldon scratched out her own entry in that milieu with \\\"You Can Have It.\\\" That kind of personal empowerment comes up time and again across I've Got a Way. In \\\"Let's Pretend,\\\" that power emerges through the act of focusing on the good and choosing the kind as part of what Waldom describes as \\\"a 'Storms Never Last' mentality\\\" to relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing the collection are \\\"Traveling Down This Lonesome Road,\\\" which stands as her hard-edged hat tip to Bill Monroe and the music she grew up on, and \\\"The Heartbreak,\\\" which shows she can deliver a weeper, to boot. But this isn't the standard woe-is-me fare. Here, too, is a message of empowerment and empathy. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, how does Waldon turn her messages into the country music that is so much a part of her? \\\"Lay it all out, and sing it from the heart, way down deep,\\\" she says. \\\"If you do it that way, you don't need gimmicks.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/37/87-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"M42dt2LuG-k\",\"title\":\"The Attic Sessions || Kelsey Waldon\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M42dt2LuG-k\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"CKd7RF2wRrI\",\"title\":\"Kelsey Waldon - All By Myself (Official Music Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKd7RF2wRrI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"nomsM_gKE2I\",\"title\":\"Kelsey Waldon - \\\"High in Heels\\\"\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nomsM_gKE2I\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M42dt2LuG-k\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://kelseywaldon.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"https://myspace.com/kelseywaldon\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/kelseywaldonmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/kelsey_waldon\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"kelsey_waldon\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1335787?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
