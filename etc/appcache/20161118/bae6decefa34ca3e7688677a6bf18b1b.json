Gainsbourg\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Four years ago, Lulu Gainsbourg launched his career with a wonderful gift for his father who passed away twenty years before. The musician imagined a stunning album of covers, on which he brought together Vanessa Paradis, Iggy Pop, Scarlett Johansson, Marianne Faithfull, Johnny Depp and Rufus Wainwright among others. Entitled From Gainsbourg to Lulu, this album was a prerequisite step before he could take off as a solo artist. \u201cAt first, it was important for me to pay tribute to my father\u2019s work. I also wanted his songs to be known in other countries. But to remain the son who indefinitely revisits my dad\u2019s repertoire was out of question. I did not want to go on tour with that record, I was already thinking about my own personal project.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most dedicated listeners will remember that on that first record the Lulu let them catch a glimpse of his own work through the original track Fresh News from the Stars. Now he is releasing twelve songs under the name of Lady Luck, his first album with original compositions inspired by events from his private life. \u201cLady Luck was born after a difficult break up. I sat down and started playing the piano to share my emotions.\u201d  To do so, Lulu dedicated himself to specific rules, composing and arranged all the songs himself. He draws from his own experience for the lyrics, and, determined to sing in English, he decided to work with American writers. A logical choice for someone who spent several years abroad between London (where he currently lives), New York, Los Angeles and Boston where he attended the prestigious Berklee College of Music.\\r\\n\\r\\nLulu was invested in every step of the creative process for his album, so he called upon a few incredible musicians to join him in the studio including Paul Turner and Derrick Mckenzie, Jamiroquai\u2019s bassist and drummer, as well as Drew McConnell from the Babyshambles. To produce the album, he renewed his collaboration with Jeremy Loucas, whose work with Terri Lyne Carrington and Esperanza Spalding earned him Grammy awards over the past few years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdded to this team are some prestigious guests: Matthieu Chedid and his brother contributed to the single Lady Luck. Anne Hathaway and the artist Ara Starck (daughter of  designer Philippe Starck) joined Lulu on the album\u2019s two duets: The Cure for Anne, and It\u2019s Always Something for Ara. \u201cAnne expressed her fondness for my first album in an interview. I contacted her to thank her, later on we had lunch together and a few months down the road we had the duet ready. She is truly a beautiful person and a very talented vocalist.  And as for Ara, she\u2019s always been like a older sister to me.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nArmed with these collaborators, the recording took place between New York and London. In the British capital\u2019s Metropolis Studio, Lulu notably found himself playing on Freddie Mercury\u2019s original piano.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the numerous guests on Lady Luck, Lulu gives us a very intimate and sincere record. With modesty, the young man opens a dialogue with his parents: he addresses his mother in the  beautiful freudian ballad Moushka, and speaks to his father on Destiny, a title with a disarming text, for which he composed very Gainsbourgesque arrangements. Musically speaking, the album Lady Luck continues to reflect the eclecticism and the open-mindedness of its author, oscillating between sexy funk (Lady Luck), pop (Love on the Rocks), atmospheric ballads (Moushka) and refined instrumentals (in particular the delicate Lily Rose, composed for Vanessa Paradis and Johnny Depp\u2019s daughter).\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI like the diversity, I did not want to give a single tone to this album. I\u2019m inspired by Coldplay as well as Miles Davis, The Rolling Stones as much as Michael Jackson.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBrought out by a sharp sense of melody, the compositions are adorned with delicate and soft arrangements, often giving them a cinematographic charm. As the first real chapter of Lulu\u2019s solo musical history, this Lady Luck is a promise for a bright future. \u201cIt was hard to make a name for myself. I was criticized, and maybe there was some jealousy, too. On my side, I do not judge the others. All I know is that I have been behind a piano since I was four. I worked hard, I never gave up. Music is my whole life. I hope this record will help me become Lulu.\u201d Something to look forward to.\\r\\n\\r\\nLulu is currently working on his third album which will be release in late 2017.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":559,\"height\":723},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":388},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":259},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-og.png\",\"width\":559,\"height\":723},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":129},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":647},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atxl1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atxxl.png\",\"width\":559,\"height\":723},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/16/67-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://thecuttingroomnyc.ticketfly.com/event/1334345?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
