But she knew there were songs, and they had to get out. Six even years since her critically acclaimed Welder, as well as much personal tumult, there were songs that needed to be born. \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIf anything, (Exodus) is a pledge of allegiance for the bad girls and the Homecoming Queens who got caught in a scandal. It\u2019s a bill of rights, and a testimony for those good girls who got away with more than they should have.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m slow, and getting slower,\u201d laughs the lanky blond, unapologetically. \u201cI\u2019m taking my time, really drilling down. There were nine versions of \u2018Methadone Blues.\u2019 I\u2019ve never done that before. I love that entrenchment and dedication \u2013 and I wasn\u2019t going to do any less than what needed to be done.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Dexter Green's (also the album's producer) opening electric guitar, equal parts foreboding and fraught, \u201cExodus of Venus\u201d hurls a churlish witness to erotic upheaval and the drives that subsume our best notions.  \u201cExodus\u201d is an exhortation of sexual surrender that pushes past the brink of reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nFor fans of the Florida-born\u2019n\u2019raised Cook, a Grand Ole Opry regular, SiriusXM Outlaw Country hostess and David Letterman favorite, Exodus of Venus will be something of a shock. If she maintains the tang of her drawl, what emerges \u2013 beyond Cook\u2019s always vibrant and vivid sense of detail \u2013 is a song cycle soaked in turpentine, musk and honey.\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the sweltering tumble of B-3 on the funky, shuffling \u201cMethadone Blues\u201d to the elegiac dignity of \u201cTabitha Tuder\u2019s Mama\u201d and the Velvet Underground on fire bristle of \u201cBrokedown in London on the M25,\u201d Cook\u2019s shouldering a deeper passion for the state of living today \u2013 and the crashing into the wall reality we all go through. If in the past Cook relied on wit and a certain dogpatch charm, Venus commands a raw knuckled truth that\u2019s even more searing.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a lot to laugh about,\u201d confesses the effervescent songwriter who once penned \u201cIt Takes Balls To Be A Woman\u201d with equal parts Dolly Parton pluck and Loretta Lynn brio. \u201cThings have been heavy and dark, and I feel really different. I aspire to be more than clever or dark or poignant, but to be honest. I want that to supersede everything.\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cEmotionally, mentally, physically \u2013 it\u2019s all been tested,\u201d she continues, \u201cand it set me up straight. It was hard, but it\u2019s a good thing. Really hard lessons in resilience... All of it is in the record.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nThat resilience rises like steam from the narcotic \u201cDyin\u2019,\u201d as Cook professes her by any means necessary strength, \u201cGonna be a diamond, gonna make hay/ If you don\u2019t like it, gonna do it anyway/ Gonna put on the  pistols, gonna cause a scene/ Gonna goddamn save the queen...\u201d Flowing from there to the attenuated starkly haunted \u201cEvacuation,\u201d a slow build of defiance that eschews the easy for holding onto one\u2019s roots \u2013 and casting a parallel with New Orleans\u2019 own spirit that mines a deep desire to live, die and celebrate where one\u2019s essence lies.\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cDuring the years when family was dying and houses were burning down and I was in divorce court and David Letterman was calling and doing shows with Anthony Bourdain, the whiplash was almost too much,\u201d Cook admits. \u201cTo keep up with all this great stuff, while I\u2019d been sheltered for such a long time from tragedy, it transforms you. It really does.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nCook emerged a tougher, wiser woman. If her years as a rough stock Minnie Pearl, part comedienne, part chronicler of life beyond the urban hipeoisie, had cast her first glass of champagne ebullience as a sparkling presence of hillbilly authenticity, Exodus of Venus suggests a woman tapping into the force of her true power. Frank, stumbling, angry, exhausted, triumphant, she owns the ragged edges, the torn seams and worn thin places.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nJoined by hard country soul singer Patty Loveless on \u201cStraight Jacket Love,\u201d she catcalls a frantic surrender, \u201cOn and off the wagon/Lighting fire to grease/Knives are made for stabbing/Arms are made for peace...\u201d as the CMA Female Vocalist maintains perfect mountain harmony. \u201cI blind emailed her management, fingers crossed \u2013 because I heard her voice all over this record \u2013 then sent her two or three songs, saying, \u2018This is my record. If you hear anything...\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cShe honed right in on \u2018Straight Jacket Love.\u2019 Maybe it felt like some real dark Appalachian kind of thing. She has such authentic texture and power when she sings. She shows me what I\u2019m trying to do...\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nNot that Cook needs any teaching. A kid singer in her late-in-life parents\u2019 country music aspirations, she learned bar life early \u2013 and getting by with a pretty smile and a good line. Her mother \u2013 diagnosed with uterine cancer at 42 while pregnant with Elizabeth \u2013 and \u201craging alcoholic Daddy\u201d had big plans. \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m the miracle child sent to heal my father, and I was bewildered by that. I was a princess, but the king was a monster. And if things weren\u2019t okay, I was failing.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter years of getting by on charm, with dysfunction part of the family\u2019s functionality, it all came apart in Cook\u2019s hands. But in the wreckage of death and divorce, Cook found liberation and emancipation. \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be the good girl anymore, and that brought some joy to all of it. I almost care more \u2013 or different,\u201d she explains. \u201cThese songs are more poignant. They\u2019re honest, and all about compassion or grace. For myself, and from a place of experience. Not that any of it was wrong, but I look back and have pride for all that happened and what I\u2019ve survived.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOn \u201cCutting Diamonds,\u201d Cook tosses the declaration \u201cShe has no line on polished pearls/Those are for the proper girls...\u201d like confetti. Then on the kick\u2019n\u2019snare\u2019n\u2019piano roll underscored \u201cOrange Blossom Trail,\u201d she kicks up a bit of savory dust, with the celebratory toast, \u201cPlayers talk while Thieves set sail/It\u2019s the fragrant air of the underbelly/ On the Orange Blossom Trail...\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cLiving on the shady side, there\u2019s a comfort level I have in that kind of environment,\u201d Cook offers. \u201cThat\u2019s where the reckless or the brave both say, \u2018Yeah, why not?\u2019 I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m supposed to do \u2013 (for me, writing these songs) is a necessity. It\u2019s the only power, the only tool, the only weapon I have.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cListen! We\u2019re going from Little Feat to REM, then put Appalachian harmonies on it. It\u2019s all funky grooves with dark guitars, burning guitars. People were tweeting me, \u2018Are you keeping it country?\u2019 And the truth is: No, I\u2019m keeping it real. Not to a \\r\\n\\r\\ngenre, but to what these songs are.\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s an imperfect balancing act: a lesson in compassion and grace and tolerance. You know, all these songs are either requiring it or exhibiting it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nCook laughs as she says this, knowing full well it\u2019s in banging into the furniture and stumbling down the halls that one learns to walk through the dark. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cGet out there and make mistakes \u2013 and don\u2019t apologize! I\u2019m not ashamed. This happened \u2013 and I\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/42/41-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.elizabeth-cook.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/elizabethcook\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/ElizabethCookMusic?v=app_373181362111\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/elizabeth_cook\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"elizabeth_cook\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1387091?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
