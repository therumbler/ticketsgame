Crisp, measured acoustic guitars cushion the Austin-based singer-songwriter\u2019s equally precise, conspiratorial vocals, while keening pedal steel, droning electric guitars, and the occasional askew keyboard add color. The results fall somewhere in the cracks between Neil Young and Crazy Horse noise hurricanes, road-worn folk songs, and low-key alt-country barnstorming.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore tellingly, Swan City Vampires begins with a bracing, two-minute instrumental track, \u201cParadise, Basically.\u201d Jagged electric guitar chords ripped apart by distortion and static dominate the song, aggression that\u2019s tempered by an unsettled, minor-key piano melody hovering just underneath the surface. It\u2019s not necessarily the easiest entry into an album, but make no mistake: This tone and sound\u2014which Johnson describes as \u201cpretty ugly\u201d\u2014is entirely deliberate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe album is a little reckless out of the gate, with the first song, and I wanted that to be the case,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted there to be some discomfort, some uncertainty and some oddity.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one sense, this approach is the result of Johnson\u2019s diverse musical collaborations\u2014including Monsters Of Folk with My Morning Jacket\u2019s Jim James and Bright Eyes\u2019 Conor Oberst; Overseas with David Bazan and Matt and Bubba Kadane; and a duo project with the late Jason Molina. However, Swan City Vampires\u2019 tension and doubt more obviously reflect the changes Johnson himself went through, both personally and professionally, as the album took shape. In early 2014, his mother passed away, while later that year, his band of nearly 20 years, Centro-matic, called it a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these events are referenced directly on Swan City Vampires. The melancholic, piano-curled \u201c(Made Us Feel Like) Kings\u201d is an elegy for his group\u2019s musical achievements, while \u201cThe Watchman\u201d is a tribute to his late mother. The latter song is particularly poignant: It blooms from slightly frayed acoustic guitar and lilting sonic whirrs into a barrage of electric guitar pelted with distraught keyboard zaps\u2014conveying the messiness of emotional catharsis, where grief and relief combine in imperfect ways.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhen the record was coming together, I was dealing with loss and a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cIt was a strange time, emotionally. I didn\u2019t necessarily know what I wanted the album to transmit. There was a lot of raw emotion flying around. For the first time, I didn\u2019t have some sort of grand picture or plan for the whole record. I wanted to get as much down as I could and figure it out later.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps as a result, Swan City Vampire\u2019s recording sessions were brisk and economical. The album was recorded and mixed in two separate three-day sessions with different engineers\u2014John Congleton (The Paper Chase, St. Vincent, Modest Mouse) and Britton Beisenherz (Monahans)\u2014with additional contributions from Phosphorescent\u2019s Ricky Ray Jackson and Johnson\u2019s long-time creative foil, drummer Matt Pence. It marked the first time Johnson had ever done a record in this split-session fashion. \u201cI was a little self-aware that it might have a patchwork quilt kind of feel to it,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut it wound up still feeling cohesive to me once I put all the songs together and sequenced them.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes this cohesion even more remarkable is that Swan City Vampire\u2019s songs were written during different points in Johnson\u2019s life. Several date from as far back as six years ago, when he was living in a little frame house in Bastrop, Texas, before he was married and became a father; others emerged more in the present-day, \u201cright near the finish line\u201d of the album. \u201cThere are some different perspectives, I suppose, in the writing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe writing itself came from different viewpoints\u2014or different vistas.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Swan City Vampires does have some common thematic threads, including working through restlessness and major life changes, and trying to figure out what\u2019s next after the familiar\u2019s been displaced. Yet more than ever, Johnson is comfortable embracing the unfamiliar\u2014as he does on the forthright \u201cYou vs. Off The Cuff,\u201d when he sings the lyric, \u201cHow perfect it is to see you again.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve never sung a line like that,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cIt made me uncomfortable demoing it for the first time, but in a good way\u2014in a way that I was finally unafraid to sing a line like that. There have been a lot of phases of my songwriting life where I probably would\u2019ve rolled my eyes and turned away from that. But for whatever reason, with all that was going on in my personal life, at the time it felt exactly right to sing a line like that.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.will-johnson.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/willjohnsonmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/willjohnsontx\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"willjohnsontx\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.dadadallas.com/event/1387410?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
