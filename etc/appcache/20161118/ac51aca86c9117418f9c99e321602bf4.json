Empire\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Crown The Empire BIO Since bursting onto the scene in 2011 with their debut EP, \u201cLimitless\u201d, Crown The Empire have shown no signs of slowing down. 2012 brought the band to the forefront with their debut full-length, \u201cThe Fallout\u201d, and a cocktail of world tours, magazine covers, and die hard fan dedication ensued, pushing \u2018 The Fallout\u2019  to sell over 85,000 copies to date. Their sophomore follow up \u2018 The Resistance: Rise of the Runaways\u2019  further explored the conceptual world within their previous release, and was greeted with even more enthusiasm, reflected in the 75,000copies sold in half the time of their previous effort. In 2016, Crown The Empire released their new album \u2018 Retrograde\u2019 . This record sees a departure from the conceptual world that defined their past efforts, and instead the band takes you on a voyage into the reality of their lives as a band of twenty-something\u2019 s growing up under a spotlight, and the way they see the world around them. Bathed in cinematic production reminiscent of the space epics \u2018 Interstellar\u2019  or \u2018 2001: A Space Odyssey\u2019 , combined with blistering guitar riffs comparable to the likes of \u2018 Incubus\u2019  or other alt-rockers of a time gone by, Crown The Empire have made their identity known with Retrograde, proving they have the song-writing prowess backed by an understanding and aptitude for cultural identity that has them ready to stand amongst the giants.  There is nothing fake about Retrograde. The 13 song LP blends seamlessly from track to track, allowing fans to truly embrace Crown The Empire as a soundtrack to their lives in an unparalleled way. Nothing is holding Crown back from being one of the biggest bands in rock, and \u2018 Retrograde\u2019  marks only the beginning of what will be a cultural impact the world over.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/24/61-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"4-U5JoHuw_A\",\"title\":\"Crown The Empire - Hologram (Official Music Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-U5JoHuw_A\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-U5JoHuw_A\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://facebook.com/riserecords\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Crowntheempire\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":850261,\"name\":\"blessthefall\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"In the two-year span since blessthefall's album His Last Walk was released, the band has undergone some internal repairs that could have sunk any other band on the rise. Not so for the Phoenix five-piece, who've learned that a kink in the gears isn't enough to stop a band this strong for good. Formed in 2004 by a group of higher-thinking high-schoolers who wanted their peers to find meaning and camaraderie in their music, blessthefall was intent on making their post-hardcore/screamo blend a different breed that people would remember. After several gigs in the area, more than just the locals began to notice. Later, after a 3-song EP made the rounds at shows and landed in label hands, this buzzy and burgeoning band were signed to Warner subsidiary Science Records and making their first full-length.\\n\\n\\\"Everyone has their first shows that consist of just the bands, and your parents, if you're lucky,\\\" reflects guitarist Eric Lambert. \\\"Things picked up rather quickly, though. We started selling out hometown shows, then started touring, and, oddly enough, we had fans outside of Arizona. It was small shows, but the fans we met are still coming to every show and are the best people ever.\\\"\\n\\nArmed with a defiant upcoming record and a new frontman, blessthefall have returned to the scene a stronger entity than ever before. Witness, the band's sophomore album and first with singer Beau Bokan, formerly of Take the Crown, will be released from new label Fearless Records, who signed the band in May. Bokan says this album reflects the positive energy that now enfolds the band. \\\"We wrote this album to show people we aren't the kind of band to lay down and give up,\\\" notes Bokan. \\\"We're here and won't be going anywhere for a long, long time.\\\" \\n\\nThose fans will undoubtedly be out in droves to obtain Witness, a forward-thinking record that boasts bigger choruses, heavier guitars and, essentially, Bokan adds, \\\"His Last Walk on steroids. It has all the same elements that got us where we are today.\\\" Recorded earlier this summer with Elvis Baskette (Incubus, Escape The Fate, Story Of The Year) in Virginia, blessthefall took their collective struggles to the forefront to produce a highly personal and evolved album - and bombastic live show - that shows the band back is with vengeance. \\n\\n\\\"With all the bands in the scene it's hard to stand out,\\\" says Bokan. \\\"Anyone can go into a studio and make an over produced album that sounds amazing, but if they can't pull it off live it means nothing. We pride ourselves on our live show, and we want people to walk away from our live show and be blown away. We leave our hearts on the stage every night. The greatest compliment to ever get is when someone says we sound better live than on CD.\\\"\\n\\nFor these Taste of Chaos veterans and current road warriors, they're anxious to take their performance chops to the road for Witness. While trying to win over new fans while appeasing the old may be a difficult task for some bands, blessthefall accept it eagerly as a challenge that they'll work toward with this record and its following tours. \\\"There is a lot more drive now that Beau is in the band,\\\" Lambert said. \\\"We know we have a lot to prove and we are all hungry for it.\\\"\\n\\nWitness is released by Fearless Records on October 6th, 2009.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":400},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":400},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-og.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":400},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":400},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":400},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/11/26/45-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":400}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://blessthefallmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/blessthefall\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/blessthefall\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/blessthefall\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"blessthefall\"},{\"id\":1257949,\"name\":\"New Years Day\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"New Years Day formed in 2005 after bassist Adam Lohrbach left the band Home Grown. Home Grown's final EP, 2004's When it All Comes Down, had diverged from the band's previous style of humorous pop punk and incorporated many emotional elements that Lohrbach carried over into New Years Day. Meeting with vocalist Ashley Costello and guitarist/keyboardist Keith Drover, the three began rehearsing songs that Costello and Lorhbach had written. These songs were heavily influenced by the members' shared emotional experiences, as Lohrbach and Costello had both recently been through difficult relationship break-ups.\\n\\nThe group soon added guitarist Mike Schoolden (formerly of Wakefield) and drummer Russell Dixon and took the name New Years Day.\\nThe band began building a reputation through promotion and posting songs on the MySpace social networking website, and were featured on the MySpace Records Volume 1 compilation CD and in the soundtrack of the video game Saints Row. After considering an offer from the Pete Wentz-run Decaydance Records label, the band signed to TVT Records and released a debut self-titled EP in 2006. Originally referred to as the Razor EP, it was primarily a digital release made available through download services such as iTunes, though CD copies were also available at the band's performances. They also performed at the South by Southwest music festival that same year.\\n\\nFrom 2006\u20132007 New Years Day self-financed and self-produced their debut album My Dear, recorded over an eight-month period at the home of producer Eugene Perreras.[3] The album was released on May 8, 2007 and includes collaborations with members of Reel Big Fish and Motion City Soundtrack. The band's debut music video for the lead single \\\"I Was Right\\\" won an MTVU \\\"Freshman Face\\\" poll and was added to the channel's playlist.\\n\\nThe band started writing new material in early 2009. Around September 2009, NYD posted two new songs on their MySpace page.[8] When asked about a new EP, vocalist Ashley Costello said, \\\"The EP is in its demo phase right now and we are still writing for it and recording it at the same time. The EP should be out in the spring of 2010.\\\"\\n\\nOn March 12, 2010, Alternative Press announced that New Year's Day have been added on the Warped Tour's summer dates. New Year's Day released their Japanese debut album called \\\"Headlines & Headstones\\\" on July 2nd, 2010 under Spinning Inc. The album contains music from their first EP, their first LP \\\"My Dear\\\", a Lady Gaga cover and new songs from their upcoming 2nd full-length US album.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":600},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-og.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":600},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":600},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":600},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/67/72/07-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.purevolume.com/newyearsday\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/newyearsday\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/nydrock?sk=app_108468622525037\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/NYDrock\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"NYDrock\"},{\"id\":1145567,\"name\":\"Too Close to Touch\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Too Close To Touch are still in their infancy as a band, but the Lexington, Kentucky, quintet already have a clear understanding of the music they want to make and the message they hope to convey. Although their sound flows easily from alternative to theatrical rock to post-hardcore, one thing remains consistent from song to song: Each one leaves an impact. \\\"We want it to hit hard, and not just in a music aspect, but meaning wise too. Every transition of song, every word, every note that's played, we want people to feel something from it,\\\" says vocalist Keaton Pierce. \\\"There are no gaps in songs where we just throw something there because we need something to go there. Everything's carefully placed and planned to keep the listener entranced. We want it to be a different experience than just somebody listening to a record. It's a story that you tell. You have four minutes of someone's undivided attention to get a meaning and a message across however you choose to do that. We view music more as an opportunity.\\\"\\n\\nToo Close To Touch, which also includes guitarists Mason Marble and Thomas Kidd, bassist Travis Moore and drummer Kenneth Downey, officially came together in late 2013, but its members have been playing together since 2012. In the past two years, they've focused on refining their songwriting and growing at their own pace, decisions that have no doubt paid off for them. \\\"We take our songs really seriously,\\\" says Mason. \\\"If we're not happy with something, it goes in the trash, and we start again. We just started keeping songs that we liked and writing more and more, and the more that we did it the more confident we became in the songs.\\\" Just as important to the band is their aesthetic. Taking cues from the 1975, Walk The Moon and the Neighbourhood, they've refined it to a look that's mixes indie and classic cool, all while remaining 100-percent them. Too Close To Touch began to grow in popularity thanks to their DIY work ethic, buzz on social media and impressive demos, which caught the eyes (and ears) of Epitaph founder Brett Gurewitz.\\n\\nThe band, who already have tours with Emarosa and A Lot Like Birds under their collective belt, will release their full-length debut in early 2015. However, longtime fans and first-time listeners will be able to get a taste of their new material when their self-titled EP is released digitally Oct. 21. From the fast-paced rock opener \\\"The Deep End\\\" which showcases Keaton's varied vocal range to \\\"Perfect World\\\" with its biting verses and sing-along ready chorus to the powerful, emotionally raw closer \\\"You Won't Listen,\\\" it's clear Too Close To Touch have found the one thing many bands spend years searching for: balance. Dark and light. Soaring vocals and guttural screams, dark lyrical content and pop-ready melodies. All combine to create a sound that is unique and exciting yet relatable. \\\"Every song has its own personality and its own emotions to it,\\\" Mason says. \\\"If you're looking at a picture or watching a movie, you feel a certain way.

After spending time in various local bands from around the area and abroad, this young five piece found their footing with the release of their first single \\\"Bring It On\\\" in July of 2013. Combining classically influenced guitar riffs, modern rock melodies and metal core breakdowns, LUTS has turned more than a few heads, bringing something unique to a genre that is plagued with copy cat bands. They spare no expense bringing the same energy found in their recordings to the stage, and with their recent addition to The Agency Group roster, the band is geared up to bring their show across the US and beyond. The future is bright for this young group, and with even greater goals on the horizon, LUTS shows no sign of slowing down.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/LUTSband/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/LUTSBand\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"LUTSBand\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.thirdstringproductions.com/event/1279061?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
