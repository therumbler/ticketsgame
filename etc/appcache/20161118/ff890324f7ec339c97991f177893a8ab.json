allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhy are you ok\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nThe question was asked by one of Ben Bridwell\u2019s daughters, on a machine that was not hers, using four-year-old fingers to reply to an alert in a language she couldn\u2019t read, much less write. In fact, the message could have very well been a declaration, not a query. Either way, it was definitely a cliffhanger. The daughter mashing random keys on her mother\u2019s phone, was and is Bridwell\u2019s second child of four, bringing the grand total of females in his house to five (six if you count the nanny). Six women. In your damn house. It\u2019s enough to turn a child\u2019s nonsense words into an existential probe\u2026 or to make you move into your garage and carve out a nice, warm place to write a record.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhy are you OK? Why, are you OK? Why are you, OK? Why are you. OK?\\r\\n \\r\\nLeader of Band of Horses since 2004, Bridwell recently learned that the path to creative epiphany can start with staying home, looking inside, and letting childlike wonder flourish. After years of searching for inspiration outside\u2014rocky shores, dense woods, desert plains\u2014he has uncovered a new conduit by growing roots: being a husband and a father, and channeling the resulting sense of exploration, uncertainty, fear, love, and courage into his music. In the process, he has brought his true inner self to the outside, and found additional guidance from a new producer, an old mentor, and his beloved bandmates, resulting in the fifth full-length Band of Horses album, Why Are You OK.\\r\\n \\r\\nAfter Band of Horses\u2019 2006 debut Everything All the Time, Bridwell would escape to various isolated retreats to write the subsequent three albums\u2014most often alone. Having indulged his transient tendencies since his teens, Band of Horses also recorded in numerous studios across the country, taking themselves in and out of comfort zones while working with producers from Phil Ek to the legendary Glyn Johns. Bridwell would thrive on change: welcoming now permanent band members in the process (Creighton Barrett on drums, Bill Reynolds on bass, Tyler Ramsey on guitar, and Ryan Monroe on keyboards). Why Are You OK marks the third album with the current Band of Horses lineup (including 2010\u2019s Infinite Arms and 2012\u2019s Mirage Rock), and was recorded and funded by the band before signing to Interscope Records\u2014their third label home. But this time, Bridwell did not travel to a remote location to write the bulk of the songs and instead holed up in his Charleston, South Carolina-area home to work in his converted garage-studio, writing in the odd, quiet hours when his children were at school or asleep.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cIn the past I would always run away from life to go and train my mind on creativity, but I didn\u2019t find that was actually working anymore,\u201d Bridwell says. \u201cI felt like I was more paranoid, kinda stuck in a rut being alone too much. There was a balance that being around a million females at home brought to it. That was a cool thing\u2014to realize I don\u2019t have to run away from writing.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nWriting Why Are You OK was Bridwell\u2019s chance to cleanse himself of doubts, balancing this new confidence in his work with an ever-present humility. \u201cI\u2019m always writing, and for people like me it\u2019s hard,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to work three times as long and more embarrassingly. I work every second I can; I don\u2019t stop. For the first time I just stayed home and did it. I had to work within a certain time frame. Once all the girls are asleep I can finally go for it, and then I\u2019m the morning guy, up by 6:30 to get them to school, so sometimes I would not sleep at all before taking them.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nPost-writing, Bridwell and the band rented an old house in the tiny North Carolina town of Bat Cave (really), played all kinds of songs together, old and (gradually) new. At the height of these relaxed good vibes, they realized it was time to start tracking a new album. Free of demands and deadlines of a record deal, they worked at their own pace and for no one but themselves. Seeking a producer who shared their sense of vibe, humor, and joy, Bridwell reached out to Jason Lytle of Grandaddy, indie stalwart and longtime BoH champion.\\r\\n \\r\\nDespite Lytle's meager experience producing music other than his own, Bridwell knew it was the move they needed. A huge Grandaddy fan who forms intense bonds with producers, Bridwell recalls, \u201cWe were taking a risk on indie rock in a way, and just having fun, making songs the way I make them\u2014which is amateurism at its worst, but fun as fuck\u2026 We didn\u2019t have anybody bearing down on us like an established taskmaster might. We really got to go slow and get deliberate and take it back to something more \u2018us.\u2019\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nBridwell and Lytle  clicked immediately on one early 2014 studio scouting trip to Stinson Beach in Northern California, forming a strong bond based as much on mutual admiration as shared tastes in others\u2019 music, humor, and work ethic. They brought the entire band back to Stinson later in the year to work as a unit on recording an album. In the interim, Bridwell and Lytle\u2019s creative rapport bloomed via email, Bridwell's ideas and demo sketches met with replies featuring Lytle\u2019s fleshed out ideas (including instrument parts and stand-in vocal melodies). Bridwell looks back on the pair\u2019s shared wavelength as rare and exciting. \u201cWe can smell our own for sure: we\u2019re both a bit grumpy, enjoy a cold beer or twelve, and like to laugh at funny shit. There\u2019s a brotherly connection. We share the same ears.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cIt was fascinating to be put into this position,\u201d Lytle says. \u201cAs any music fan can attest, it was like that feeling when you see one of your favorite bands and you kind of see the path that they\u2019re on and you can almost think, \u201cGod, this is the record I want them to make.\u201d I got to have some sort of hand in helping direct the direction the record is gonna go.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nBand of Horses worked with Lytle in Stinson for most of October 2014, continually inspired by their progress as well as by the incredible weather, surf, and picturesque surroundings. The residential situation provided a habitat for the band, allowing big-picture motifs and album-related philosophical discussions to take shape outside of the actual studio. Like politicians getting the real work done at the bar after Congress lets out for the day, the band was able to achieve an important focus in their off hours and in a more friendly, familial environment.\\r\\n \\r\\nThat sense of relaxed discovery and progress was reestablished at Applehead Recording in Woodstock, New York, in February 2015. \u201cWe were nearing the end, and we\u2019d been in Stinson, this amazing church of weather and stars and peace and quiet, and it was like we needed another side of the coin,\u201d Bridwell says. \u201cWe thought, \u2018Let\u2019s go to Upstate New York, another residential studio, and maybe we\u2019ll get some snow and a shut-in vibe, more of a hunker-down thing.\u2019 The beauty of it was inspiring as hell, especially when you\u2019re from the South; snow is magical.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nIntroducing the band to cross-country skiing, Lytle  would rise early  each morning to \u201clay the track\u201d for the day\u2019s course outside in the fresh snow. The  \u201ctracking\u201d irony was not lost on the band and became a symbol of their bond with their producer. \\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a big proponent of balance, and I think there\u2019s definitely a black art to the producer and the things they\u2019re doing that are going to somehow affect the morale,\u201d Lytle says. \u201cI would rather have it be as enjoyable, lighthearted, exciting, and creative as possible. It definitely did get to a point where it was up to me to have the overall focus on the song and attempt to relay that back to Ben, and then we would start honing in on the shapes of the songs. There was a big emphasis on taking it back to the \u2018kid in the bedroom\u2019 thing and lots of laughter and lightheartedness and everyone being available to chime in.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nOr, as Bridwell says, \u201cThe fact that he was actually laying down tracks on the snow for us to ski in and then going back in the studio and producing our album was not lost on us. It\u2019s fucking hilarious. It\u2019s a very stupid irony that we could not get enough of.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nLytle gained impressive insight into the way the band works, and was well suited to capture them at their best selves, learning to understand what makes them tick. \u201cEveryone in the band will look to Ben and defer to him, but I think he has done a pretty amazing job of surrounding himself with people he\u2019s comfortable with,\u201d Lytle says. \u201cHe knows that he is a collaborator, that he is reliant on people with awesome skills and talents. He\u2019s opened himself up. He has a big responsibility, too, of looking after these guys. He would always have to remind me that it\u2019s just as important to make sure that everyone feels involved and that everyone has a say. That was always a good lesson to relearn in the face of my impatience.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nAnother mentor who helped guide Bridwell through the creation of Why Are You OK was Rick Rubin\u2014marking the second time Rubin has played a role in shaping a Band of Horses album (he also helped to bring the band to Columbia Records for 2010\u2019s Infinite Arms).\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cRick came along at the perfect time,\u201d Bridwell says. \u201cWe\u2019d amassed a group of songs but were still a bit listless, swinging all over the damn place. Rick took a liking to it, and really helped steer a lot of tepid, mixed emotions on a lot of things. That really reined it in for me, even a couple of songs I wasn\u2019t sure about; he\u2019d say, \u2018That\u2019s good, keep going that way\u2019\u2014that helped a lot. It was nice to have somebody pat you on the back and tell you you\u2019re on the right track. He\u2019s saved us twice now.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nFor Bridwell, a self-described amateur songwriter and musician, that vote of confidence can be all that is needed to carry a song into the world. Throughout the journey of Why Are You OK, Bridwell learned to trust his process and to extend and share the comfort and joy he finds at home in his little garage. Soul-baring is difficult for many artists, but after a decade fronting one of America\u2019s best-loved rock bands, it might just be getting easier for Bridwell.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cMost times I forget all about clich\u00e9s when telling a story,\u201d he says. \u201cIt rarely crosses my mind. But as a song progresses and I\u2019m reminded that others will hear it, I tend to get cold feet. I definitely wanted to be more alert for those clich\u00e9s after the last two records were chock full of them. I wanted the album to sound like my junk-ass room at home, where there\u2019s shit everywhere and I can be as weird as I want and paint with my brushes at the pace I require. Because I\u2019m not coming from a place of knowing what chords should go on what, incorporating that into this record was definitely part of the whole thing of wanting to go more inward and inside myself. Because I didn\u2019t go away, physically, I got to use all my gear for once instead of an isolated location where you\u2019re limited by what you can bring with you. I got these demos of textures that I thought we could all apply together as a band, and having Jason there, and the Horses members being great as hell, was a cool and interesting collaboration in itself.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nAs a result, Why Are You OK is the sound of a band evolved, of trust and guidance and the inner self realized, and shared. Perhaps the lesson of the album, and of Band of Horses itself, is a story of trust: When you surround yourself with the people you love most, everything will be OK.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about this record and us taking more control of how we went about it,\u201d Bridwell says. \u201cI really wanted to know the stories a bit better, I wasn\u2019t under pressure to hurry up. I didn\u2019t want to start getting too clever for fear of exposing myself. I expose myself all over this album. Sometimes you can try to get too clever or write a whole song about absolute drivel because you were afraid to make it into a more real thing. I guess I made an effort to be less of a coward.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cJason Lytle helped me every step of the way. The band supported me in my quest for different sounding feelings even when it didn\u2019t include them. I\u2019m still so childlike with it, without any real experience to go behind any instruments besides some guitar, so it\u2019s always a real childlike experience. I can\u2019t get too methodical with any of it. I\u2019m so fucking proud and pleased that I\u2019ve been able to have a life in music at all, I don\u2019t discredit any of it.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nLooking after his family, looking after his band, and laying tracks for others to follow, Ben Bridwell has become a true leader and collaborator, carving out a nice, warm place from which to make his mark on all of us.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"http://www.amazon.com/Band-of-Horses/e/B0017P6WMW/?tag=930clu-20\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bandofhorses.com/us/home\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/bandofhorses\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/bandofhorses\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bandofhorses\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bandofhorses\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1327963?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
