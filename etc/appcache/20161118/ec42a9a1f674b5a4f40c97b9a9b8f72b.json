His father a city manager, and his mother an artist, John's family moved every few years, and he grew up in several mid-western towns. Omaha, Nebraska; Cincinnati, Ohio; and then, in Davenport, Iowa at the age of nine, John began to study classical violin. Moving to Palatine, Illinois in the Chicago suburbs at the beginning of his high school years, John caught the rock-n-roll bug, and, on a quest to understand improvisation, began teaching himself guitar and mandolin. While still in high school, John played guitar in several bands, covering a broad spectrum of American and British \\\"guitar rock\\\" as well as writing songs and learning the rudiments of multi-track recording.\\r\\nJohn flirted briefly with college life, going to William Rainey Harper College as a classical guitar music major. But, he began living on his own, and found work, school, and his own local bands to be too much on his plate. It was during this time that a friend turned John onto the Grateful Dead. He fell in love instantly, and, shortly thereafter, dropped out of college. By this time, however, John was already playing out a few times a year, anywhere an underage musician could find a gig, and Chicago would be where he called home for the next fifteen years of his life.\\r\\nOnce he turned twenty-one, John began playing regularly with several local and regional groups, most notably Hairball Willie and Uncle John's Band. While most of the bands he played with wrote their own music, in 1997 John co-founded the group, Dark Star Orchestra, a band exclusively devoted to playing the well-documented actual setlists of the Grateful Dead. Originally started as a side-project house band for some of the best local deadhead musicians, \\\"DSO\\\" rapidly became a nationally touring band, attracting many guests to join them onstage, including John Fishman, Mike Gordon, Sam Bush, Jorma Kaukonen John Popper, Sanjay Mishra, Tom Constanten, Vince Welnick, Donna Jean Godchaux-Mackay, Bill Kreutzmann, and Bob Weir to name a few.\\r\\nWhile spending the better part of twelve years of his life touring with DSO, John also found time for other musical projects, both live and studio. A bluegrass band, numerous short-lived original groups, and then in 2003 John began playing sporadically with Melvin Seals. Out of those shows came a group with Melvin called The Mix, also featuring Greg Anton, Jeff Pevar, and Kevin Rosen. The Mix toured nationally and went on to sign a recording contract, releasing a full length CD in 2004 titled, American Spring, but eventually disbanded for lack time in everyone's schedule to tour. And then, of course, in 2009 John departed from Dark Star Orchestra to join Furthur.\\r\\nJohn now lives near Washington, DC with his wife, Katy Gaughan, and, when not on the road with Furthur, performs in the DC area with the newly formed and simply named John K Band, as well as solo acoustic and special guest appearances.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":240,\"height\":266},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":240,\"height\":266},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":240,\"height\":266},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":222},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-og.jpg\",\"width\":240,\"height\":266},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":111},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":240,\"height\":266},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":240,\"height\":266},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":240,\"height\":266},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/24/17-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":240,\"height\":266}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"IKxfymmh7-k\",\"title\":\"John Kadlecik & the DC Mystery Cats - GypsySally's - Washington, DC\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKxfymmh7-k\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKxfymmh7-k\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.johnkmusic.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/DCMysteryCats/timeline\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":958647,\"name\":\"A benefit for DC Central Kitchen.

That\u2019s a lot of meals \u2013 but don\u2019t mistake us for a soup kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nDC Central Kitchen was founded by young nightclub manager named Robert Egger. Frustrated by his experience volunteering with a well-intentioned, but inefficient and ineffective program that fed homeless DC residents, Robert saw a way to rearrange DC\u2019s existing resources in ways that would ultimately liberate hungry and homeless individuals from poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began operations in January 1989 by picking up the leftover food from George H.W. Bush\u2019s inauguration with a refrigerated van and delivering it to area shelters. A few months later, DCCK secured its own kitchen space and launched a Culinary Job Training program for residents of those shelters. DCCK has always focused on hand-ups, not hand-outs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organization continued to grow, breaking new ground in the realm of social enterprise and helping to start more than 60 like-minded community kitchens across the country through the 1990s. In 2001, Robert launched The Campus Kitchens Project, a highly efficient means of replicating DCCK\u2019s core activities at college and high schools throughout the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, Michael F. Curtin, Jr. joined DCCK as its Chief Operating Officer. Curtin focused on enhancing the day-to-day programmatic work of DC Central Kitchen while Robert led national conversations about rethinking the fight against hunger and the role of nonprofits in the US economy. In 2007, Michael became CEO and in 2008, he led the organization\u2019s move into the healthy school food space, a step that allowed DCCK to double in size and impact. In 2012, Robert moved to Los Angeles to start another innovative, but unaffiliated, nonprofit and social enterprise called LA Kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo books about DC Central Kitchen are in print and available through online booksellers:\\r\\n\\r\\nBegging for Change: The Dollars and Sense of Making Nonprofits Responsive, Efficient, and Rewarding for All, by Robert Egger (2004). \u201cIn Begging for Change, Robert Egger looks back on his experience and exposes the startling lack of logic, waste, and ineffectiveness he has encountered during his years in the nonprofit sector, and calls for reform of this $800 billion industry from the inside out.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Food Fighters: DC Central Kitchen\u2019s First Twenty-Five Years on the Front Lines of Hunger and Poverty, by Alexander Justice Moore (2014). \u201cThe Food Fighters shows how Robert Egger\u2019s innovative approach to combating hunger and creating opportunity has changed lives and why the organization is more relevant today than ever before. It captures the personal and organizational struggles of DC Central Kitchen, offering new insights about what doing good really means and what we expect of those who do it.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":175,\"height\":175},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":175,\"height\":175},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atlg.png\",\"width\":175,\"height\":175},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atlg1.png\",\"width\":175,\"height\":175},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atmd.png\",\"width\":175,\"height\":175},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-og.png\",\"width\":175,\"height\":175},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atxl.png\",\"width\":175,\"height\":175},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atxl1.png\",\"width\":175,\"height\":175},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atxxl.png\",\"width\":175,\"height\":175},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/32/09-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":175,\"height\":175}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.dccentralkitchen.org/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1284203?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
