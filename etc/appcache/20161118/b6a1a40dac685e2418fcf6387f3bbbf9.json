Sounds\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Like its namesake, it\u2019s easy to look forward to WEEKEND, the new album by Swedish indie rockers THE SOUNDS (Label:Arnioki Records/INgrooves; Release date: October 29, 2013). Sporting an urgency like that of a band fresh out of the womb, Weekend is the sound of a band rejuvenated and reborn. For The Sounds, they have been reborn in a sense\u2026 back to when they first started. \u201cWeekend is more of a back to basics album,\u201d says Jesper Anderberg (keyboards/guitar). \u201cI was primarily looking for a groove when I started writing this album \u2013 a groove based on five members who have been playing music together for a long time. We weren\u2019t looking to overthink the song writing, and especially wanted to make it sound like we just hit the switch on the amps and just started playing the songs.\u201d To celebrate the release of Weekend, the band will be playing a handful of North American dates including stops in Brooklyn, Canada, Chicago and the West Coast, followed by a full European headline tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the punky dance rock signature sound of the opening tracks \u201cShake Shake Shake\u201d and \u201cTake It The Wrong Way\u201d that recalls the shuffling exuberance of their groundbreaking debut to the winsome and shimmery \u201cHurt the Ones I Love\u201d to the 60s style rock of \u201cEmperor\u201d, Weekend takes their trademark danceable indie rock \u201csound\u201d and expands in different directions. This musical journey is most noticeable in the chill-down title track \u201cWeekend\u201d and the cleverly disguised dance infused \u201cGreat Day\u201d, which both start acoustically yet build and evolve to a frenzy of passion and instrumentation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sounds collected and leaned upon all of the lessons they\u2019ve learned from touring the world headlining clubs and festivals, owning a studio and self producing their last album Something To Die For when writing and recording this album. These experiences propel them forward on Weekend thanks in part to the production work of Alex Newport (Bloc Party, Death Cab for Cutie, City and Colour, Frank Turner, At The Drive-In, The Mars Volta) who moved with the band into the legendary Svenska Grammafon Studion far away from the bands hometown, and tied it all together capturing the magic in the studio that has delighted and captivated fans for a decade on the road. \u201cWhile recording, we all lived in the SGS studios together with Alex, and we were all using the same kitchen and bathroom and so on,\u201d says drummer Fredrik Blond. \u201cThat creates a certain vibe I think. And it forces you to deal with things, not just run away from them.\u201d Adds Jesper, \u201cIt\u2019s important to be able to try new approaches, and we\u2019ve never been afraid of trying new paths in our songwriting. I think it\u2019s important for bands to be able to change their sound and explore new ways. I believe we have great fans that understand the process of music making, that not every album will or can sound the same. Our fans are also the ones that give us exactly that privilege\u2026.to write and record the songs we want, the way we want them to sound\u2026and for that we are very grateful.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFormed in 1998 in Sweden, The Sounds exploded on the alt-rock scene with their wildly lauded 2002 debut Living in America and its breakthrough singles \u201cSeven Days a Week\u201d, \u201cRock\u2019n Roll\u201d, and the aptly named title track. Fronted by the striking Maja Ivarsson, The Sounds have continued to remain on the forefront of the music scene, releasing a handful of albums, each spawning single after single like \u201cTony the Beat\u201d, \u201cPainted By Numbers\u201d, \u201cSong With A Mission\u201d, \u201cNo One Sleeps When I\u2019m Awake\u201d, \u201cBeatbox\u201d, \u201cSomething to Die For\u201d and \u201cDance with the Devil\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s a mutual love to music and to our fans,\u201d explains Jesper about how they\u2019ve been able to remain for over a decade and a half and maintain the same line-up and uphold their creative spark. \u201cThe key is to respect each other. It\u2019s a weird thing to be together for that long. You might have disagreements but that\u2019s the way it is sometimes, but if you can\u2019t solve an argument, you shouldn\u2019t start a band. But for us, it has always been us and it will only be the five of us.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":672},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":210},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":140},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":672},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":70},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":350},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":455},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/92/14/13-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.the-sounds.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/thesounds\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/thesounds\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/thesounds\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"thesounds\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1738275,\"name\":\"Zipper Club\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Zipper Club is comprised of Mason James of Cerebral Ballzy and Lissy Trullie of Lissy Trullie. \u201cI was never pigeonholed into liking one specific genre,\u201d says Mason, the no-nonsense guitarist and founding member behind the addictive assault of a new-wave inspired band alongside multi-instrumentalist, co-writer, and vocalist Lissy Trullie. \u201cIf it sounds good I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s from the 1920s or the 2016s. As a musician, you take little tidbits of cool sounds you hear and combine them into something completely unique. it needs to reflect on itself.\u201d Such a lack of musical inhibition goes a long way in explaining how Mason, a raucous punk-rock kid whose life goals were once to \u201cthrash around onstage and get wildly drunk\u201d with his previous band, Cerebral Ballzy, and Trullie, a successful solo artist in her own right with her eponymous indie-rock band, threw caution to the wind and concocted pop music unlike any they\u2019ve made before. \u201cI really respect and love well-written hooks. That\u2019s always something that gets me excited,\u201d Trullie says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge change and not a logical one,\u201d Mason says with a laugh of Zipper Club\u2019s pop missiles, which he began penning two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a super 180 for me. But that\u2019s what I think is really cool about it. It made me realize that the music is the only thing that matters.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nZipper Club is at its core a union of like-minded musicians who share a musical story and, through their respective former bands, have each navigated the rocky waters of the music industry. The result is a blissful head rush of a band now coming to the fore, armed with buzzing guitars, spacey synths and magnetic melodies via its debut single, \u201cGoing The Distance.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s music that\u2019s not trying to be something it\u2019s not,\u201d Trullie says of the band\u2019s addictive, brain-lodging sound on its forthcoming debut album, produced by James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins, A Perfect Circle).

A few blocks away, in the Midwood area, sits the home in which his mother grew up. A prolonged illness had claimed her life a few years earlier.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cThat was me coming to terms with the whole situation,\u201d the My Jerusalem frontman explains of his attempt to embed himself within his family history after many years of being on the road, touring. \u201cI kept walking by this house my grandparents used to live in on Avenue H. I\u2019ve never been very connected to family. I\u2019ve romanticized the idea of family, but I think I was just trying to connect with something.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nKlein, who normally resides in Austin, felt an immediate inspiration there and was prolific during these winter weeks near his mother\u2019s childhood neighborhood, producing 14 songs, 12 of which would come to be the band\u2019s forthcoming album, A Little Death.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cThe little death,\u201d or \u201cla petite mort\u201d in French, refers to, well, an orgasm, and somewhere between the literal definition and the slang is where Klein situated the album. \u201cLike any kid, I was obsessed with death and obsessed with sex. Some people grow out of it and start families and become normal people and some of us just stay the same,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m still obsessing about the psychology behind death and sex.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nThis duality bleeds through on the album, which flexes a lurid sexual energy, reminiscent of something between Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Echo and the Bunnymen. Though My Jerusalem has been kicking around in some capacity since 2010, A Little Death is the first album with a solidified lineup. Previously, the band had been more of a collective, with contributions from Klein\u2019s revolving door of friends from previous projects, Gutter Twins and The Twilight Singers, and who had also played in bands like Cursive, Okkervil River, and the Polyphonic Spree. Now, with a full-time lineup of members including Grant Van Amburgh (drums), Kyle Robarge (bass), and Jon Merz (guitar, keys, horns), My Jerusalem is a true band, Klein says.\\r\\n \\r\\nAlongside standout tracks like the high-energy \u201cRabbit Rabbit\u201d and the slowed down banger \u201cNo One Gonna Give You Love,\u201d Klein also enlisted the help of another friend on A Little Death\u2019s opener, \u201cYoung Leather,\u201d singer Elle King, who contributes background vocals under the song\u2019s raging saxophone. The two have history back to when King was younger and used to work at the tattoo shop where Klein\u2019s friends would hang out. Her timeless voice is the perfect complement to the old-fashioned nature of A Little Death, an album which pays homage to a classic era of rock and roll, one that lacked pretension and focused on honesty in songwriting.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cThe album has a throwback vibe to it,\u201d says Klein, who spent many nights walking around the time capsule of an area around his rental home, among the Russian immigrants and foreign culture of the New York blocks. \u201cI feel like you can hear Brooklyn in the 50s and 60s in that record, or maybe it\u2019s my delusional mind.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, through A Little Death, Klein was finally able to reflect on the family and personal issues he\u2019d put on the backburner for years. \u201cThere\u2019s a recurring theme of fate, luck, desire, and consequence,\u201d he says of it, \u201cand also, how to be more accountable as a human.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":622},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":194},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":194},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":129},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":129},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-og.jpg\",\"width\":1407,\"height\":911},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":65},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":65},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":324},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":324},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":421},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/42/49-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":421}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://thisismyjerusalem.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/myjerusalem/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/myjerusalem\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"myjerusalem\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.utphilly.com/event/1342971?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
