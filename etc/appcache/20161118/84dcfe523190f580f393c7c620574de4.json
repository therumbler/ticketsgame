The man behind the moniker, George Evelyn, just keeps reinventing, not in a wilful Bowie way, but flowing along, going at whatever speed he fancies to wherever his ideas carry him. For the last seven years he\u2019s lived in an Ibizan farmhouse and, while he\u2019s Warp Records\u2019 longest serving artist \u2013 \u201cthe granddaddy,\u201d as he puts it \u2013 he overwhelmingly focuses on his current projects, letting them revitalize his music.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps best known in Europe for his ground-breaking \u201890s albums \u2018Smokers Delight\u2019 and \u2018Carboot Soul\u2019 \u2013 although in America the cinematic lo-funk of 2006\u2019s \u2018In A Space Outta Sound\u2019 is better known \u2013 Evelyn\u2019s pride and joy these days is his four year old underground party on the white island. Wax Da Jam at Las Dalias, Ibiza\u2019s oldest nightclub, 50 this summer, has become a go-to haunt for locals, for promoters and insiders, the place where George explains, \u201cEveryone turns up as individuals but everybody leaves as one.\u201d Here he soundtracks a night of groove, experimentation, percussion and improvisation, alongside guests such as DJ Shadow and Roots Manuva. It\u2019s all fun, though, all for kicks. It\u2019s all about \u2018Feelin\u2019 Good\u2019, hence the name of his new album.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf that sounds a bit hippy dippy, forget it, \u2018Feelin\u2019 Good\u2019 is zesty with funk, soul, even the throbbing low slung house tune \u2018Tapestry\u2019. Of the latter he says, \u201cHouse was always about fun to me. There was a period when it didn\u2019t sound like it was made by people who could dance but now it feels like the groove is back.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe should know, he was there at the start, delivering those seismic 1989/90 bleep classics \u2018Dextrous\u2019 and \u2018Aftermath\u2019, but it was his KLF-influenced, five-years-in-the-making dissection of hip hop to its stoned component parts, \u2018Smokers Delight\u2019, that proved he was about more than the dancefloor. He followed this with 1999\u2019s \u2018Carboot Soul\u2019, ten tracks that had a more organic funk feel.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth albums, in fact all George\u2019s recording career, alongside his contemporary Balearic vision, filter into the genial bounce and contagiousness of his seventh studio outing. \u2018Masterplan\u2019 is bracing trip hop soul featuring Californian folk singer Katy Gray, \u2018Now Is The Time\u2019 is a squidgy funk assault that George reckons is marinated in Wax Da Jam flavour, \u2018Give Thx\u2019 bleeds \u201870s Motown vibes, \u2018Eye (Can\u2019t See)\u2019is a gripping, glitched, Latin groove, the latter pair both featuring ex-Zero 7 singer Moses, while \u2018Om Sweet H(om)e\u2019 finds M People percussionist Shovel and George himself revving up to the sounds of chanting Tibetan monks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s an album that\u2019s sonically rich, with orchestration and strings created in Berlin by Jazzanova arranger Sebastian Studnitzky, keyboard by George\u2019s long-term collaborator Robin Taylor-Firth, drums by virtuoso German jazzer Wolfgang Haffner and bass by Paul Powell, who used to be at the heart of Mica Paris\u2019s rhythm section.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh yes, the bass, that\u2019s where it all started for George Evelyn. Raised in Leeds\u2019 inner-city (Hyde Park, Burley), the son of a bingo hall accountant mum and engineer dad, a childhood friend\u2019s older brother was don of the local Messiah sound system. George embraced dub and reggae from nine years old. The first artist he became a fan of was dub remixer Scientist \u2013 \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the music, it was the cartoon sleeves,\u201d he laughs, \u201cI was nine years old, after all!\u201d Picking up his father\u2019s appreciation of everything from Duke Ellington to Isaac Hayes to Shalamar, he also built his own home system from shoeboxes and discarded speaker units purloined from a nearby television factory, all attached to a Fidelity record player.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI come from the city but sunshine is in my music,\u201d he explains, \u201cIt was always a natural dream to make music in the sun like I do now. Not to take away from any of my previous music but \u2018Feelin\u2019 Good\u2019 is what I\u2019ve always been trying to do. For instance, on \u2018Give Thx\u2019 I wanted the message to be a universal thank you for everything. I wanted to get it across in a way that was happy but wasn\u2019t preachy, wasn\u2019t cheesy. I had to manifest it, to genuinely mean it with energy. That\u2019s how I went through the process of making the whole album, really feeling it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as working with Warp, George had his own label for five years, Wax On, but he ceased involvement in 2010 to concentrate on his increasingly popular Wax Da Jam nights, which grew out of his Wax Da Beach parties in San Antonio Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s been pivotal to my music making,\u201d he says, \u201cand also made me think about the new concept of my live show. I\u2019ve done the full band thing and the sound system thing and now I really want to marry the two and to do so with a real live percussive edge.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith tours coming this Autumn, Europe and the US will be able to see these ideas come to fruition. In the meantime, there are the ten tracks of \u2018Feelin\u2019 Good\u2019, the same number as \u2018Carboot Soul\u2019, a good omen according to George, a man positively overflowing with good omens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe album initially had many possible names,\u201d he ventures, \u201cBut I got on the mic at Wax Da Jam and talked about how music shifted the energy to make people feel good. It\u2019s everbody\u2019s sovereign right to feel good, so I want the album to remind people of that, a soundscape to feeling good, that\u2019s my aim.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting his sights high, as ever, with a cheery, unpretentious sincerity, George Evelyn continues to carry the original flame of acid house and late \u201880s Balearica, pushing it alive\u2019n\u2019kicking into 2013. His new album will surprise many, as bubbly, warm and lively a thing as will be heard all year. Nightmares on Wax are back. Then again, like the underground itself, they never really went away.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":237},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":237},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":237},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-og.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":237},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":237},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":237},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":237},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/75/44/71-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":237}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/180865010&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\\\"><\\/iframe>\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VA_WYKGrFg\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.nightmaresonwax.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/nightmaresonwaxofficial?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/nightmaresonwax\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"nightmaresonwax\"},{\"id\":1680413,\"name\":\"Romare\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The young electronic musician known as Romare wears his inspiration on his sleeve \u2013 in fact, he takes his very name from it. Having studied African American Visual Culture at University, he had his \u2018Sex Pistols moment\u2019 when he came across the work of Romare Bearden. The African American\u2019s collaged, cut\u2019n\u2019paste artworks inspired the young musician to apply a similar technique to music \u2013 an approach that was hugely fruitful, and remains central to his work today. After stints as a drummer and guitarist throughout school and university, he moved to Paris where he picked up the turntables and began mixing his own music with samples from second hand records. Romare the musician was born and the template for his debut record.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderground hothouse Black Acre signed him in 2012, adding him to a formidable roster that included Loops Haunt, Fantastic Mr Fox, Blue Daisy and Dark Sky. The imprint put out his first release \u2018Meditations on Afrocentrism\u2019 in March of that year. He began to play shows, making enough money to finance a move to London. Ensconced in the vast musical melting pot of the capital, he began work on his second EP \u2018Love Songs: Part One.\u2019 Romare\u2019s songs were included on compilations by heavyweights such as Bonobo and Tiga, as well as the Brownswood Recordings imprint.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis debut album, Projections, is named after a pivotal exhibition of his namesake and likewise explores various elements of American life. The album is in many ways a homage to the cycle of cultural appropriation in America. \u201cWork Song\u201d is a tribute to the classic American and namesake work song, whilst \u201cRainbow\u201d is a celebration of disco. Projections expertly catalogues the movements of influence within music. The album doesn\u2019t just sample music and vocal snatches, but also other sources such as documentaries and marries live instrumentation with the sampling palette.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith fierce support from by the likes of Benji B, Gilles Peterson and Huw Stephens, Romare\u2019s music has, rightfully, already caused a stir. The stage is now set for his stunning debut album, Projections.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":158},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":158},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":158},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":158},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-og.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":158},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":158},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":158},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":158},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/57/71-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":237,\"height\":158}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/258497746&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\\\"><\\/iframe>\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NekoiOaCV_M\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/romare\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/romaremusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.cervantesmasterpiece.com/event/1292187?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
