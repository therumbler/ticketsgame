very day Yelawolf was born, his teenage mother strapped him into a stroller and rolled him around the mall. The first week of his life, she took him to house parties, and by the time he left high school, the family had roamed to so many towns that Yelawolf had attended 15 different schools. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI really never ever stopped moving,\u201d he says while driving around Nashville, his home of the past three years. \u201cThat\u2019s my life story in a nutshell.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nWith his latest release, Love Story, perhaps he can finally downshift. Since 2010\u2019s Trunk Muzik, his career has been on the fast track. His appearance\u2014his tattoos include a catfish swimming down his forearm and \u201cHeart of Dixie\u201d stamped on his stomach\u2014and raps about Appalachian meth dealers might\u2019ve made him a novelty act. But his rapid-fire delivery and intense live show ensured no one considered him a joke. As Pitchfork marveled, \u201cYelawolf is a powerful new rap voice, one that draws from all over the map without sounding much like anyone else.\u201d Interscope Records agreed and within three months, he had a major label deal. Later that year, the tape was re-released as Trunk Muzik 0-60, and Rolling Stone praised him as \u201can MC whose liquid flow breathes life into genre clich\u00e9s.\u201d In January 2011, he signed to Eminem\u2019s Shady Records, and his fan base grew even more rabid. Yet Wolf wasn\u2019t satisfied. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe mullet and Three 6 Mafia. How do you make that work?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve always been trying to do is figure out how to make that into a good mixture of music.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nYelawolf was born Michael Wayne Atha in Gadsden, Alabama, where his two musical loves grew organically. His mom dated a sound engineer, and Wolf remembers being onstage at age six with Dwight Yoakam, and Run DMC coming by his house to party after their local show when he was seven. \u201cI woke up in this trailer park and figured out what was ironic about who I was and where I was from wasn\u2019t that what I was experiencing was new. It was just that I recognized the extreme of it,\u201d he says. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being homeless in Berkeley and working on a ship off the coast of Washington state, Yelawolf landed back in the South and started making mixtapes. He was purposefully rowdy, wearing head-to-toe deer hunting camouflage and gold teeth. In Atlanta, Wolf and his friend Malay (the producer who later won a Grammy for Frank Ocean\u2019s Channel Orange) started a \u201cfuturistic country hip-hop rock band\u201d that included both a DJ and a black fiddle player. Their self-described \u201carena rap\u201d became popular in Atlanta, pulling huge crowds as well as the attention of Lil Wayne and L.A. Reid. But their idea was ahead of its time and fizzled. \\r\\n\\r\\nWolf was poor, and his now ex-girlfriend and their child were still living in Gadsden. Running out of options, he returned to Alabama with producer WLPWR. \u201cWe got an 8-track recorder in the back of this shitty house in this factory neighborhood worthy of any Harmony Korine film, and we wrote Trunk Muzik front to back,\u201d he says. He hustled back to Atlanta to record it, and the tape that set his career ablaze and resulted in his working with legends like Bun B and Big Boi was completed in all of a week and a half. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI became that shit. I saw the power in it. [And] I felt fulfilled,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I always knew, \u2018Wait \u2018till they hear the shit I did with Malay.\u2019\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nAt long last, they\u2019re listening, and the response is as positive as he always believed it would be. Recorded entirely in Nashville\u2019s Blackbird Studios and executively produced by Eminem, his passion project\u2014fittingly titled Love Story\u2014is a rootsy, country-tinged rock album brimming with strong lyricism. Finally, he\u2019s struck the right balance. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m not reinventing the wheel. It\u2019s nothing Kid Rock hasn\u2019t done,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what is new is my deep appreciation for lyricism in hip hop, [my desire] to be a great lyricist. And a deep appreciation for outlaw country, for raw classic rock. I started to learn how to blend concepts together.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed he did. The album\u2019s first single, \u201cTill It\u2019s Gone,\u201d is a driving barn burner of a song elevated by Wolf\u2019s melodically sung hook. Radio friendly without sacrificing its soul, it\u2019s an undeniable smash that\u2019s in line with the country\u2019s recent obsession with the culture of rural American life. In fact, \u201cTill It\u2019s Gone\u201d premiered last September on the wildly popular FX drama Sons of Anarchy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt might be simple, but when I decided to put down sneakers and throw on some boots \u2026 it feels like I've come full circle ... riding Harleys with my Dad ... it all makes sense, \u201d he says. A smile enters his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest exhale.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nYelaWolf's new album Love Story is in stores NOW!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-og.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":853},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/07-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"np3pU-dLok4\",\"title\":\"Yelawolf - Pop The Trunk\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/np3pU-dLok4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"WjF4eOnjCLE\",\"title\":\"Yelawolf - Let's Roll ft.

With the recent success of Colt Ford and The Lacs along with current \u201crap style\u201d hits by country mega stars Jason Aldean (Dirt Road Anthem), Toby Keith (Red Solo Cup) and Tim McGraw (Truck Yeah), one would think that this is a new concept. But if you are a true hip-hop historian you would recall that this movement actual began in 2001 with the release of Bubba Sparxxx\u2019s debut album \u201cDark Days, Bright Nights\u201d. The video for the first single \u201cUgly\u201d featured Bubba and pals in the mud with pigs, on tractors and performing in front of a house covered with bug lights. If that\u2019s not the epitome of Country, then nothing is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe platinum certified \u201cDark Days, Bright Nights\u201d debuted on Interscope Records in October 2001 and was produced by Houchins and superstar producers Timbaland and Organized Noize. It was follow-up by the critically acclaimed 2003 release \u201cDeliverance\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI remember thinking, as a 12 or 13 year old kid, that the spirit of hip-music wasn't a whole lot different than the spirit of \\\"outlaw\\\" country music I had grown up hearing around my pops and uncles.\u201d Bubba recalls. \u201cThe rebellious nature of say NWA, or 2 Live Crew, or The Geto Boys, in the late 80s, early 90s just wasn't that different from the movement that guys like Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Billy Joe Shaver and others created by simply being themselves and saying what they wanted. Not to mention things were changing in rural areas, during my teenage years. The various drug epidemics had penetrated my neck of the woods, and the \\\"reality\\\" of life in the country had begun to shift. Folks were still hard working, and had traditional values, but drugs, and violence had become more prevalent, as a new generation of boys and girls, became man and women, in this environment. In some ways, the lower class, even out there where we were, started to identify as much with rap music, as country. This coincided with hip-hop, and rap exploding on popular culture, so the merging of the two genres, in terms of people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWith the first album \\\"Dark Days Bright Nights\\\" we knew the people we wanted to reach, but didn't necessarily know how to reach them. This would really be the case with \u201cDeliverance\u201d, a couple years later. We had hooked up with Organized Noize, and Timbaland, two of the most accomplished, and respected names in urban music, and they had really bought in to what we were trying to do. This was an exciting time! We were very successful with the first album, taking baby steps toward bringing the two worlds together. The lyrics, and imagery were definitely country but the music was still pretty urban leaning. In retrospect, that's probably right where we needed to be at that time. As we prepared to record the 2nd album, \\\"Deliverance\\\", it was actually Timbaland, who decided the music needed to match the lyrics and imagery. \u201c\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cAs bold as \\\"Deliverance\\\" was, it was probably too big of a leap forward to win commercially when it was released in 2003. We were still marketing, and promoting the \\\"old way\\\" and spending tons of money at radio and trying to get MTV and BET to play the video. It was also at a time when Lil John had the whole world \\\"crunk.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking back, it's actually pretty remarkable that the song and album \\\"Deliverance\\\"did as well as they did. We just didn't know how to reach the people we wererepresenting. Keep in mind there was no YouTube, and the Internet was still an infant in terms of the impact it would soon have on music. Interscope Records did the best they could, based on the way they did things at the time, but in the end we all failed miserably in thinking of ways to market an album so outside of the box.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will slap anybody who questions my right to sit at this table, and eat.

And that\u2019s before his booming country-twanged voice enters the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m just a regular fat piece of white trash with some real people that relate,\u201d he loudly explains with a wide grin, sending everyone else within earshot into riotous laughter. For the 27-year-old Jelly, a nickname he picked up from his mother and kept to honor an incarcerated friend, humor has always been a way to cope with the struggle he would go through in life. Growing up in the rougher areas of Nashville, TN, particularly the Southside city known as Antioch, Jelly got an early taste for street life and fast cash. \u201cI\u2019ve always joked that Antioch is the cultural melting pot the government uses to test how different ethnicities live together in a lower and middle class area,\u201d He laughs referring to the city\u2019s racially diverse, albeit economically bleak make up.Captivated by the gritty rhymes of local legends such as Pistol, Quanie Cash, Haystak, and Kool Daddy Fresh, it wasn\u2019t long before the music would mirror Jelly Roll\u2019s personal life. Catching his first case at age 14, Jelly would endure an ongoing cycle of incarceration until 2009 which would include intent to distribute cocaine charges and multiple probation violations.Continuing to soak up the sounds from southern artists such as UGK, 8ball & MJG, Three 6 Mafia, Chamillionare and Paul Wall, it was during these particularly dark times that Jelly would turn to crafting his own rhymes as a therapeutic means to deal with his trials and tribulations: \u201cMy music is all based on emotions and stories from my life as well as people around me. I want to convey to people the power of faith and perseverance and I hope that it helps them to find a light in whatever darkness they may be going through in there life.\u201d In the summer of 2010, Jelly Roll\u2019s \u201cPop Another Pill\u201d collaboration with Memphis luminary Lil Wyte would go on to garner over 1 million YouTube views. This viral sensation lead to the SNO group album Year-Round released on Hypnotized Minds in April 2011, a project executive-produced by Oscar winners DJ Paul and Juicy J. Jelly continued his successful 2011 campaign by releasing Gambling On A Whiteboy 4 during the summer and combining his talents with Haystak for the successful Strictly Business joint-album in November. His unique combination of introspection, melody, and punchlines has struck a chord with an ever-growing nationwide fan base and continues to impress. In between new projects, Jelly still finds time to volunteer at and provide financial backing for the local SuCO Boxing & MMA gym to help provide disadvantaged youth with a place to take part in positive activities. \u201cMy ultimate goal is to touch and reach people and have a voice of influence with the youth of today, he reveals. \u201cI know that sounds like the opposite of what I\u2019m aiming for by the content of some of my bigger songs, but the real purpose will shine through in the end. Helping people and life in general is a marathon, not a 40-yard-dash.\u201d Spoken like someone who has truly been through the fire, its evident Jelly Roll is on a path to even greater acclaim- and that means a greater change for the world.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-og.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atxl1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atxxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/37/53-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DPF9Az9srQM\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://jellyroll615.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/TheRealJellyRoll/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/jellyroll615\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"jellyroll615\"},{\"id\":1634733,\"name\":\"Struggle Jennings\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Struggle was destined to be an Outlaw..
