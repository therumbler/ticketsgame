That's where the band has come to reside, musically: deep in the pocket, that ever-elusive, funky trench where a band can entrance an audience, hypnotize it and hold on to it until the set or CD is finished.  Built on a bedrock of nasty, oceanic slabs of dubby bass, meditative vocal harmonies, rock-steady guitar licks and tightly syncopated percussive rhythms, Slightly Stoopid illustrate a case study in underground success, steeped in years of hard touring, an improvisational business model, and a creative process that continues to unwind and push the envelope of a new jam-based genre the band helped to create.\\n\\nSlightly Stoopid has built a large n' loyal fan base, and has soared to one of the most successful independent artists of this decade.

Their shows are built off the Dead's extensive catalog and the talent of these 7 fine musicians. On any given night the band will perform a show based on a set list from the Grateful Dead's 30 years of extensive touring or use their catalog to program a unique set list for the show. This allows fans both young and old to share in the experience. By recreating set lists from the past, and by developing their own sets of Dead songs, Dark Star Orchestra offers a continually evolving artistic outlet within this musical canon. Honoring both the band and the fans, Dark Star Orchestra's members seek out the unique style and sound of each era while simultaneously offering their own informed improvisations.\\n\\nDark Star Orchestra offers much more than the sound of the Grateful Dead, they truly encapsulate the energy and the experience. It's about a sense of familiarity. It's about a feeling that grabs listeners and takes over. It's about thta contagious energy... in short, it's about the complete experience and consistent quality show that the fan receives when attending a Dark Star Orchestra show.\\n\\nDark Star Orchestra has performed throughout the United States and Europe. They continue to grow their fan base by playing at larger venues for two and even three night stands as well as performing at major music festivals including Bonnaroo, All Good Festival, Gathering of the Vibes, Mountain Jam, Summer Camp, Wakarusa and 10,000 Lakes.

The band has featured guest performances from five original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann, Donna Jean Godchaux-MacKay, Vince Welnick, Tom Constanten and even toured with longtime Dead soundman, Dan Healy. Other notable guests have included Mike Gordon and Jon Fishman of Phish, Keller Williams, Warren Haynes, Steve Kimock, Peter Rowan, Ramblin' Jack Elliot and many more.\\n\\n\\\"For us it's a chance to recreate some of the magic that was created for us over the years,\\\" rhythm guitarist and vocalist Rob Eaton explains. \\\"We offer a sort of a historical perspective at what it might have been like to go to a show in 1985, 1978 or whenever.

The more sorrow, laughter and adventure experienced, the more interesting curves and crevices are carved into an artist's songs.  The miles traveled leave rich lines in the verses that only time, misadventure, and hard-won wisdom can produce.  Anders Osborne is a map of intensely felt, passionately engaged living, a fractured but healing topography of heartbreak and hope for fellow travelers to explore.  \\n\\nOsborne's music is redolent of the blues bathed in West Coast sunshine and brotherly compassion, a torchbearer for rock 'n' roll with blood in it's veins and a heart in it's hands. His long awaited new full length, Spacedust & Ocean Views, offers up graceful songwriting and signature guitar work on one of the strongest releases in his storied career. A strong sense of place runs through the album. From an evocation of geography to a questioning of one's place in the universe, big ideas are condensed in thoughtful, smoothly swinging ways. It's the album his fans have been waiting for- one that only he can deliver. \\n\\n\\\"These twelve songs speak about places dear to me, places I feel something profound about, but there's also the presence of the universe,\\\" explains Osborne. \\\"I think one of the main struggles we all face is the separation from unity. I want to understand how I can feel unified with the world and others, with the universe writ large. I can arrange the ideas intellectually but the feeling of longing remains. The whole thing is a mystery, sometimes a sad, baffling mystery and sometimes very enchanting, but overall I just don't understand and want to desperately. That's what this music is, an attempt to understand it all.\\\" \\nAnd what an attempt it is. \\n\\nProducer Mark Howard (Bob Dylan, Daniel Lanois, Iggy Pop) uses Osborne's seasoned, searching voice like a river running through the song cycle. It's a distinctly human element that continually tenderizes the listener as his sinewy, emotionally charged guitar dances with longtime bassist Carl Dufrene, guitar foil Scott Metzger (Joe Russo's Almost Dead), and the shared drumming of Brady Blade and Tony Leone. New Orleans percussion master Johnny Vidacovich, bassist James Singleton, and pop-jazz legend Rickie Lee Jones join Osborne for the cosmically charged album closer \\\"From Space.\\\" On the other hand, Spacedust's lead single \\\"Lafayette\\\" is a roots-fueled rocker- a track that finds Osborne simultaneously sticking to his guns and exploring new territory as an artist.\\n\\nThis special collection of compositions is the culmination of years of writing and touring. \\\"This is the last chapter before something new emerges.  I'm wrapping some stuff up and figuring some fresh stuff out,\\\" says Osborne, who's been moving beyond his complicated past for close to a decade.  \\\"Now my life is about a human experience in a larger sense.  Now, I feel I'm standing on my own two feet, trying to be a grown man doing the right thing.\\\" In an ever changing musical landscape, Spacedust & Ocean Views firmly plants Anders Osborne as one of American music's elite guitarists and songwriters.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atjmbo.jpeg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atjmbo1.jpeg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atlg.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atlg1.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atmd.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atmd1.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-og.jpeg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":683},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atsm.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atsm1.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-sq.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-sqsm.jpeg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atxl.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atxxl.jpeg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/66/53-atxxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.andersosborne.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"https://myspace.com/andersosbornenola\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.Facebook.com/AndersOsborne\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Anders_Osborne\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Anders_Osborne\"},{\"id\":1718207,\"name\":\"Twiddle\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"With roots at Vermont's Castleton State University, Twiddle began their extensive touring career in 2005.

They've released three full-length studio albums, including their most recent studio pass, the acclaimed The Weather Below.\\n\\nNow, Sister Sparrow & The Dirty Birds will finally appease its flock of devotees by releasing its first live album \u2013 Fowl Play.  The album was recorded on New Year's Eve before a raucous, sold-out crowd in Fairfield, Connecticut and was the beautiful, accidental result of an original New Year's Eve plan gone awry.  After losing their New Year's Eve gig just weeks before the big night, the band made proverbial lemonade, securing an alternate venue at the last moment, packing the house, putting on their biggest party to date and recording it for the world to hear.\\n\\nFowl Play captures the unbridled live energy for which Sister Sparrow & The Dirty Birds has become famous and finds the band rollicking through catalogue favorites past and present.  The album also features a brand new song entitled \\\"Frankie\\\" and a deeply soulful, overwhelmingly powerful rendition of Aretha Franklin's \\\"Dr. Feelgood\\\".\\n\\n\\\"They may be from Brooklyn, but the fiery brass- and gospel-infused funk emanating from Sister Sparrow & The Dirty Birds is rooted in Memphis soul,\\\" writes the LA Times.  \\\"Their rhythmic wheelhouse combines big-city grit and down-home sweetness with a little bit of Americana twang.\\\"\\n\\nThe band has shared the stage with Gov't Mule, Dr. John, Trombone Shorty, The Avett Brothers, and Galactic and has turned audiences into believers through appearances on the festival circuit at Bonnaroo, Firefly, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, Bottle Rock, Forecastle and others.\\n\\nUltimately, Sister Sparrow & The Dirty Birds stand poised to shake up rock 'n' roll all around the world. \\\"This all stems back to why I loved performing and singing to begin with,\\\" Arleigh leaves off. \\\"I want to make crowds happy and see them smile and dance.

Sometimes, inspiration stems from a place that everyone can relate to, but maybe no one's actually been.
