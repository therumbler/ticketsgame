Greyhounds\",\"startTime\":\"2016-11-25 22:30:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"\\\"The war is on for your mind,\\\" sings Anthony Farrell, one half of the soulful Austin duo Greyhounds, \\\"and we're on the same side.\\\" Arriving midway through the band's adventurous new album, 'Change Of Pace,' the line serves as a powerful refrain, with Farrell's voice peaking in intensity over musical partner Andrew Trube's chirping electric guitar. But more than just a memorable hook, it's an encapsulation of the shift in consciousness that defines the album, Greyhounds' second\u2014and finest\u2014collection of funky, blues\u00adand\u00adR&B\u00adlaced rock and roll for the iconic Ardent label.\\r\\n\\\"It's a reflection of the times that we're living in,\\\" explains Farrell. \\\"As an adult these days, you can't help but feel like you're being bombarded by all these people trying to influence you one way or another to their type of thinking. There's this polarization of American culture where you're either on our side or you're against us, and I don't think that really helps anybody.\\\"\\r\\nSuch are the politics of Greyhounds, less concerned with your particular point of view than with your ability to come to an informed one that's true to your own moral compass. Where their last album, 2014's acclaimed 'Accumulator,' focused on internal emotional turmoil and personal relationships, 'Change Of Pace' draws its inspiration from the outside world and the struggles the duo sees every day in Texas and on the road.\\r\\n\\\"This record has a lot more to do with what's around us and our perceptions of that,\\\" explains Trube, who splits songwriting and singing duties with Farrell. \\\"We're passionate about what's going on right now, and it's not necessarily 'political,' but as an artist, I feel like it's our duty to provide this looking glass for people to see what's going on around them and encourage them to wake up and start taking care of the world and each other.\\\"\\r\\nTrube and Farrell first met while living in California, where an L.A. Weekly classified ad brought them together. The connection between the guitarist and keyboard player was instantaneous, and the remarkable magic they conjure together has since earned them widespread attention from critics and peers alike. Derek Trucks raved that \\\"Greyhounds make real music, the right way and for the right reasons,\\\" while JJ Grey described their songs as landing \\\"somewhere between a heartfelt hymn and the dirtiest jank you've ever heard in your life,\\\" and Gary Clark Jr. summed up a recent LA show by tweeting simply that they \\\"crushed it as usual.\\\" Meanwhile, Esquire hailed their debut as \\\"intoxicating [and] gut\u00adwrenchingly lovely,\\\" USA Today compared them to \\\"The Meters, Earl Hooker and Buck Owens,\\\" and Texas\\r\\n\ufffcMonthly fell under the spell of their \\\"ringing guitar...bluesy swagger, and all the pain a strained falsetto can convey.\\\"\\r\\nBesides their unique ability to finish each other's musical sentences, the duo also bonded over a shared love of rescued gear. 'Accumulator' highlighted Farrell's collection of rewired vintage keyboards and Trube's extensive collection of antique guitars (all of them purchased for under $100), and 'Change Of Pace' finds them taking their DIY sonic approach to the next level.\\r\\n\\\"Farrell and I produced this record ourselves, and we're real proud of the risks we took,\\\" says Trube. \\\"In most recording situations we've ever been in, we've had a producer telling us the 'right' and the 'wrong' way to go about things, but this time around, we just went for the sounds we thought would be cool. We'd have crazy ideas like hanging an amp on the showerhead in the bathroom and putting a microphone in the hallway with the door open, just trying to experiment with whatever equipment we had.\\\"\\r\\nIt wasn't all purely DIY, though, as the band recorded some of the tracks at the legendary Ardent Studios in Memphis, which has hosted everyone from Led Zeppelin and Big Star to The Staple Singers and Booker T. and the MGs in its storied history.\\r\\n\\\"It's incredible to record at Ardent,\\\" says Farrell. \\\"It's inspiring, but at the same time it kind of lends this gravity to things. It made us feel the importance of what we're doing and of making it something that can last beyond the time that we're here and hopefully inspire others that come after us. We were given this opportunity to record in this place with all this history, and we felt like we had a responsibility to do it justice.\\\"\\r\\nThat responsibility rings out loud and clear in songs like the slow\u00adburning come\u00adtogether anthem \\\"Walls\\\"\u2014where Farrell sings \\\"What happened to the feeling that we can make a change?\\\"\u2014and \\\"Sizzle\\\"\u2014which finds Farrell reflecting, \\\"So many people just don't seem to care / They think that it doesn't matter because it's happening over there / But they forget that all nations used to be one / Living under the same sun.\\\" There are lighter moments, to be sure, like the playful, Trube\u00adpenned \\\"Late Night Slice,\\\" in addition to the deep wells of emotion that bubble up on the heartbroken \\\"Cuz I'm Here\\\" and the funky \\\"For You,\\\" but across the board, the album showcases the remarkable artistic maturation the band has undergone in the\\r\\nshort time since releasing 'Accumulator.'\\r\\nDespite the varied subject matter and recording approaches, Farrell and Trube's singular blend as songwriters proves to be the unifying thread that ties together all of the disparate, daring sounds and ambitious lyrical work.\\r\\n\\\"We're both two different guys, but once a song goes through our filter together, it's just Greyhounds,\\\" explains Trube. \\\"I might have written the majority of the lyrics for some particular tune, but all in all, it wouldn't sound like it does if it hadn't had been Farrell and I working on it together. Every song has to go through the Farrell\u00adTrube filter before it's put on the record. That's what makes the sound that we create.\\\"\\r\\nIf 'Change Of Pace' is any indication, the Farrell\u00adTrube filter is working in peak condition right now, and the timing couldn't be any better. The war is on for your mind, and Greyhounds' new album is without a doubt a win for the good guys.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atjmbo.PNG\",\"width\":530,\"height\":545},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atjmbo1.PNG\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atlg.PNG\",\"width\":300,\"height\":308},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atlg1.PNG\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atmd.PNG\",\"width\":200,\"height\":206},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atmd1.PNG\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-og.PNG\",\"width\":530,\"height\":545},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atsm.PNG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":103},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atsm1.PNG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-sq.PNG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-sqsm.PNG\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atxl.PNG\",\"width\":500,\"height\":514},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atxl1.PNG\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atxxl.PNG\",\"width\":530,\"height\":545},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/23/75-atxxl1.PNG\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"ZDspdfQSdh8\",\"title\":\"Greyhounds - \\\"What's On Your Mind\\\"\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDspdfQSdh8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDspdfQSdh8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.greyhoundsmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/greyhoundsmusic/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Greyhoundsmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Greyhoundsmusic\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1758061,\"name\":\"Kevin Gordon\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\\\"Dude's a juke-joint professor emeritus.\\\"--Wil Hermes, Rolling Stone, 3/12\\n\\n\\\"What just happened? I'm knocked out, I'm flat on my can. Where did Kevin Gordon come from and how have I missed him for so long?\\\"--Jed Gottlieb, Boston Herald\\n\\n\\\". . .Kevin Gordon lyrically seduced his fans at Jazz Fest as he spun musical tales of life\\nin the conflicted modern South.\\\"--New Orleans Times-Picayune\\n\\nKevin Gordon's voice is made from dust and red clay. And the songs on the Louisiana-born performer's sweeping new album Gloryland are chiseled from the bedrock of life \u2014 the honest facts of rambling, needing, loving, soul-searching and experience.\\n\\n\\\"I like the unfinished ending \u2014 the story that just continues when the song's over,\\\" says Gordon. \\\"Life never sums itself up in three-and-a-half minutes, and a good song doesn't need to do that either. But it should tell a story.\\\"\\n\\nAll 11 numbers on Gloryland have an elemental feel \u2014 proof that Gordon's working at the peak of the songwriter's craft. His characters, from the school kid narrating the coming-of-age yarn \\\"Colfax/Step in Time\\\" to the panhandler in \\\"Trying To Get To Memphis\\\" to the folk artist Pecolia Warner, the subject of his lovely duet with fellow Americana singer-songwriter Sarah Siskind, \\\"Pecolia's Star,\\\" have a depth and personality that brings Gordon's songs of the South into sharp focus, even if their essential questions about the mysteries of faith, truth and humanity hang in the air as he moves on to the next tale.\\n\\nIt's not just Gordon's poetic vision and the raw character etched in his sinewy voice that gives his fifth studio album such remarkable substance. He and producer/multi-instrumentalist Joe McMahan have created a fresh, dynamic sonic approach for Gloryland that's equally deep.\\n\\nMcMahan built a low-end foundation around the gutty, gritty dialog that Gordon maintains with his vintage electric Gibson hollow body guitar that's anchored by two full drums kits and buoyed by careful mixing. That keeps the spotlight focused keenly on Gordon's spare, evocative singing and playing, and gives the songs an uncluttered feel that contributes to their sense of place.\\n\\n\\\"I was skeptical at first, but as the album began to take shape that approach really allowed me to let the songs take their course,\\\" Gordon says. \\\"This time around I concentrated on narrative more, whereas on the last studio album, (2005's O Come Look at the Burning), it was more about vibe and capturing the essence of something. For Gloryland, I wanted the stories to be literal. And if I can write a song that tells a literal, linear story and I can still feel myself getting emotional over what I'm writing about, then I know I'm getting somewhere.\\\"\\n\\nGordon's own narrative begins in Monroe, Louisiana, where he \\\"grew up the son of well-intentioned, but backsliding parents. I was a very confused young man.\\\"\\n\\nLike many other children of the 1970s who fit that description, Gordon wrote poetry and discovered skate-boarding and punk rock despite being weaned on the region's early rock, blues, honky-tonk and rockabilly sounds. He sang in a high school band whose repertoire was entirely Ramones and Sex Pistols covers. But his own fusion of words and music ignited after a girlfriend's parents gave him a guitar and he discovered the more literate and worldly compositions of the influential Los Angeles roots- punk outfit X.\\n\\nIn the late-'80s Gordon moved to Iowa City, where he studied poetry and graduated with a masters degree from the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. At the same time, he became indoctrinated in the world of the working musician. Gordon graduated from blues jams to playing guitar in a regionally touring band led by Bo Ramsey, who went on to become a producer and guitarist for Greg Brown and Lucinda Williams.\\n\\nWhen Ramsey took a hiatus, Gordon began fronting his own group and writing his own songs, which he's continued to do for more than 20 years. He moved to Tennessee in 1992, and four years later recorded the numbers that would become his first nationally distributed album, Cadillac Jack's #1 Son, with producer Garry Tallent of the E Street Band, which was released in 1998 on Shanachie.\\n\\nGordon also has his own connection to Lucinda Williams, who he befriended in Nashville. She sang on the track \\\"Down To the Well,\\\" which was the title of his 2000 album and one of the most popular cuts on the 6th annual Oxford American Southern Music Sampler. The song also appeared on No Depression's What It Sounds Like compilation.\\n\\n\\\"Many fans have discovered me because of that,\\\" says Gordon. His songs have been cut by a host of artists. Keith Richards and Levon Helm performed Gordon's and Gwil Owen's \\\"Deuce And A Quarter\\\" with Scotty Moore on the former Elvis Presley guitarist's 1996 solo album. New Orleans soul queen Irma Thomas recorded \\\"Flowers\\\" from O Come Look At the Burning on her Grammy-winning post-Katrina album After the Rain. Southside Johnny, Webb Wilder and Kate Campbell have also covered Gordon's songs. And in 2009 Gordon issued his own live tracks, demos and rarities collection, Salvage & Drift Vol. 1, which examines his musical history in previously unreleased recordings from 1994 through that year.\\n\\n\\\"When I write a song, I have nobody else in mind but myself,\\\" Gordon says. \\\"When I first started writing songs it seemed like absolute freedom for me \u2014 exactly the opposite of what I was experiencing in the Writers' Workshop. Except for the year when I had a publishing contract and discovered writing by numbers was anathema to me, that's what it's been about ever since.\\\"\\n\\nSo it's no wonder that occasionally Gordon follows his muse to unusual places. Gloryland's \\\"Black Dog\\\" was inspired as much by his own middle-aged angst as by the rescued pit bill his family keeps. And in the title track he gets inside the heads of both a desperate evangelical and a bomb- strapped jihadist as he plumbs the religious undercurrents that flow through several of the disc's tunes.\\n\\n\\\"I tend to write about preachers and religion because they scared me so much as a kid,\\\" he offers. \\\"For a while, my mom and stepdad went to a charismatic church where people would 'get the spirit' and fall out on the floor. It was fascinating and horrifying, and I sometimes still don't know what to make of it.\\\"\\n\\nA more blithe spiritual theme underlies \\\"Pecolia's Star,\\\" the duet with Siskind, a friend of Gordon's who has written songs for Allison Krauss and Bon Iver. The lyrics are in the voice of the late Mississippi folk artist Pecolia Warner, who saw her captivating, colorful quilting as an extension of God's positive influence on Earth.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, Gordon's connection with Warner and, more broadly, the creative outsiders of the folk art world is significant.\\n\\n\\\"For 15 years I've been obsessed with contemporary self-taught art to the point where I've opened a gallery in my house,\\\" he explains. \\\"But what's really been inspiring about entering this world has been getting to know artists like Mose Tolliver and Jimmy Lee Sudduth.\\n\\n\\\"These people started making art of their own volition,\\\" Gordon continues. \\\"They already worked long days at hard jobs, often in the fields, and there was no market for their art, no dealers at their doors (until they were discovered and exhibited). That really reinforced, for me, the basic reason why I write and perform my songs \u2014 which is because I feel like I have to.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":720,\"height\":480},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":720,\"height\":480},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-og.jpg\",\"width\":720,\"height\":480},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/83/35-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.kevingordon.net\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/kevingordonmusic\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/kevingordonmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/kevingordonmuzk\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"kevingordonmuzk\"},{\"id\":1730077,\"name\":\"Chris Johnson\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Chris Johnson, singer, songwriter and lead for Telegraph Canyon.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-og.jpg\",\"width\":1500,\"height\":1000},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/31/59-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://shippingandreceiving.ticketfy.com1369247?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
