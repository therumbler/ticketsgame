Kottke\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Acoustic guitarist Leo Kottke was born in Athens, Georgi\\r\\na, but left town after a year and \\r\\na half. Raised in 12 different states, he absorbed a \\r\\nvariety of musical influences as a \\r\\nchild, flirting with both violin and trombone, befor\\r\\ne abandoning Stravinsky for the guitar \\r\\nat age 11. \\r\\nAfter adding a love for the country-blues of Mississipp\\r\\ni John Hurt to the music of John \\r\\nPhillip Sousa and Preston Epps, Kottke joined the Navy \\r\\nunderage, to be underwater, \\r\\nand eventually lost some hearing shooting at lightbulb\\r\\ns in the Atlantic while serving on \\r\\nthe USS Halfbeak, a diesel submarine. \\r\\nKottke had previously entered college at the U of Missou\\r\\nri, dropping out after a year to \\r\\nhitchhike across the country to South Carolina, then to \\r\\nNew London and into the Navy, \\r\\nwith his twelve string. \\\"The trip was not something I\\r\\n enjoyed,\\\" he has said, \\\"I was broke \\r\\nand met too many interesting people.\\\" \\r\\nDischarged in 1964, he settled in the Twin Cities area\\r\\n and became a fixture at \\r\\nMinneapolis' Scholar Coffeehouse, which had been home\\r\\n to Bob Dylan and John \\r\\nKoerner. He issued his 1968 recording debut LP Twelve\\r\\n String Blues, recorded on a \\r\\nViking quarter-inch tape recorder, for the Scholar's t\\r\\niny Oblivion label. (The label \\r\\nreleased one other LP by The Langston Hughes Memorial\\r\\n Eclectic Jazz Band.) \\r\\nAfter sending tapes to guitarist John Fahey, Kottke was\\r\\n signed to Fahey's Takoma label, \\r\\nreleasing what has come to be called the Armadillo rec\\r\\nord. Fahey and his manager \\r\\nDenny Bruce soon secured a production deal for Kottke wi\\r\\nth Capitol Records. \\r\\nKottke's 1971 major-label debut, \\\"Mudlark,\\\" positioned\\r\\n him somewhat uneasily in the \\r\\nsinger/songwriter vein, despite his own wishes to remain\\r\\n an instrumental performer. Still, \\r\\ndespite arguments with label heads as well as with Bru\\r\\nce, Kottke flourished during his \\r\\ntenure on Capitol, as records like 1972's \\\"Greenhouse\\\" a\\r\\nnd 1973's live \\\"My Feet Are \\r\\nSmiling\\\" and \\\"Ice Water\\\" found him branching out with\\r\\n guest musicians and honing his \\r\\nguitar technique. \\r\\nWith 1975's Chewing Pine, Kottke reached the U.S. Top \\r\\n30 for the second time; he also \\r\\ngained an international following thanks to his contin\\r\\nuing tours in Europe and Australia. \\r\\nHis\\r\\ncollaboration with Phish bassist Mike Gordon, \\\"Clone,\\\" c\\r\\naught audiences' attention in \\r\\n2002. Kottke and Gordon followed with a recording i\\r\\nn the Bahamas called \\\"Sixty Six \\r\\nSteps,\\\" produced by Leo's old friend and Prince produce\\r\\nr David Z. \\r\\nKottke has been awarded two Grammy nominations; a Doct\\r\\norate in Music Performance \\r\\nby the Peck School of Music at the U of Wisconsin, Milwau\\r\\nkee; and a Certificate of \\r\\nSignificant Achievement in Not Playing the Trombone f\\r\\nrom the U of Texas at Brownsville \\r\\nwith Texas Southmost College.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":639},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-og.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":852},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/17-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1764922,\"name\":\"Keller Williams\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Those who\u2019ve followed Keller Williams\u2019 recording career to date know that he has given each of his albums a single-syllable title: FREEK, BUZZ, SPUN, BREATHE, LOOP, LAUGH, HOME, DANCE, STAGE, GRASS, DREAM, TWELVE, LIVE, ODD, THIEF, KIDS, BASS, PICK, FUNK, and most recently, VAPE (released April 20, 2015). Each title serves not only as a concise summation of the concept guiding the particular project but also as another piece of the jigsaw puzzle that is Keller Williams. GRASS, for example, is a bluegrass recording, cut with the husband-wife duo the Keels. STAGE is a live album and DREAM the end product of a wish list: Keller collaborating with some of his greatest musical heroes. THIEF is a set of unexpected cover songs. And KIDS offers up, you guessed it, Williams\u2019 first and possibly only children\u2019s record.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe naming trend continued with 2012\u2019s BASS and PICK, respectively a set of songs where Keller plays bass and William\u2019s collaboration with royal bluegrass family The Travelin\u2019 McCourys. With VAPE, released in April 2015 \u2013 Keller celebrates his 20th official album release. What all of the titles reveal, when taken together, is an artist of great stylistic breadth and infinite imagination, a singer, songwriter and musician, always on a quest for the new. Keller Williams has never followed the prescribed path laid out by the conventional music business, nor has he taken the prescribed meds laid out by his team of conventional doctors. Instead, he has taken the A.D.D. path (Artistic, Determined, Dedication). It\u2019s a path that has served him quite well.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince he first appeared on the scene in the early \u201990s, Williams has defined the term independent artist. And his recordings tell only half the story. Keller built his reputation initially on his engaging live performances, no two of which are ever alike. For most of his career he has performed solo. His stage shows are rooted around Keller singing his compositions and choice cover songs, while accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. With the use of today\u2019s technology, Keller creates samples on the fly in front of the audience, a technique called live phrase sampling or looping, With nothing pre-recorded, the end result often leans toward a hybrid of alternative folk and groovy electronica. A genre Keller jokingly calls \u201cacoustic dance music\u201d or ADM.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat approach, Williams explains, was derived from \u201chours of playing solo with just a guitar and a microphone, and then wanting to go down different avenues musically. I couldn\u2019t afford humans and didn\u2019t want to step into the cheesy world of automated sequencers where you hit a button and the whole band starts to play, then you\u2019ve got to solo along or sing on top of it. I wanted something more organic yet with a dance groove that I could create myself.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams\u2019 solo live shows\u2014and his ability to improvise to his determinedly quirky tunes despite the absence of an actual band\u2014quickly became the stuff of legend, and his audience grew exponentially when word spread about this exciting, unpredictable performer. Once he began releasing recordings, starting with 1994\u2019s FREEK, Williams was embraced by an even wider community of music fans, particularly the jam band crowd. While his live gigs have largely been solo affairs, Williams has nearly always used his albums as a forum for collaborations with fellow musicians. An alliance with The String Cheese Incident on 1999\u2019s BREATHE marked Williams\u2019 first release on the band\u2019s label SCI Fidelity Records, an imprint he still partners with today for recordings. DREAM, Keller\u2019s 2007 release, found him in the company of such iconic musicians as the Grateful Dead\u2019s Bob Weir, banjo master B\u00e9la Fleck, bass great Victor Wooten, American musician/poet Michael Franti and many others.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1391},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":435},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":290},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-og.jpg\",\"width\":1413,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":145},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":725},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":942},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/82/21-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://variety-playhouse.com/event/1377072?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
