Notes rise and suffuse the silence; are joined by a deep bass drone, a quiet pulse of cello and a percussive tick: daybreak made music.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat first sound on the lead track, \\\"Hello You Who,\\\" is a steel guitar, and its cinematic swell foreshadows the exploration of new territory by this beloved Rocky Mountain ensemble. A new band member and the introduction of instruments like the pedal steel and the cello into their already impressive treasure trove of strings and percussion are just the beginning. Petals embodies a deepening, as the quintet dives into themes of loss and rebirth, time and memory, love unbound by body or farewell. \\\"Hello you who moves with me in a dance/Hello you who moves me like the sea/\u2026Who loves me Love loves me just to be.\\\" This hello is both a celebration of unconditional love and an invitation to join Elephant Revival in its wayfaring.\\r\\nThe death of a close friend having left its indelible mark on the band, many of the songs on Petals represent what guitarist Daniel Rodriguez calls \\\"an honoring and a coping.\\\" But this is not an album about despair or darkness; it's a thanksgiving and a prayer for what endures and returns. \\\"She thanks the sky, and she walks the earth/\u2026To the broken-hearted, to the burdened, too/To everyone, peace tonight\\\" (\\\"Peace Tonight\\\"). This idea is embodied in the very name Elephant Revival: moved by the separation and subsequent death of three elephants at the Chicago zoo, bass and mandolin player Dango Rose was inspired to busk in front of what was once their enclosure. Not just a gesture, but a true endeavor to create meaning and grace from loss. Petals, the band's fourth album, is, in fact, a revival.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs ever, Nature is both a real and metaphorical touchstone in Elephant Revival's work, from the petals pressed into the book of memory in the title track (\\\"These petals intended for giving release\\\"), to the seasons spinning through death and rebirth in \\\"Season Song.\\\" There are intimations too, of the ominous vulnerability of Nature to our darker impulses. In \\\"Raindrops,\\\" Bonnie Paine sings, \\\"Raindrops on the rooftops he said/Just stop and listen/Constant as the earthquakes.\\\" She is both warning of the real effects of fracking and reminding us that a remedy may lie in deep listening\u2014to each other and to the earth itself. The band's commitment to community and the environment remains at the core of their music.\\r\\n\\r\\nElephant Revival's music maintains its roots in American and Celtic songcraft, but on Petals, they achieve a compositional maturity that in moments can evoke the modern classical ensemble. Spare, almost conversational strings punctuate the rhythmic momentum in songs like the title track and the almost archetypically stark Celtic narrative, \\\"Furthest Shore,\\\" a continuation of the story told in the song \\\"Currach\\\" from their first 2008 self-titled release. The icy drama of the North Sea inhabits those percussive strings and resounding drums. This kind of intensity recurs in other songs, like \\\"When I Fall,\\\" a Dango Rose-penned shout-out for transcendence through trial, whose unison power chorus brings to mind Pink Floyd's The Wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassion arises from compassion on this album; tenderness and wildness go hand in hand. Dan Rodriguez' voice on wholehearted folk songs like \\\"On and On\\\" and \\\"Home In Your Heart\\\" is a gentle counterpoint to Paine's vocal intensity, and the songwriting overall describes a wide arc. Just follow Bridget Law's expressive fiddle through the course of the album to hear the moan of the blues, the lyricism of the folk ballad, the elegant bones of the chamber piece, the bluegrass punch. All the earthy rhythms, eclectic influences and the rich instrumental brew that Elephant Revival fans cherish are here. But eclecticism, though a key feature of their sound, has never been the point. For these multi-instrumentalists, these singers and writers, sound and song serve one another: the play between instrumentation, composition, emotion and restraint is an organic unfolding. Paine, for example, has never recorded or performed on the cello before this album, but she's written songs on it for years, so if her throaty cello somehow sounds like a deep extension of her voice, it is. And if new band member Charlie Rose's magnetic pedal steel conjures ghosts\u2014of love, of landscapes\u2014it's because Petals is haunted by those things.\\r\\n\\r\\nElephant Revival's is the music of connection\u2014kin-folk\u2014and the message of Petals, their most intimate album to date, is not how life is about loss, but rather how much life there is in loss, how much potency, how much love. The ghost of the beloved in the final track \\\"Close As Can Be\\\" is not, after all, far away. \\\"\u2026I feel you near/You're lifting the leaves/Saying to me/We'll be close as can be.\\\" The hello of the first song has gone on a musical odyssey and found in the end, in goodbye, its mirror image: the promise once more of unending and unconditional love.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1440},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-og.jpg\",\"width\":1366,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":975},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/64/61-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://elephantrevival.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/elephantrevival\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/elephantrevival\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/elephantrevival\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"elephantrevival\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1720089,\"name\":\"Gipsy Moon\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Gipsy Moon is a four-piece group of wandering artists on an endless journey toward good times and raw expression. With music as their carriage, strings as their weapon and the horizon as their aim, this unconventional band is not one to be missed. Their sound, often referred to as Gipsygrass, is something like a backwoods hoedown meets the smoking basement of a New York jazz club. Their soothing harmonies, raging solos and dirt encrusted bass lines bring an old time style into an exciting new dimension; one that hippies and poets, lovers and dancers, freaks and families alike can all come together and move in ways that their bodies have never known.\\n\\nThe members, made up of Silas Herman (guitar/mandolin), David Matters (banjo/vocals/guitar) Mackenzie Page (guitar/vocals/tenor guitar/washboard) and Collin Huff (bass/vocals/guitar) all take rest in the windy mountains of Nederland, Colorado. When they are not on the move you can find them here, forming cantos high up in the Rockies, making herbal concoctions out of the local flora or sharing a glistening jug of homebrew around a blazing campfire. This is but a small glimpse into the source of their musical inspiration. The content of most of their lyrics is a tasteful blend of nature based love songs, anti-establishment sing-alongs and down home simplicity with a gentle kiss of civil disobedience. They create music that is meant to plant inspiration in the soul and start a fire in the heart. They perform with the intention to build community and to invoke love in its wildest manifestation. They travel in order to experience life to its fullest and to build bridges that connect the frayed ends of the crumbling establishment to a new and beautiful way of existence. If one should ever come upon an opportunity to see Gipsy Moon, whether on the stage, in the woods or even sleeping in your back yard, they should be pleased at prospect of kicking off their shoes, smiling to the heavens and getting down and dirty to some rowdy ass picking.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":350,\"height\":233},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":350,\"height\":233},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-og.jpg\",\"width\":350,\"height\":233},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":350,\"height\":233},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":350,\"height\":233},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":350,\"height\":233},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/92/81-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":350,\"height\":233}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.gipsymoon.net\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/gipsymoonmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/gipsymoonband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"gipsymoonband\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1308789?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
