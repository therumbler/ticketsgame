Drawing their inspiration from art and philosophy, Fear of Men deliberately juxtaposes iconic museum imagery and lyrical themes of loneliness and fragmentation with buoyant pop melodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile studying for a Fine Art & History of Art degree, Jessica Weiss (vocals + guitar) was exhibiting some of her home recordings of ambient soundtracks to short films when these recordings caught the attention of Daniel Falvey (guitar). The two began swapping mix tapes and started a friendship based on a shared love of melody and an eclectic mix of artists such as The Chills, Grouper, Neutral Milk Hotel, The Magnetic Fields, and The Byrds, ultimately leading to the start of a more pop-focused project which they called Fear of Men.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting out, the duo recorded their music on a 4-track and transferred it onto their laptops, which Jess would then use as part of her degree work. They uploaded their songs to bandcamp which immediately caught the attention of UK blogs. Enlisting the help of friends to play drums and bass, Fear of Men approached DIY promoters and immediately began playing live shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nFear of Men, completed by Michael Miles (drums) and Robyn Edwards (bass), began releasing singles on DIY and independent UK labels and capturing the attention of Pitchfork, NME, Gorilla vs. Bear, Stereogum, The Fader, Drowned in Sound and topping the Hype Machine charts. For a wider introduction into North America, Fear of Men is releasing \\\"Early Fragments\\\" (February 12, 2013 on Kanine Records) a reverse chronological collection of their previous single releases, many of which were only available in Europe on limited edition 7\\\" and cassette pressings.\\r\\n\\r\\nFans of Broadcast and Julie Doiron will instantly gravitate toward Jess' tender vocals and melodies. The songs are beguilingly sweet while the lyrics are often bleakly nihilistic, meaning that you'll find yourself singing along to these intelligent, well-crafted pop songs while unwittingly sinking deeper into Fear of Men's world.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":800,\"height\":513},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":800,\"height\":513},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":192},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":192},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":128},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":128},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-og.jpg\",\"width\":800,\"height\":513},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":64},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":64},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":321},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":321},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":417},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/13/57-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":417}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://fearofmen.bandcamp.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/fearofmen\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/fearofmen\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"fearofmen\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1562611,\"name\":\"Weaves\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"In a little over two short years, Weaves have gone from a collection of voice memos on Jasmyn Burke's iPhone to establishing themselves as one of the most stridently individual acts to emerge from Toronto's fertile and multifaceted DIY scene. Led by the collaborative efforts of Jasmyn Burke and Morgan Waters, the band have built a devoted audience while capturing the attention of the international media with a brand of ebullient, art-damaged pop music as difficult to categorize as it is to ignore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group began in a series of sessions in the bedroom of Water's Chinatown apartment, where Waters and Burke would record increasingly elaborate demos built from Burke's phone full of songs. They transitioned to a full band line up in late 2013, adding bassist Zach Bines and drummer Spencer Cole, and quickly set to work recording their debut EP which was released on Buzz Records in the summer of 2014. The EP made an immediate splash, garnering praise from Noisey, Rookie and Spin, and earning Weaves a \\\"band to watch\\\" tag from Rolling Stone. Glowing write ups of the band's performances at that year's CMJ from The Guardian and NME followed, cementing Weaves' reputation as one of the year's most exciting new bands. \\r\\n\\r\\nWord continued to spread in 2015 with the release of their single \\\"Tick,\\\" ahead of the band's first European tour, which included dates with Hinds, Dan Deacon and Pissed Jeans, and appearances at Glastonbury and Iceland Airwaves. With their already sterling live show only sharpened by their time on the road, the band returned to CMJ in October and emerged as one of the hottest acts of the festival, earning \\\"best of the festival\\\" write ups from NPR and The New York Times among others, and further building the anticipation for their forthcoming full length. \\r\\n\\r\\nWeaves have been working on their debut LP for almost as long as they have been a band, tracking with Leon Taheny (Dilly Dally, Owen Pallett, Austra) in sessions that span most of the last two years. Mixed by Alex Newport (Death Cab for Cutie, Melvins, At The Drive In) and mastered by John Greenham (Death Grips, Sky Ferreira), the result is an album that traverses the band's history, exploring every facet of their always adventurous approach to pop music and leaving no idea unexplored. Filled beyond bursting with hooks and possibilities, it's the sound of a band propelled forward by the thrill of discovering the limits of their sound and gleefully pushing past them. \\\"We're always trying to push ourselves,\\\" says Waters, \\\"sometimes it feels like bands aren't necessary, like they're not the one's pushing music forward, so I think we're trying to hopefully prove that bands aren't boring. If we are going to be a band and if we are going to do this guitar, bass and drums thing then we might as well see how much we can fuck it up.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":959,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-og.jpg\",\"width\":959,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":501},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":651},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/70/85-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.weavesband.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/weavesmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Weeaves\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Weeaves\"},{\"id\":1759717,\"name\":\"Yohuna\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Yohuna is the synth-pop project of Wisconsin-born songwriter Johanne [yo-HUN-ah] Swanson.
