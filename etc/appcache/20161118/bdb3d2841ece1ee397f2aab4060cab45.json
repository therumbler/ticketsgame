We play in bigger clubs and theaters, there\u2019s a killer light show, and we\u2019re as loud as your favorite rock band. It\u2019s not easy to make five acoustic instruments sound like this \u2013 it\u2019s something we\u2019ve spent years working on.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom these seemingly irreconcilable elements, the five members of Greensky Bluegrass have forged a defiant, powerful sound that, while rooted in classic stringband Americana, extends outwards with a fearless, exploratory zeal. The tension and release between these components \u2013 tradition and innovation, prearranged songs and improvisation, acoustic tones and electric volume \u2013 is what makes them so thrillingly dynamic, in concert and on record. \u201cIn theory,\u201d Hoffman explains, \u201cgreensky is the complete opposite of bluegrass. So, by definition, we are contrasting everything that isn\u2019t bluegrass with everything that is.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat their sound is so seamless, so organic, is testament to Greensky\u2019s enduring vision and tireless dedication. Since their first rumblings at the start of the millennium, they have emerged as relentless road warriors, creating a captivating live show while at the same time developing a knack for evocative, disarming songcraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir fifth studio album, If Sorrows Swim \u2013 available September 9, 2014 and distributed by Thirty Tigers \u2013 is their most riveting yet, balancing gripping songs (by Hoffman and guitarist Dave Bruzza) and remarkably thoughtful, tight arrangements with an instrumental fluidity born of countless hours playing together \u2013 on stage and off. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom their unlikely base of Kalamazoo, Michigan (home of the original Gibson Mandolin-Guitar factory), Greensky \u2013 which also includes banjoist Michael Arlen Bont and bassist Michael Devol \u2013 arrived at their unique take on the bluegrass tradition by working from the outside inward. \u201cI found bluegrass through the back door,\u201d Beck says, \u201cthrough the Jerry Garcia route. That\u2019s how I got to listening to Bill Monroe and Earl Scruggs. It\u2019s really interesting how many people in our generation got into acoustic music through that channel.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nApproaching their instruments from an open-ended, rock perspective gave them the freedom to create their own rules. \u201cWe were always coming at bluegrass backwards,\u201d Hoffman says. \u201cWe were better musicians than we were bluegrass musicians. I mean, I didn\u2019t buy a mandolin until I was 18. Dave didn\u2019t start playing acoustic guitar until he was 18. Bont got a banjo when he was 20. We discovered that, when it came to learning these instruments, we preferred to do so by improvising and writing our own songs, instead playing standard material and fiddle tunes.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roots of Greensky Bluegrass lay in the friendship of Bruzza and Bont. While nurturing a nascent interest in acoustic music, they were joined by Hoffman. The trio shedded intently, playing informally in living rooms and at open mics for years before setting out as a band. Devol, a classically trained cellist, was added in the fall of 2004, and in 2006 Greensky Bluegrass won the coveted band contest at Colorado\u2019s forward-thinking Telluride Bluegrass Festival. At that point, the members dedicated themselves to Greensky full-time and began widening their touring radius.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, dobroist Beck came aboard. From the sidelines, he was quick to pinpoint the band\u2019s appeal. \u201cIt was all about the songs,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can be the best pickers in the world or the most educated musicians, but, all in all, the things that connect with people are songs, lyrics, and melodies. That was the real kicker.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy playing up to 175 shows a year, mostly in rock clubs and more open-minded festivals like Telluride, Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo, and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, Greensky Bluegrass became a word-of-mouth underground sensation, cultivating a devoted legion of fans entranced both by the band\u2019s improvisational acumen and the quality of their songwriting. Then and now, despite their wide-ranging musical interests, Greensky continues to work within the structure of a classic five-man stringband. \u201cThe cool thing about a bluegrass band or, really, any drummerless band,\u201d Hoffman explains, \u201cis that it\u2019s like acoustic chamber music \u2014 challenging, exciting, and fun to play.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhile there are potential limitations because of our instrumentation,\u201d Beck adds, \u201ca really big part of what is Greensky Bluegrass is about is to essentially ignore those limitations.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depth and sophistication of the band\u2019s interplay is showcased throughout If Sorrows Swim, across a program of stirring, resonant original songs. Recorded over ten days, the album was tracked to two-inch tape. \u201cThe decision to use tape over digital recording is basically the decision to use less,\u201d Hoffman explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not about everything being perfect, it\u2019s about capturing a moment in time.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe album mixes previously unrecorded, road-tested concert staples with new material carefully honed with the sort of razor\u2019s edge focus that the recording studio inspires.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Sorrows Swim opens with \u201cWindshield,\u201d a haunting rumination that slowly builds in emotional and musical intensity around an an insistent pulse from the bass. The desperation in Hoffman\u2019s increasingly anguished vocal is slowly surrounded by churning rhythm guitar and incessant banjo before the tension is dispersed by a plaintive dobro solo. A brooding cello line deep in the mix adds an ominous undercurrent, and underpins the group\u2019s swirling counterpoint as the track fades.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album\u2019s title derives from \u201cBurn Them,\u201d a minor key reflection set to a more straight-ahead, driving bluegrass rhythm. \u201cThere was something on This American Life,\u201d Hoffman recalls. \u201cSomeone was talking about just how upset and sad they were. They were drinking a lot, but they just couldn\u2019t drink that pain away. When I heard that, I thought to myself, \u2018What if sorrows swim?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t get that thought out of my mind.\u201d Tightly orchestrated, the performance is marked by ingenious touches. The transitions between the guitar and mandolin solos are delineated by a quick unison passage played by both instruments, and Bont contributes an especially nimble, melodic break.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving two distinct songwriting voices further enriches If Sorrows Swim, with Bruzza contributing a quartet of varied, insightful songs featuring his burnished, soulful vocals. \u201cWorried About the Weather\u201d moves between a swinging half-time feel and a breezier, bluegrass tempo \u2013 reinforcing the contrast between relief and uncertainty embodied in the lyric. Bruzza\u2019s brisk \u201cKerosene\u201d features some of the album\u2019s more daring improvisational passages, and highlights the band\u2019s gift for electrically processing their acoustic instruments to emphasize the emotion behind their playing. Hoffman\u2019s mandolin solo is colored by subtle delay, while Bruzza\u2019s spacious, inquisitive break finds him employing a slightly distorted tone to further escalate the song\u2019s intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhat makes this album different from the last,\u201d Hoffman explains, referring to 2011\u2019s accomplished Handguns, \u201cis that we paid so much more attention to what the song needs. At every juncture, we would ask, \u2018Does it serve the song?\u2019 We ask that a lot.\u201d Throughout If Sorrows Swim, Greensky\u2019s playing and arrangements are impressively intricate \u2013 and showcased in a rich, spacious sound that lets each note and accent sing and decay as if in slow motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe taxing yet rewarding process of recording now behind them, Greensky Bluegrass is anxious to unveil If Sorrows Swim\u2019s unheard material in concert. \u201cThe live experience is this springboard,\u201d Beck muses. \u201cYou just see what happens. When you\u2019re improvising every night and taking risks, it becomes a very circular thing with the audience \u2014 the audience feeds off the energy of the band and the band feeds off the energy of the audience and it becomes a much bigger thing.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the release of their first nationally distributed album and a busy touring season ahead of them, Greensky Bluegrass are facing a new level of exposure. It\u2019s a challenge they are up to, that they embrace. As their music and their audience has grown, so have they, and their sites are set ever-higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhen we were doing our first shows and making those early records,\u201d Hoffman concludes, \u201cit was stressful because we wanted to hit the right notes. We just wanted it to be good enough. But now, we want it to be great.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":662},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":207},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":138},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-og.jpg\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":690},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":69},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":345},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":449},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/77/72/95-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.greenskybluegrass.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/greenskybluegrassmusic\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/greenskybluegrass\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/campgreensky\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"campgreensky\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1764813,\"name\":\"Front Country\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.marathonmusicworks.com/event/1370543?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
