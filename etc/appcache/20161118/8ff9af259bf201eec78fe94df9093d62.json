The 14-track set collects a\\n\\ndozen standout tracks drawn from the innovative series of six 10\\\" vinyl EPs that\\n\\nCrenshaw released between 2013 and 2015, plus a pair of never-before-heard rarities\\n\\nchosen especially for this collection.\\n\\nThe EP series was the product of Crenshaw's decision to break away from the standard\\n\\nalbum/tour cycle by recording and releasing a steady stream of new music over an\\n\\nextended period. The endeavor proved wildly popular with his fans, and brought in lots of\\n\\n\\\"I really did love the EP project, and I'm kind of sad that it's over,\\\" Crenshaw comments.\\n\\n\\\"I was looking for a different way of working that would keep me motivated; it was cool,\\n\\nbecause it had a sense of urgency; there was always something that had just come out\\n\\nand always something that was on the way. It was an inspiring way to work.\\\"\\n\\n#392: The EP Collection's twelve studio recordings encompass six new Crenshaw\\n\\noriginals and six cover songs. The former group includes the bittersweet and beautiful\\n\\n\\\"Grab the Next Train,\\\" the surging and howling \\\"Move Now,\\\" and the hypnotic and\\n\\natmospheric \\\"Driving and Dreaming\\\", while the cover numbers include a reverent remake\\n\\nof the Burt Bacharach/Hal David/Carpenters chestnut \\\"Close to You,\\\" James McMurtry's\\n\\n\\\"Right Here Now,\\\" longtime Crenshaw favorite Bobby Fuller's classic \\\"Never to Be\\n\\nForgotten\\\" and vintage numbers by the Easybeats, the Move and the Lovin' Spoonful.\\n\\nRounding out #392: The EP Collection are two previously unreleased tracks: a powerful\\n\\nlive version of the Everly Brothers classic \\\"Man with Money,\\\" recorded with Crenshaw's\\n\\nfrequent touring partners the Bottle Rockets, during the week after Phil Everly's passing,\\n\\nand the infectious \\\"Front Page News,\\\" a '90s recording of a previously-unheard original\\n\\nthat Crenshaw wrote with noted country tunesmith Leroy Preston (\\\"I can't remember\\n\\nwhen I did it, or why, but I like it!\\\", says Crenshaw).\\n\\n\\\"I was fortunate to have lots of brilliant people helping me on these tracks, and they really\\n\\nlifted the proceedings,\\\" Crenshaw reports. \\\"I'm proud about the range of super-excellent\\n\\nmusicians who came on board for these sessions.\\\"\\n\\n#392: The EP Collection includes contributions from avant-jazz trumpet icon Stephen\\n\\nBernstein, noted jazz vibraphonist Bryan Carrott, versatile Nashville bassist Byron House,\\n\\nDaniel Littleton of the band Ida, renowned composer/keyboardists Rob Morsberger and\\n\\nJamie Saft, along with longstanding Crenshaw cohorts like guitarists Glen Burtnick and Andy\\n\\nYork, bassist Graham Maby, Brian Wilson/Beach Boys sideman Jeffrey Foskett, and\\n\\nacclaimed indie troubadour Dan Bern, who co-wrote four songs with Crenshaw.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on several tracks, Crenshaw worked on his own in his home studio,\\n\\noverdubbing all or most of the instruments and vocal harmonies himself. Crenshaw\\n\\nstates, \\\"I've been into the Narcissist, solitary-genius thing for a long time. For instance,\\n\\n\\\"'Cynical Girl,' on my first album, is just me, and 'Someday Someway' is my brother on\\n\\ndrums and me on everything else.

Records, which released\\n\\nhis self-titled 1982 debut album. That collection established Crenshaw as one of the era's\\n\\npreeminent rock ' n' rollers, and that was confirmed by such subsequent albums as Field\\n\\nDay, Downtown, Mary Jean & 9 Others, Good Evening, Life's Too Short, Miracle of\\n\\nScience, #447, What's in the Bag? and Jaggedland.\\n\\nAlong the way, Crenshaw's compositions have been covered by a broad array of\\n\\nperformers, including Bette Midler, Kelly Willis, Robert Gordon, Ronnie Spector, Marti\\n\\nJones and the Gin Blossoms, with whom Crenshaw co-wrote the Top 10 single \\\"Til I Hear\\n\\nIt From You.\\\" He's also provided music for several film soundtracks, appeared in the films\\n\\nLa Bamba (in which he portrayed Buddy Holly) and Peggy Sue Got Married, and was\\n\\nnominated for Grammy and a Golden Globe awards for writing the title track for the film\\n\\ncomedy Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story.

They've crushed rowdy Friday night crowds, convinced sitting audiences to get on their feet, and pulled weary festival onlookers across muddy fields to the front of the stage. With their 12th album, South Broadway Athletic Club, the quartet gives a master class in capturing the beauty of everyday life, and painting a portrait of ongoing hope.\\n\\nSouth Broadway Athletic Club is an album full of new experiences for the band. Although they again worked with longtime producer Eric \\\"Roscoe\\\" Ambel (of Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, The Del-Lords, The Yayhoos) it was the first time the group recorded a full album in their hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. Working at Sawhorse Studios, it was also the first time they scheduled sessions in batches over several months, allowing the songs - and the whole album - to fully breathe and unfold. The extended songwriting process not only allowed a gestation period for the music, but also created the opportunity for a new musical collaboration with the Nashville hit-songwriting family The Henningsens, resulting in the song \\\"Something Good.\\\" These fresh directions helped focus the band's creativity and energy throughout the recording sessions, adding further dimension to the album.\\n\\nSinger/guitarist Brian Henneman meticulously crafts lyric-chapters straight from his well-worn journal. The album's sharp-as-shit songwriting kicks off with \\\"Monday (Everytime I Turn Around),\\\" and the tough but tender \\\"Big Lotsa Love.\\\" The latter is built on engaging wordplay that takes the listener through the ups and downs of working through the world with someone you care about. In \\\"Dog,\\\" a jangly, Byrds-infused, unaffected but never cloying, tribute (with Henneman's new weapon of choice: a chimey, 12-string Rickenbacker) to a favorite canine, he sings, \\\"I love my dog, he's my dog/ If you don't love my dog, that's OK/ I don't want you to, he's my dog.\\\" The zen-like wisdom transcends merely a song about a pet and, rather, packs the message and life philosophy that, \\\"Sometimes life is just this simple.\\\"\\n\\nSonically, The Bottle Rockets still find the quickest two-lane highway into the bloodstream. There are pulses through the rhythm section of Mark Ortmann's made for FM radio, wall-of-sound drumming and bassist Keith Voegele's deep and shapely lines. They are Missouri's answer to Muscle Shoals' The Swampers \u2013 Swiss Army knife players, distinctive and in the pocket. It's honed further with John Horton's classic rock guitar snarl on \\\"I Don't Wanna Know,\\\" a song that could otherwise be a Tom Jones classic about a relationship lie. On the speaker-rattling \\\"Building Chryslers,\\\" Horton and Henneman ignite a crunchy guitar duel that'd fit nicely on the LP shelf between Dinosaur Jr and Thin Lizzy. The song is a compelling character study told only as The Bottle Rockets can.\\n\\nShimmering, fresh coats of paint are applied in \\\"Ship It On the Frisco,\\\" a Southern soul-influenced song about childhood train hopping, and \\\"XOYOU,\\\" which showcases the band's cosmopolitan touches through a Rockpile/Nick Lowe-inflected pop gem mixing in shuffling drums, handclaps and harmonies. Elsewhere, \\\"Big Fat Nuthin'\\\" is an earwormworthy \\\"ode\\\" to exhaustion with a Black Flag \\\"TV Party\\\" vibe.\\n\\nThroughout their entire career, The Bottle Rockets have managed to stay true to the rabid music heads as well as casual dial-turning everybodies. After 20+ years, they've come out on the other side stronger and more energized than ever before, proactively writing their own creative arc. Against the odds, the Bottle Rockets are a true American success story. Consequently, South Broadway Athletic Club is an album as relevant as their formative early work; political by not being political, re-affirming our greatest aspirations by focusing on the tiniest of truths.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":492},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":492},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":154},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":154},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":103},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":103},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":525},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":51},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":51},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":256},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":256},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/27/39-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":333}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bottlerocketsmusic.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/bottlerockets\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bottlerockets\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bottlerockets\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.theliveoak.com/event/1386070?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
