I was obsessed with The Beatles, Hendrix, Sinatra, and Sam Cooke. The Blues were my foundation. I hung with a crowd of young musicians who shared my love of the classics. We listened to vinyl. We played in bands. \\r\\n \\r\\nMy safe, little vintage\u00adrock world was turned on its head when underground hip\u00adhop came knocking at my door. Rappers wanted me to sing hooks on their songs. I never in a million years thought what I did made sense in hip\u00adhop. Eminem and Outkast had blown my mind as a kid, but it was still an alien world to me. \\r\\n \\r\\nAs uncomfortable as it was, I jumped in. At first, my bluesy singing made the hooks come across as a sort of \u201cblue-eyed soul\u201d thing. I didn\u2019t identify with that. The hooks I loved most had been sampled from old records. They contrasted the beat in a cool way. They felt distorted and fuzzy and their juxtaposition with modern music had an accidental magic. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe experiment was to see if I could convince people that my hook was a sample. I sang more laid back, more like a crooner than a hard\u00adattacking soul singer. I distorted my voice with guitar amps and heavy reverbs that created a huge space. \\r\\nThe summer I turned 19 I made this slow beat and wrote a hook over it called \u201cNice and Slow.\u201d I used my sampled vocal approach and started sending the song around and playing it for people. The response was always, \u201cWhoa! Where did you sample this from?\u201d At that moment, my sound was born. \\r\\n \\r\\nBy the spring, my songs were gaining some attention. \u201cNice and Slow\u201d and \u201cWhite Lies\u201d charted on Hype Machine and a few months later I signed with Atlantic Records. A major-label deal marked a serious second chapter in my creative life. Songs were no longer practice swings. They counted. There were real stakes now. But with a new opportunity in front of me, I dove in head first. \\r\\n \\r\\nI now had access to collaborators and studios that enabled me to indulge in new sounds. Though I remained a producer on all the tracks and played 90 percent of the instruments, the songs were elevated thanks to the input of the brilliant writers and producers I met \u2014 guys like Benny Blanco, Nick Ruth, and Franc Tetaz. What began as an experiment in a basement lab blossomed into a larger-scale process, resulting in the songs on my new EP, Intoxication.\\r\\n \\r\\nSonically, I was inspired by artists like Amy Winehouse and Raphael Saadiq, who breathed fresh life into the classic \u201960s soul sound. Their vintage songs have a modern edge to the production. My process is the reverse. I try to write songs that, if played on an acoustic guitar, are very modern. But my execution of the singing, instrumentation, and production is vintage.\\r\\n \\r\\nLyrically, the songs on Intoxication personify love, money, and death as a drug, reflecting the way my submission to imagination has consumed me like a chemical. \\r\\n \\r\\nMy experiment became an abstract mind state that I want the listener to visit.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-og.jpg\",\"width\":1365,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/63/44-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"https://soundcloud.com/maxfrostmusic\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://maxfrost.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/maxfrostmusic/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1763707,\"name\":\"The Young Wild\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"All things considered, The Young Wild should not exist. \\r\\nWhich is to say, film majors and chemistry majors rarely jam together. \\r\\nOdds are slimmer they\u2019ll commit their entire careers to the noises produced. \\r\\nAnd if a drummer catches said film major stealing his cymbals after jazz ensemble, he\u2019d sooner tell him off than join his band\u2014right? \\r\\n\\r\\nWrong\u2014these are the kinds of events that brought The Young Wild together. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat if singer/guitarist Bryan B. Williams pursued a career in film? What if bassist Gareth Moore committed full-time to a lab coat and test tubes? Perhaps drummer Brandon Taylor Zedaker lost himself in the bottomless expanse that is jazz and never climbed out? \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is to say, listening to The Young Wild is catching a reaction mid-combustion. \\r\\n\\r\\nTangential threads from San Diego, Temecula and Hawaii sewn into circumstance and the pursuit of a similar sound: modern alt-rock played on vintage tubes and synths excavated from the depths of eBay. The music is reminiscent, yet never derivative, of influences like Tame Impala, Father John Misty, The Killers, Delta Spirit and Cold War Kids to name a few. A combination of classic rock chops earned from years in cover bands, and the cool chime of alt-rock (a la Devo and Alphaville) cut with William\u2019s allegiance to soul, Motown and precision groove. New wave with an old soul. All of the angst ridden youth, all of the hindsight. \\r\\n\\r\\nYet, for all their chemistry, The Young Wild is not a precious product of instagram and a sell-your-soul pursuit of labeldom. The fact is, the songs came faster than they knew what to do with them\u2014the attention followed. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter releasing the single \u201cNot A One\u201d online, the band received looks and listens from blogs and label heads, including Fairfax Recordings\u2019 Kevin Augunas, who reached out to share his excitement about the track. As it happened, The Young Wild was on a tour that brought them to Los Angeles the very next day. They played a show that Fairfax reps attended, and spent the following day touring the studio, shaking hands and making an impression that led to an offer to sign just a few days later. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s a landscape that these songs stand on,\u201d says William about the material for the band\u2019s upcoming album. \u201cLike, downtown Los Angeles on a Thursday at two AM is a very specific landscape.
