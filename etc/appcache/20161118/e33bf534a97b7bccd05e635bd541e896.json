With their 3rd album 'Never Wanna Die' released on August 14th, 2015, the band continues to modernize their heavy rock n' roll sound. With multiple Juno award-winner Eric Ratz (Monster Truck, Billy Talent) in the producer chair, it's only fitting the album was nominated for 'Heavy Metal Album of the Year' at the 2016 Juno Awards. Remaining true to their sound, Diemonds takes lyrics that speak to the outcasts, wild childs, and misfits, and combines them with a hard-hitting live show, taking cues from the greats they look up to. \\nPriya Panda , the band's front woman, is the sultry singer that the music world has never been so poised for. Every time she steps on stage she walks the indeterminable fine line between class and crass. With her larger-than-life presence, she breaks every cultural, social, gender and sexual boundary known to hard rock. If the ever growing legions of the band's loyal following, known as \\\"Die-Hards\\\", are any indication, Priya and the rest of her bandmates are firmly carving their own path in music and hoards of rock fans are already along for the ride.\\nDiemonds' previous full-length effort, \\\"The Bad Pack\\\", was released October 2012 and has taken them on countless North American tours in support of it. Diemonds are known for their relentless touring schedule and their \\\"leave everything on the stage\\\" live show attitude. Notable tour stops at festivals include Heavy MTL, SXSW, NXNE, Vans Warped Tour, Rocklahoma, Seattle Hempfest and most recently The KISS Kruise w/ KISS & Cheap Trick. Additionally, there has been no shortage of support slots for legends like Slash, Steel Panther, Sebastian Bach, & many more!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":386,\"height\":500},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":386,\"height\":500},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":389},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":259},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-og.jpg\",\"width\":386,\"height\":500},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":130},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":386,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":386,\"height\":500},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/06/72/97-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://diemonds.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Diemonds\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Diemonds\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Diemonds\"},{\"id\":1741845,\"name\":\"Pigeon Park\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"After years of hard work, sacrifice, dedication and battling the usual rigours of writing, recording and touring, Vancouver rockers Pigeon Park are seeing their star on the rise in a big way. \\n\\nAs a respected band on the Vancouver live music scene, known for their ballsy, authentic, high-octane brand of non-formulaic rock, the band earned both popular and critical acclaim following the release of their sophomore EP Black Widow. Critics and fans alike saw the band grow with new songs that were unmistakably theirs; memorable songs that rocked the house. \\n\\nFrom the likes of video track \\\"Come Down Slow,\\\" with its driving beat and portrayal of a homeless girl's life, to the album's title track with its unforgettable melody and \\\"Feel The Rain,\\\" an exploration of the darkness and negative emotions that overtake us at the demise of an intense relationship, Black Widow certainly does slice. Yet thanks to its compelling and insightful essence coupled with driving, pointed and raw musicianship, it's a delightful incision.\\n\\nFormed as long-time friends who grew increasingly inspired by one another's musicianship, Pigeon Park's legacy extends far beyond their 2008 inception. Initially dallying with blues-based jams influenced by the likes of Led Zeppelin, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Funkadelic and The Raconteurs, an immediate common ground solidified the Pigeon Park sound.\\n\\n\\\"We were all friends jamming since childhood,\\\" reflects Weber. \\\"We all went to school together, discovered bands together and jammed together. Eventually, we just bridged that gap.\\\"\\n\\nThe formation of Pigeon Park was more than merely spanning a divide, however. The release of their debut album The Sun and two cross-Canada tours served to amplify creativity and burgeoning support for the band. Still, Pigeon Park outshine their previous effort with the consolidated attack and no-frills direction of Black Widow.\\n\\nNot long after the release of the EP, Pigeon Park won the highly competitive 99.3 CFOX \\\"Seeds\\\" competition. Previous winners of the acclaimed radio station contest have included Nickelback, Matthew Good, Bif Naked, Default and Theory of a Deadman. As the Platinum Award winners, the band will be touring with Sam Roberts in 2014 and have received $10,000 in tour support and $10,000 in gear. \\nBut the cherry on top of their rock and roll sundae, was earning the opportunity to record their next album with legendary producer/engineer Garth Richardson (Rage Against The Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers).\\n\\n\\\"His name is pretty intimidating,\\\" says Nick Weber, the band's vocalist and co-founder. \\\"We are walking into that studio more prepared than we have ever been. We aren't about to waste his time or ours. Under his guidance we know we will be creating the best product we can\\\". \\n\\nStill in their early 20s, Pigeon Park have been very lucky in the rock 'n roll game so far. They have won one of the most prestigious radio contests in the country, toured a across the country in support of their two EP's, have released an official single to commercial rock radio, performed on numerous TV shows across three provinces, and have built and maintained a steadily growing fan base. \\n\\n\\\"This is what we've been working for since the beginning of Pigeon Park,\\\" says Okabe. \\\"We're more focused and hungry than ever before.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://pigeonparkmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pigeonpark\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/pigeonpark\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"pigeonpark\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1500211,\"name\":\"With Special Guests\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1765871,\"name\":\"Bloody Diamonds\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1591737,\"name\":\"Bathurst Station\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bathurststation.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/bathurststation\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bathurststation\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bathurststation\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1347633?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
