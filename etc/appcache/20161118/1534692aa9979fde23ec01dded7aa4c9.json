Taking cues from the music he was raised on Erick is blending soulful melodic lyrics, with the deep groove of roots-rock and as his lyric says, \\\"with some of the harder stuff.\\\" Showcasing a smooth voice with an excellent upper register, uniquely gravely at times, and always pleasant to the ear, Erick is bringing lots of soul to the mix, along with undeniably Texas inspired lyrics. \ufeff\\r\\nGetting his start at an early age, Erick has been no stranger to performing. Growing up in Henrietta, Erick spent countless sundays in church with his grandmother learning to love the craft of singing through the choir and holiday cantana specials Erick found his passion for music. Whether it was singing in the choir, traveling to perform in the Texasville Opry, Johhn High's Country Music show, the Texas Gold Country Music Show, or simply talent shows, Erick never lost that drive. One might say Erick was born to perform and entertain and they would be right.\\r\\nAlways one to recognize where he came from, Erick Credits his mother for much of his success. Being a single parent, Erick recognized the hard work and dedication his mother put into raising he and his sisters, and took away a strong work ethic and applied it to his craft. Erick's mother also helped inffluence his musical tastes though her immense love of great hard-rock goups as AC/DC, Whitesnake and Journey. Not only was the rock there, but Erick's grandfather, also a huge influence in his upbringing, introduced him to the golden age of country music.\\r\\nThrough a sold mix of musical styles, and a great supporting cast of family and friends, Erick began to form a genuinely unique ear for music and a solid grasp on life and how to live. As a freshman in high school, Erick took up guitar class and began to learn how to create his own blend of music. It really didn't take long for Erick to realize he had found his calling, and so began his journey as an independent artist. From open mic nights, to talent shows, to late night recordings at a friends home studio, Erick quickly found himself as a performer and not just a guy who could pick out a few cords.\\r\\nAfter earning his first spin via Justin Frazell on KFWR 95.9 the Ranch, things began to move even more quickly than he could have imagined. Starting to book more shows and doing a few interviews, Erick know the timing was right to head into the studio. Choosing to go to the prestigious Fort Worth Sound, and work with Bart Rose proved to be a solid success. In the Summer of 2012, Erick released his first album, and EP simply, and directly titled EP SUMMER 12 to critical acclaim. Brandon Myers (music writer with txrdr.com and Red Dirt Blue Collar) said: \\\"Erick Willis is an incredibly talented artist with relatable lyrics and a natural, genuine voice. He is undoubtedly a next level toubador.\\\" And the praise didnt stop there, \\\"Erick Willis will be a star. Already a lone star, he has the gift to become a national star.\\\" were Justin Frazell's (nationally syndicated host of Texas Red Dirt Roads show) thoughts. Shayne Hollinger (Host of The Side Show on KFWR 95.9 The Ranch) said: \\\"Erick is a fantastic souldful singer-songwriter. This scene needs an artist like Erick. It's time to wake up and pay attention folks.\\\"\\r\\nNever one to let praise or success go to his head, Erick understands where his strengths lie, and knows where he belongs. \\\"I think I've found my home in this Texas scene.\\\" said Erick. Standing firmyly on the convictions of making the most of life, and never forgetting where he comes from, Erick is poised to find success at a great level in this business.  Though a unique approach to performing and writing, Erick will continue to be apprectiated for many years to come, and be no stranger to the joy that can be found when a melody through six strings meets the power of emotion in true lyrics.\\r\\nPassion and depth are what makes any good songwriter transition to the next level. Connecting with the audienceis the ultimate key. Erick does that. The raw, heartfelt emotion in his delivery can convince even the harshest of critics.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/31/61-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.erickwillismusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/ErickWillis\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Erick_Willis\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Erick_Willis\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://sundownatgranada.ticketfly.com/event/1365465?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
