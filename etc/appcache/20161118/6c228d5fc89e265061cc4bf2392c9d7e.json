Emerging in 1966, Canned Heat was founded by blues historians and record collectors Alan \\\"Blind Owl\\\" Wilson and Bob \\\"The Bear\\\" Hite. Hite took the name \\\"Canned Heat\\\" from a 1928 recording by Tommy Johnson. They were joined by Henry \\\"The Sunflower\\\" Vestine, another ardent record collector who was a former member of Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. Rounding out the band in 1967 were Larry \\\"The Mole\\\" Taylor on bass, an experienced session musician who had played with Jerry Lee Lewis and The Monkees and Adolfo \\\"Fito\\\" de la Parra on drums who had played in two of the biggest Latin American bands, Los Sinners and Los Hooligans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band attained three worldwide hits, \\\"On The Road Again\\\" in 1968, \\\"Let's Work Together\\\" in 1970 and \\\"Going Up The Country\\\" in 1969 became rock anthems throughout the world with the later being adopted as the unofficial theme song for the film Woodstock and the \\\"Woodstock Generation.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey secured their niche in the pages of rock 'n roll history with their performances at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival (along with Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and The Who) and the headlining slot at the original Woodstock Festival in 1969. The band can boast of collaborations with John Mayall and Little Richard and later with blues icon, John Lee Hooker, the musician that they initially got much of their musical inspiration from in the first place. This union produced the spirited and revered album, \\\"Hooker 'n Heat.\\\" The band is also credited with bringing a number of other forgotten bluesmen to the forefront of modern blues including Sunnyland Slim, who they found driving a taxi in Chicago, Skip James, who they found in a hospital in Tunica, Mississippi and took to the Newport Festival, Memphis Slim and Clarence \\\"Gatemouth\\\" Brown with whom theyrecorded in France and Albert Collins.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 3rd, 1970, the band was shattered by the suicide of Alan Wilson. His death sparked reconstruction within the group and member changes have continued throughout the past three decades. On April 5th, 1981, at the Palamino in Los Angeles, gargantuan vocalist,Bob Hite, collapsed and died of a heart attack and on October 20th, 1997, Henry Vestine died in Paris, France following the final gig of a European tour. In 2008, singer/harmonica frontman Robert Lucas passed away from a drug overdose.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite these untimely deaths and assorted musical trends, Canned Heat has survived. They have performed at world-renowned venues such as Paris' Olympia, both Fillmore Auditoriums, The Kaleidoscope, Carnegie Hall (with John Lee Hooker), Madison Square Garden and even Royal Albert Hall and have played more biker festivals and charity events than any other band in the world. They and/or their music have been featured on television (In Concert, David Frost, MervGriffin, Midnight Special, Playboy After Dark, etc.), and in films (\\\"Woodstock,\\\" \\\"Flashback,\\\" and \\\"Forrest Gump\\\") etc. Their legend has recently been heard and felt in various television commercials (\\\"On The Road Again\\\" for Miller Beer, \\\"Goin' Up The Country\\\" for Pepsi, Chevrolet and McDonalds, \\\"Let's Work Together\\\" for Lloyd's Bank, England's Electric Company and for Target Stores along with other songs for 7-Up, Levi's and Heineken Beer).\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, more than forty-five years later and with thirty-eight albums to their credit, Canned Heat is still going strong. They have been anchored throughout the past forty years by the steady hand of drummer/band leader Adolfo \\\"Fito\\\" de la Parra. Joining \\\"Fito\\\" is original bassist Larry \\\"The Mole\\\" Taylor and New Orleans legend, Dale Spalding on harmonica, guitar and lead vocals. Chicago great Harvey Mandel is the regular guitarist but has been temporarily replaced by John \\\"JP\\\" Paulus while \\\"The Snake\\\" deals with serious health issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nFito's book, \\\"LIVING THE BLUES\\\" tells the complete and outrageous Canned Heat story of \\\"Music, Drugs, Death, Sex and Survival\\\" along with over 100 captivating pictures from their past and is available through the band's website at www.cannedheatmusic.com and at most popular book outlets\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":169},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":169},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":113},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":113},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-og.jpg\",\"width\":1920,\"height\":1080},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":56},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":56},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":281},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":281},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":366},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/26/41-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":366}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.cannedheatmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1755107,\"name\":\"Gene Evaro Jr\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Kicking Off Summer With A National Tour Gene Evaro Jr is currently performing their deeply-grooved funky blues, and soulful folk from CA to NY as supporting act for RCA artist Elle King. King's debut album \\\"Love Stuff\\\" is receiving rave reviews. Many venues were SOLD OUT before the tour even started, including The Bowery Ballroom in NY, NY, Lamberts in Austin, TX, and Troubadour in Hollywood, CA.\\n\\nGene Evaro Jr's formidable and dedicated following is rapidly expanding beyond So-Cal, fueled by recent touring and appearances at The Joshua Tree Music Festival, AMFM Festival, and the 111 Music Festival. The band was honored with an invitation to play on the main stage at the NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA, via the John Lennon Songwriting Contest and the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus, after returning from their 2014 Fall West Coast Tour, to Seattle, WA.\\n\\nFrontman Gene Evaro Jr's works have also been featured on the network television show Deadliest Catch and Ian Somerhalder's Time Framed Series.\\n\\nGene Evaro Jr is currently promoting their album Soul (How I keep Movin' On) and are working on their next full length album, \\\"Too Good To Believe\\\" in-between touring.\\n\\nHailing from magical Joshua Tree, California, since 2008, a place in which many music groups from all over the world come, and have for years, in search of the quiet spirit that is the high desert, Gene Evaro Jr embody that spirit with pure inspiration and creativity, like that of some greats, some of whom we've lost and miss dearly.\\n\\nFrom the folk magic of Paul Simon, to the crazy funk fashion of Sly & The Family Stone, to the lyrical poetry of Jim Morrison, this old-soul youthful group of artists reminds us of what it once felt like to put on a record, press play, and then relish in every word from start to finish, without missing one beat. Gene's songs speak for his generation through his prolific songwriting. Musically reminiscent of Allen Stone, Blake Mills and Xavier Rudd, Gene Jr. brings the avant-garde stylings of Albert King to mind including playing a mean upside-down guitar, music that not only moves listeners with a force that manifests in dancing feet, it is music that heals your entire being to the core.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneJrAndTheFamily/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.sohosb.com/event/1366127?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
