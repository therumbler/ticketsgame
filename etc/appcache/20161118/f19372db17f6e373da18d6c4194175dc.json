McCollum\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"PARKER MCCOLLUM: In The Truest Sense\\r\\n\\r\\nHonesty in music is as important to Parker McCollum as breathing. He rejects the music of mainstream, not for its fabricated artists or over-produced sound but, for its lack of creativity and genuine stories of truth and passion. As a musician and performer, he looks up to the art of pioneers such as Ryan Bingham, Ryan Adams and Townes Van Zant, artists who have lived their songs and have the battle scars to prove it. A mix of Americana, Texas Country and Indie Rock is the genesis of McCollum\u2019s music career and he channels his creativity into delivering a genuine sound all his own. Kicking things off with his first single, \\\"Highway\\\" is a driving introduction to this spirited artist who aims to inspire and entertain in a way only one who declares he has no story of his own to tell can, by making one up with words and music.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nA song about living on the road, \u201cHighway\u201d was inspired when McCollum went on a tour for the first time with Six Market Blvd. Being on the road and playing shows was something he had dreamed of since he was a kid; when he finally got out there and saw what it was all about, he jotted it all down for easy reference. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhen I got home, I just wrote all about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI sat in my room for about an hour and that\u2019s what came of it. It\u2019s all true: the Louisiana woman, my momma and my baby being so far away that I didn't even bother trying to go home. I was just out there, on my own, living and playing, at last, on the highway.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the highway beckoned, McCollum lived the life of a college kid in Austin. He was raised in Houston during the heyday of country music listening to greats like Willie Nelson, George Strait and Johnny Cash while his family introduced him to Texas artists like Cross Canadian Ragweed, Pat Green and Cory Morrow. Working with his grandfather on a ranch, he was exposed to legendary songwriters like Bob Dylan, Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, and even Porter Wagoner and Buck Owens. Music was a staple and his own experiences began when he learned the violin and played in the orchestra during his years in elementary school. He picked up the guitar at 13 and began playing open mic nights at Puffabelly\u2019s Old Depot in Spring and even scored a few other shows \u201chere and there\u201d finally managing to get a gig in Giddings when he was a sophomore. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI got to drive there by myself and everything,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI was 16 yet looked like I was about 10 or 11. But, I played, and I think I turned a couple of heads. It was just enough to want to do it again. From then on I've just been picking and writing and singing, hoping someday it would take me somewhere that school never could; otherwise known as a dream.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a penchant for writing poetic lyrics, McCollum follows the masters: Hayes Carll, Todd Snider, Ryan Bingham and other talented songwriters who saw major success. As he grew older and began to grow with music, it was guys like Adam Carrol, Joe Ely, and Chris Knight that he was drawn to. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cAll these artists crank out beautiful songs one after another. During my last two years of high school and my first year of college, I went through phases where I would learn their songs and start to sound like them and dress like them.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn't until he bought John Mayer\u2019s CONTINUUM on vinyl, that McCollum felt the urge to be different. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cMayer was so different and honest from such a young age that I just kind of took that and ran with it. He taught me to let my writing be free, and let the melodies and lyrics create themselves. His knowledge and ability are something that I will always envy.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the work of Ryan Bingham just as closely, McCollum acknowledges it is the emotion that a songwriter portrays that makes the art so honest and real. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cYou can hear the heartache and past troubles in every word of his songs. That is what catches me and inspires me to be so genuine,\u201d he admits. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs McCollum goes in to the studio to complete his first full recording, fans are getting a sneak peek with the EP, A RED TOWN VIEW which was produced by Corby Schaub, long-time guitarist with Ryan Bingham. Inclined to create music reminiscent of a bygone era, McCollum says he feels a more rock vibe but that country music roots are the driving force of his music. \\r\\n\u201cI find myself loving blues, soul and folk rock these days,\u201d he says. \u201cI have always loved them, I was just so heavily influenced in country music that it took a while for me to break away and really follow my ears and my heart. It\u2019s not about a genre, it\u2019s just who I am, I guess.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with most great songwriters, the question of how they write their material is at the forefront. For McCollum, it all goes back to the beginning: his older brother, Tyler, drilled into him that \u201call you have to do is write a great song.\u201d Hoping to follow in his footsteps, McCollum admired the ability Tyler showed in stringing lines together with witty, clever and intelligent lyrics that put the listener in a special place where everything made perfect sense. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cTyler had this really cool blank leather book, like a diary that he used for songwriting,\u201d McCollum tells. \u201cHe wouldn't let me open it because it was all of his thoughts, writings and personal stuff. He headed back to college one afternoon, and I noticed that he had left his little book. I wanted to look inside and read some of it. I opened the first page and it said, \u2018Write on. Love, Tyler.\u2019 It was brand new and he had bought it for me to write in. I didn't waste a second; I walked right into the living room and wrote one of the worst songs ever written, but it was a song and it was mine. Ever since then, I've been hooked, always searching for \u2018that song.\u2019 And, yes, I still write in that same book to this day.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCollum doesn't have a formula for writing and says each song is written in a different manner. He admits to driving down the road and thinking of a line, or hearing a song that sparks a melody. He also reveals that, \u201cit\u2019s never the same, it never repeats itself. It\u2019s always changing and it\u2019s such a compelling thing to do all of the time I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so addicting. It\u2019s wild and it\u2019s what I love to do. Every single song I write is just the moments of my life finally coming out in words. If you ever want to know what I\u2019ve been going through, just listen to my latest songs.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith every stroke of pen to paper, McCollum aims to maintain his artistic integrity, writing about real experiences and emotions, all the while staying true to his oath of authenticity and desire to make music that rings true. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cEvery single bit of my music begins from honesty; my lyrics are my honest thoughts and feelings about the world and how I'm getting through it. Honesty is my foundation and it\u2019s all I have. I didn't have some crazy childhood like Bingham, I didn't go to Berkley like Mayer. I haven\u2019t overcome any adversity and don\u2019t have a story about how music saved my soul. I am just a kid who loves music and really respects what a true artist stands for.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCollum\u2019s debut album is due in the fall and he is playing shows to build his fan base with performances alongside artists such as Six Market Blvd., William Clark Green, Bri Bagwell, Zack Walther and Grady Skelton. To date he has played Firehouse Saloon (Houston), City Limits (Stephenville), Saxon Pub (Austin), and in his hometown of Conroe at Red Brick Tavern to a record-breaking crowd. He has also appeared on The Shiner Sessions w/ Katy Lee and the Suzy Q radio programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he works towards success and finding ways to achieve his dream of being on that \u201chighway\u201d full-time, McCollum continues to write his stories, gathering inspiration from his everyday life and from those around him. With an authenticity that is hard to come by in young adults these days, he is humble and passionate, two factors that will hopefully show through as he makes his way in today\u2019s music scene.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI know there is no right way to pursue music these days so I do it honestly and in a way that honors those that paved the way before me,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI just so happen to love it, and I don\u2019t want to do anything else. I want to carry on and, hopefully, leave my little brand on it one day.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwww.ParkerMcCollum.com\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Request More Information, Artist Materials or Interviews/Special Appearances, please contact:\\r\\nAmi Blackwell | SpinDrift Media & Entertainment | Ph: 281-832-6696 | Em: ami@spindriftme.com\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Make Requests to Management or for Venue Booking Inquiries, please contact:\\r\\nCheri Blankenship | Hendrix Music Agency |Ph: 281-995-3179 | cheri@hendrixmusicagency.com\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-og.jpg\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":667},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/21/89-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.parkermccollum.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/parkermccollummusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/parkermccollum\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"parkermccollum\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1382707,\"name\":\"Will Carter Band\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"So much country music today chases images of imaginary love stories leading to fairytale and film worthy lyrics. Country nights in a pickup truck down the back roads of your hometown tell the real tales of growing up for the Texas native and southern bred Will Carter. Growing up in a small town with a deep passion for music, Will Carter has been chasing his own dream down many roads for a long time. His father was his biggest supporter from the very beginning. After losing his father at the very early age of 13, Will Carter developed an unstoppable motivational drive to continue to pursue his dreams. He's telling his story with a voice that\u2019s turning complete strangers into life-long listeners. \\r\\n\\r\\nWill Carter was hired at the age of 18 as a lead vocalist for the legendary dancehall band from Texas, The Emotions. During his tenure with the Emotions he played festivals and dancehalls all over Texas. \u201cIt was a sincere honor to be a part of the vastly popular band that I grew up idolizing. I learned a great deal of how to put on a high energy show and capture and hold the attention of audiences of all sizes\u201d says Carter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter graduating from Texas A&M University, Will Carter decided to pursue original music. He has since had charting singles on both Texas and Nashville radio. Will Carter has a very high energy live show that combines rock star stage presence with catchy, groovy tunes. Will Carter has brought his show to dancehalls and festivals all over the south region of the US as well as major events such as CMA Fest in Nashville, the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo, National Football League, Houston Texans, and the JJ Watt Foundation.\u202f\\r\\n\\r\\nWill continues to keep his voice healthy by taking lessons with renown vocal instructor, Tom McKinney. With more than 40 years as performer and voice teacher, Tom McKinney has trained many award winning singers including Mario, Demi Lovato, Ray J, Solange, and American Idol finalists. Tom also served as the New Talent Development Vocal Technique Instructor for Beyonce and Mathew Knowles\u2019 recording and publishing company, Music World, in Houston.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing up on a self-sustaining farm in the rural town of Frydek, Texas, Will Carter learned the value of hard work and dedication at a very early age. \\\"I've always been the wild one, and came up in a fast paced 24/7 work hard, play hard environment,\\\" Carter says. \\\"For me, it's always been about working hard, making music and hanging with my people. This is what you\u2019ll hear about when you listen to my album.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this attitude comes the conversational style found on Will Carter\u2019s album.
