Hello, Christmas!\\r\\n\\r\\nBecky Shaw & Allen Broyles \\r\\n\\r\\nBecky Shaw (Roxie Watson, Susi French Connection, Reversing Hour) and Allen Broyles (Josh Joplin Group, Susi French Connection, The Crafties) met in 1994, during the production of the studio recording, \u201cJesus Christ, Superstar: A Resurrection\u201d featuring Amy Ray (Jesus) and Emily Saliers (Mary Magdalene), along with many Atlanta bands and musicians. During rehearsals & performances of the live production of JCS at the Variety Playhouse, SXSW and \u201cThe Pier\u201d in Seattle, both came to respect each other\u2019s musical talents.  But it was their experience working together in cover bands \u201cThe Cake Toppers\u201d and \u201cSusi French Connection\u201d that gave Becky the idea to enlist Allen\u2019s help in recording some Christmas songs with her in 2008.  What began as an idea to create some simple recordings of a few Christmas carols to give as gifts that year quickly evolved into something that sounded so great, they decided to do a second recording the following year and have begun work on a third.  \u201cIt\u2019s been an epic project!\u201d  \\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2009, Becky and Allen have continued to work together in various music projects, most recently Becky\u2019s first solo record, \u201cShut Down, Jump In,\u201d released in January of this year, which Allen co-produced with Becky & Rob Gal.  But around the winter holidays, if the spirit moves them to dust off the holiday songs, you\u2019re in for a special, fun evening of music.

She's currently the banjo player and one of the singers and songwriters in Atlanta Americana band, Roxie Watson, but you'll often find her sitting in with friends on an assortment of instruments. During the 2000's, she led the Atlanta rock bands Herman Put Down the Gun and STB. She also toured nationally as the bass player for Cowboy Mouth and the guitar and mandolin player for Paul Sanchez and the Rolling Road Show. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile performing with different bands and artists, Sonia has continued to hone her craft as a songwriter and solo artist. Her latest record, A Place for Everyone (released in November 2014) was recorded half in New Orleans and half it Atlanta, and features guest appearances from both cities, including the Indigo Girls' Amy Ray, Bonerama's Craig Klein, Hannah Thomas, and Jamie Lynn Vessels. The 13 songs on the album showcase Sonia's own special blend of rock 'n roll and Americana with a New Orleans flair.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther artists have begun to take notice of her songwriting as well. Sonia's songs have been performed and recorded by artists such as Bonerama, Glen David Andrews, Paul Sanchez, Cowboy Mouth, Jamie Vessels, and Ars\u00e9ne DeLay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I love hearing other singers and bands bring my songs to life.
