She's a poet, storyteller, snake-charmer, good neighbor, friend and lover, minister of the wide-eyed gospel of hope and grace. All this, and she comes with a voice that declares, 'Sit down here a minute and listen.' Who could ask for more?\\\"\\r\\n\u2014 Barbara Kingsolver (Author, The Poisonwood Bible)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Carrie Newcomer - a great gift to humanity. Her music - a great gift to our souls.\\\"\\r\\n\u2014 Jill Bolte Taylor (Author, My Stroke of Insight)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I love Carrie Newcomer. She writes and sings about what is most personal to her and in doing so she speaks to the wider world. Her song 'Geodes' will make you catch your breath with its wisdom and beauty.\\\"\\r\\n\u2014 Mary Chapin Carpenter\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie Newcomer's music has always explored the intersection of the spiritual and the daily, the sacred and the ordinary. Over the course of her career she has become a prominent voice for progressive spirituality, social justice and interfaith dialogue. Her ability for sharp observation of the world lead the Dallas Morning News to rave, \\\"She's the kind of artist whose music makes you stop, think and then say, 'that is so true.'\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe has been described as \\\"a soaring songstress\\\" by Billboard, a \\\"prairie mystic\\\" by the Boston Globe, and Rolling Stone has declared that Newcomer \\\"asks all the right questions.\\\" Author Barbara Kingsolver wrote, \\\"She's a poet, storyteller, snake-charmer, good neighbor, friend and lover, minister of the wide-eyed gospel of hope and grace.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Rounder Records released a new compilation of Carrie Newcomer music entitled Kindred Spirits: A Collection. This collection draws from Newcomer's catalogue of 12 Rounder Records releases. It also includes two previously unreleased songs, two songs from her special hunger benefit project (Everything Is Everywhere), as well as two currently unavailable live recordings. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I am one of a growing number of people who don't want to put the sacred in such a small container,\\\" says Newcomer. \\\"I am disturbed that one very narrowly focused and extremely political brand of Christianity being called the 'religious voice.' There are wide communities of spiritual people who believe that walking this world in love and compassion is about feeding the hungry, providing for the poor or sick, caring for our elders, making sure that the table of love includes and welcomes everyone, educating our children and young people, honoring our beautiful and interconnected planet. These communities believe that women are equal spiritual beings, and that the highest and most honorable work is creating a less violent, more just and kind world. Isn't a life of compassion bigger than a catch phrase or sound byte? Isn't love wider and deeper than fear?\\\" Speaking more to this point, she shares, \\\"If a spiritual leader is teaching hate, it is not spiritual message, it is political message.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the topic of sacramental living Newcomer says, \\\"We don't live days, we live moments. In an ever-accelerating world that does not encourage reflection, presence has become a personal choice and decision. We will have to decide if our response to a limited amount of time is to speed up and never really be present, or to slow down to the speed of soul and savor what is momentary and now.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Part of my work as a writer is to put into language and music moments of wonder that have no words.\\\" The result is her latest release, Kindred Spirits: A Collection \u2014 a resonant soundtrack for a world that is both sacred and ordinary, reflective and forward thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior albums include the critically acclaimed Before and After, The Geography of Light, Regulars & Refugees, The Age of Possibility, The Gathering of Spirits and The Betty's Diner Collection. She has toured extensively throughout U.S. and Europe, and she has also toured with Alison Krauss. In 2003, Nickel Creek recorded Newcomer's song, I Should've Known Better, on their Grammy-winning album This Side. She was listed as one of \\\"the 50 most influential folk musicians of the past 50 years\\\" by Chicago's WFMT. In 2010, Carrie Newcomer was honored by the Indiana State Senate and House along with the cast of Wilderness Plots for special achievement in the arts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 2009 and again in 2011, Carrie was invited to tour India as a cultural ambassador for the American Embassy. As a result of her time there, in 2011 she released her fifteenth album; Everything is Everywhere, a collaboration with master of the Indian classical sarod, Amjad Ali Khan. A beautifully created fusion of east and west, the songs were written to address what is unique and fascinating about our cultural differences and yet reach into the common human thread that pulls between us. \\\"In a time when we are encouraged to fear difference or diversity, Everything Is Everywhere was created as an alternative to fear and an affirmation of creative and compassionate engagement,\\\" shares Newcomer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2012 she visited and performed in Kenya at the AMPATH public health program and the Umoja Project school and sustainability program (in part supported by IHI). In Africa she performed in primary and secondary schools, performed at spiritual gatherings, visited homes and met with guardian and educational groups. She also performed at the Sally Test Children's Center, Neema School for children living with HIV and the Eldoret School for Children with Disabilities, all as a large public concert at AMPATH/Moi Hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011 and 2012, Carrie joined Parker J. Palmer for a special collaboration called \\\"Healing The Heart of Democracy: A Gathering of Spirits for the Common Good,\\\" based on his book Healing the Heart of Democracy. This collaboration was designed to create a new political conversation and reclaim our common narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout her career, she has created several presentations and PBS specials and worked extensively with beloved authors, scientists and progressive theologians, including Barbara Kingsolver, Jill Bolte Taylor (Transformative Stories), Phillip Gulley (Home and Habitat), Marcus Borg, Jim Wallis, Brian McLaren and Scott Russell Sanders (Wilderness Plots, Myths, Miracles, Lyrics and Lies, Four Friends).\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie nationally and internationally facilitates workshops and presents keynotes on the topics of songwriting, spirituality and vocation at colleges, universities, and spiritual communities, retreat centers. Newcomer, a Quaker, cuts across secular and spiritual boundaries. In recent years, she has emerged as a respected and recognized artistic voice for the progressive spiritual community.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-og.jpg\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":667},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/20/44/91-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.carrienewcomer.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/CarrieNewcomer/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/carrienewcomer\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"carrienewcomer\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.jamminjava.com/event/1267791?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
