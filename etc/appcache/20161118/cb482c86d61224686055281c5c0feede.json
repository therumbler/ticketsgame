Ray Band\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Amy Ray (Indigo Girls) will be coming through town with her top notch band to play songs from her acclaimed 2014 solo country release, Goodnight Tender. She will also include a select group of songs from her earlier solo releases. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor decades, Ray has performed with Emily Saliers in the Indigo Girls, and their ongoing success derives, in part, from intricate, ethereal harmonies, from the interplay of their distinct voices and sensibilities. Ray also has turned up the volume in her solo career as an ax-slinging rocker, producing six albums with punk edges and defiant, powerhouse vocals. In both capacities, she integrates the personal with the political, the dynamics of relationships with principles of progressive social justice. \\r\\n\\r\\nRay\u2019s 2014 release, Goodnight Tender marks a dramatic departure from those formats and themes, though her vocals, even when snarled at high decibels, always convey a rending ache that serves folk, punk, country, or any refrain tinged with pain. Ray convened artists she trusts with fiddle, banjo, dobro, pedal steel, guitar, mandolin, bass, and drums, and then arranged their microphone placement like an old-school sound engineer to create an authentic, vintage sound, gently imposing Strum And Twang on her Sturm Und Drang. \\r\\n\\r\\nLegendary country songwriter, Harlan Howard famously summed up country music as \u201cthree chords and the truth,\u201d and Goodnight Tender offers the kind of stripped-down melodies; honest, hat-in-hand emotions; and keening pedal steel and old-time strings that once emanated from tear-stained, honky-tonk jukeboxes. In her take on the early Nashville Sound, she sings movingly about dogs, pills, Duane Allman, and heartache. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI love to scream and growl, but I also love the soft, sweet singing of artists like George Jones,\u201d Ray says, \u201cso I slowed the tempo, got into a lower register, and let the songs and the musicians around me dictate a different direction. I was tempted to slip a political song in here, but I wanted this album free of anything that defines identity in any way.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat she strove for instead was the rush of pure feeling. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want the laborious arrangement process \u2013 I wanted recordings I didn\u2019t have to mess with too much,\u201d she says. \u201cSo these songs are more visceral than intellectual, with a strong, wistful sense of setting that enables you to sense the creek and the dirt as well as the unrequited love. I wanted a record that sounds good and feels right when you\u2019re driving down a rural road.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nRay enjoys plenty of opportunities to road-test these songs on her secluded, wooded property in north Georgia, where banjos and bluegrass still echo throughout the mountains. \u201cAt some point, those sounds are bound to seep into your life,\u201d she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Ray released a live record, The Tender Hour from her days thus far, touring with her country outfit.\\r\\nShe is working on a new batch of country songs to play live and to bring into the studio in the coming year.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1200},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":375},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":250},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-og.jpg\",\"width\":1638,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":125},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":625},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":813},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/75/99-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.amy-ray.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/AmyRayDaemon\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/AmyRay\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"AmyRay\"},{\"id\":1711401,\"name\":\"Chely Wright\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"CHELY WRIGHT\\r\\nI Am The Rain\\r\\nThe opening chords of the first track, \\\"Inside,\\\" on award-winning, singer-songwriter, author, and activist Chely Wright\u2019s new record, I AM THE RAIN, are direct, purposeful, and intense \u2013 a sound that defines the brilliant album. After more than five years away from the spotlight, and through a heroic personal and creative journey, Wright has returned with the release of a long anticipated new CD. And as she begins to sing the lyrics of \\\"Inside,\\\" her confidence, intelligence, and poetic ambition quickly come into focus.\\r\\nWhen it came time to record her new album, Chely knew it was going to be different from everything she had done in the past. Scheduled for release on September 9th, Wright and multiple GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning producer/artist Joe Henry (Allen Toussaint, Bonnie Raitt, Carolina Chocolate Drops) approached the work as a new beginning. Her recent songs were coming from a place of total openness and spoke to the kind of self-discovery that changes lives.\\r\\nPutting her talents as a singer-songwriter to the fore-front, the beginnings of which can be seen with producer Rodney Crowell on her 2010 record LIFTED OFF THE GROUND, becomes fully formed on I AM THE RAIN. Crowell actually pointed Chely to Henry and he quickly became a vital influence and contributor to I AM THE RAIN. \u201cJoe\u2019s a visionary,\u201d Wright says. \u201cHe taught me to understand that a great deal of making music is intention, and then to trust those intentions all the way. As terrifying as it could be expressing some of these feelings, those have become my best moments. That let me reach for my best self and trust what I found when I did that; and to not be afraid about being imperfect. Instead, just be able to let go.\u201d\\r\\nOn her new album, Wright finally realizes all those dreams of making music that comes from her deepest soul. She has arrived, and we are among the lucky beneficiaries.\\r\\nHer 2010 Random House memoir, LIKE ME, describes a life of dizzying heights as well as terrifying lows. The truth is told, no matter how painful it might be. As the artist wrote about her coming out as a lesbian, she also struggled with facing all the trauma and inner turmoil she had been through.\\r\\nGetting there for Wright has been a lifelong journey. Born in Kansas City, Missouri, she grew up in a musical family in the small town of Wellsville, Kansas. The young Wright starting singing professionally at age 11, and by her senior year of high school was working as performing musician at the Ozark Jubilee, a country music show in Branson, Missouri. After graduating, the young Kansan went directly to Nashville as part of the music production at Opryland USA theme park. Wright landed her first label deal in 1993 with Mercury/Polygram and immediately started getting serious attention in country music circles. In 1995, she was named Top New Female Vocalist by the Academy of Country Music, then scored her first Top 40 country hit in 1997 with \u201cShut Up and Drive,\u201d from her third album LET ME IN. Two years later, Wright\u2019s fourth album SINGLE WHITE FEMALE produced several hit singles, including the chart-topping Number 1 title track and her first gold album certification. In 2000, Wright and artist Brad Paisley co-wrote the duet \u201cHard to Be a Husband, Hard to Be a Wife,\u201d performing it at the Grand Ole Opry\u2019s 75th anniversary gala. There were other career highlights in the next few years, including a\\r\\nnomination for The Horizon Award Vocal Event of the Year at the annual Country Music Association Awards, Top Female Vocalist at the Academy of Country Music Association, a Top 4 debut for her 2001 album NEVER LOVE YOU ENOUGH, and being named to People magazine\u2019s \u201c50 Most Beautiful People\u201d list that same year.\\r\\nClearly the promising new singer had become an established national star, but like most careers, there would also be detours ahead. She left her major record label in 2003, and then the next year signed with a new independent label. Her single, \u201cBumper of My SUV\u201d became a hit with country radio and led to a new affiliation Dualtone Records. Wright\u2019s sixth album, THE METROPOLITAN HOTEL became a Number 7 hit on the Top Independent Albums chart, followed by Vanguard Records\u2019 release LIFTED OFF THE GROUND in 2010, the same year as publication of her self-penned memoir, LIKE ME.\\r\\nWright approached the writing process for I AM THE RAIN with a new found hope and excitement that a musical and lyrical expression unique to her alone was in her reach. \\\"I spent time in the hospital room with my mother while she was dying,\u201d Wright says. \u201cI\u2019d recently written 'At the Heart of Me,' and as my mom listened to the demo of that song, it became clear to me that it was time to start a new record.\u201d\\r\\nThe range of songs on I AM THE RAIN reflect a view into an entire lifetime. The first song recorded for the album, \u201cSee Me Home,\u201d set the stage for the rest of the songs to come. \u201cThat song became the rudder of the whole album, feeling like the saying, 'A rising tide lifts all ships.' Except in this case it was the rest of the songs.\\\" The lyrics remain the centerpiece of the album:\\r\\n\u201cTake my hand\\r\\nWalk me through the valley\\r\\nI\u2019ll fear not, with the sun to warm my face\\r\\nThere we\u2019ll stand\\r\\nIn the light of all that shall be\\r\\nKnowing home has never been a place\u201d\\r\\nWright quickly understood this was one of the most moving revelations of the album. It came over her like a wave. \u201cThe recordings became a life lesson,\u201d she says. \u201cSomething dramatic started happening as the album was unfolding. It required me to just take a seat and absorb these amazing musicians in the room. It was then that I could acknowledge that something was being sprinkled in the atmosphere and it made me able to just trust.\\\"\\r\\nPart of the power that Henry brought to the album included drummer Jay Bellerose, bassist David Piltch, guitarists Adam Levy and Mark Goldenberg, keyboardist Patrick Warren, saxophonist Levon Henry, and engineer Ryan Freeland. It was in this circle of players and people that Wright realized she had to change how she related to what was being created. \u201cI needed to get really quiet as we made the album. And I needed to recognize all those special moments in the day as they were happening. Several times during the sessions I felt a warmth wash over me as we were working. I had never experienced anything quite like it before.\u201d\\r\\nIn working on the songs that would become I AM THE RAIN, Chely discovered a way to shape not just the life she was hoping to live but also to see all the things that had brought her to this place. \u201cSometimes the past becomes a stalker, demanding to be acknowledged. And other times it can be a savior, where all the lessons learned are a gateway to the future,\u201d she says.\\r\\nNowhere is this more apparent than the song \u201cNext to Me:\u201d\\r\\n\u201cIf the world starts comin\u2019 at me\\r\\nAnd my armor rattles loose\\r\\nIf my compass starts to spinnin\u2019\\r\\nTell me can I count on you?\\r\\nTo say you\u2019ll stay next to me\\r\\nEven on the darkest days we\u2019ll ever know\\r\\nJust stay next to me\\r\\nNext to me forever please don\u2019t go\u201d\\r\\nAs Wright\u2019s new strength was gathering, she was able to look at her past and not fidget or flinch. Each new recording session offered insights and continued aspiration. \u201cAt the Heart of Me\u201d became one of her new mantras:\\r\\n\u201cOur faith is a well and deep down I can tell\\r\\nI\u2019m as thirsty as a mortal can be\\r\\nSilence abounds and is ringing through town\\r\\nLike a bell swinging high over me\\r\\nBut it won\u2019t matter now\\r\\nIt couldn\u2019t change what I see\\r\\nIf a thousand miles lay between us today\\r\\nYou\u2019re still at the heart of me\u201d\\r\\nIn speaking about the musical and emotional breakthrough of I AM THE RAIN, it is quickly clear that Chely could not have come to this place without writing her honest and telling memoir LIKE ME, where she speaks so openly of a life sometimes lived in the shadows, and the price that demanded. \u201cSomething became free in me when that happened. That process of freedom led to a new way of living. Before the book my object in life was to stay concealed, and I tended to write that way. But now I can write from the inside out, and it completely changes what I can do. I was no longer afraid.\u201d\\r\\nI AM THE RAIN is a new beginning, but one that is built on the bedrock work of a musical survivor. Milestones achieved include working with Joe Henry, writing with him, Edie Carey and Rodney Crowell, singing with Crowell, Emmylou Harris and the Milk Carton Kids, recording a Bob Dylan song (\u201cTomorrow is a Long Time\u201d): the list continues. Asked to sum up this hugely significant step in her life, Wright doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve given birth to a beautiful new baby and I would like people who see my baby to think it\u2019s beautiful too. That\u2019s how much this new music means to me. I am so very lucky it all came true.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1576},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":493},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":328},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-og.jpg\",\"width\":1247,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":164},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":487,\"height\":800},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":1067},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/76/09-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://chely.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/chelywright\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/chelyw\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/chelywright\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"chelywright\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.thebellhouseny.com/event/1317805?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
