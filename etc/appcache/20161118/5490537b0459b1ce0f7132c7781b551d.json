Talk\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"In October of 2012, July Talk celebrated the release of their self-titled, independently released debut album before a couple hundred bodies crammed into the claustrophobic, low-ceilinged confines of Toronto\u2019s legendary Horseshoe Tavern. Three years later and roughly 20 tours later, they were playing a homecoming date at Ontario\u2019s WayHome Festival for tens of thousands of ecstatic souls shouting the words of their songs back at them. Sure, a lot had changed in the interim: Their debut record had become a staple on modern-rock radio, earning the band a gold record in Canada and a Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year, while worldwide deals with Island, Polydor and Universal had spread the good word overseas. But one fundamental quality of July Talk\u2019s performances had remained unchanged: the jugular-seizing power of their confrontational, sensuous rock + roll. Whether you\u2019re experiencing it in the dingiest basement dive or the biggest festival field, a July Talk show makes you feel like you\u2019re part of some secret-society congregation. It\u2019s a gathering of kindred spirits united by a desire to escape the institutional pressures and LED distractions of our daily lives to reconnect with something real\u2014a primal, fiercely physical remedy for mind-numbing, glassy-eyed smartphone addiction. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it came time to draft the action plan for album number two, July Talk turned to the only focus group that mattered: those sweat-soaked fans slithering up against one another to lose their minds and morals at the band\u2019s electrifying concerts. That\u2019s the space where the blinding contrasts in July Talk\u2019s music\u2014Leah Fay\u2019s crystalline communiqu\u00e9s vs. Peter Dreimanis\u2019 three-cartons-a-day bark; greasy southern blues vs. urbane new-wave cool; sexual tension vs. cathartic release\u2014collide with thundercloud force, and their new record, Touch, represents its perfect, lightning-in-a-bottle distillation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt was easy to create a vibe and sound direction for the new record,\u201d says Dreimanis, \u201cbecause we literally just looked at our live show and what was fun about it, what kind of people came, and what sense of community you felt in the room. We\u2019ve never been about drawing the stage line\u2014that was our mandate from the beginning, and with our live show, we\u2019re really about breaking that down so that we\u2019re in the room as much as our audience. We wanted songs where we can grab people by throat and show them something unique\u2014the kind of songs that feel incredible in a sweaty room.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThematically, Touch has been inspired by our human experience over the past few years, just as much as our time spent as a band on the road.\u201d Fay adds. \u201cTouring constantly provides a strange view of the world because you\u2019re in transit more often than you\u2019re still. We became sensitive to the varying reactions we\u2019d get from any given audience depending on the cultural norms and politics of a place. Because humans love to categorize in an effort to understand, Peter and I were often perceived as these opposing forces, representing \u201clight vs. darkness\u201d, \u201cfemale vs. male\u201d, \u201csweet vs. scary\u201d blah blah blah, with each of us just dying to get a word in edgewise. These types of assumptions had a massive influence on the way we wrote the lyrics for this album because we knew we didn\u2019t want to feed into that sort of boring archetype. We became drawn to the idea of what it actually means to be a living breathing human. It\u2019s messy and visceral and unpredictable.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt seems to get easier every day to disconnect from the people around you,\u201d Dreimanis observes. \u201cLeah and I started to see human touch as this pure thing\u2014this antidote to a world that had become obsessed with mirrors and screens. We became fascinated with that moment where two bodies can actually touch and experience each other honestly. There are so many substitutes for that now, there are so many ways you can get a lesser version of that feeling elsewhere. And that\u2019s terrifying. You\u2019re always able to keep that slight amount of distance from actually having a face-to-face, eye-to-eye conversation with somebody.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re touring, you have very fleeting and sometimes vacuous relationships with people outside of the band,\u201d adds bassist Josh Warburton. \u201cIt puts you in a perfect mindset to start looking at the various technological interactions we have and see them in a different, potentially dehumanizing way.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Touch, human connection becomes a full-contact sport: Dreimanis and fellow guitarist Ian Docherty power songs like \u201cAsk You\u201d and \u201cJohnny + Mary\u201d (not a cover of the namesake Robert Palmer classic) with punked-up aggression, while the glam-rock stomp of \u201cBeck + Call\u201d (featuring guest growls from throat-singing phenom Tanya Tagaq) showcases the wrecking-ball swing of Warburton and drummer Danny Miles. And throughout it all, Fay holds court in the fray with a switchblade-wielding swagger she only hinted at on the first album. If that record channeled the blues, this one\u2019s all about the bruise. And that in-your-face immediacy was further encouraged by the album\u2019s producer, Ian Davenport, tapped for his work with kindred spirits Band of Skulls.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThere was a real warmth to the records he had made,\u201d Warburton explains. \u201cYou could identify the personality of the performers in the songs. Sometimes, you can get fairly automated when recording on computers. Ian encouraged us to not use any click tracks, and we did very limited overdubbing. Generally, we would just track a song until he was up in the control room dancing. He had this little captain\u2019s hat on, and if he was up actually physically moving and dancing, you knew you were onto something.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor July Talk, that collaborative spirit goes beyond recording\u2014it\u2019s crucial to the very way the band presents itself to the world. Warburton and Dreimanis come from a filmmaking background, while Fay boasts a contemporary-dance and performance-art pedigree; together, those multi-disciplinary skills have yielded a visual aesthetic every bit as striking as the band\u2019s music. \u201cBecause our experience extends outside of music, we\u2019re always working as a collective,\u201d Dreimanis says. \u201cWe want everything created under the July Talk moniker to come from the same place.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat philosophy extends from the stark, black-and-white videos, to the mugshot-style photos, to the brutalizing ballet of Fay and Dreimanis\u2019 onstage interactions, all of which serve to reinforce the fuck-or-fight showdown at the core of July Talk\u2019s signature songs. Touch continues to play up that dynamic, as the lascivious \u201cLola + Joseph,\u201d the dirty-disco grind \u201cPush + Pull,\u201d and the bittersweet, smoke-ringed serenade \u201cStrange Habit\u201d revisit the sort of dialogue-driven, pop-noir narratives that drove first-album favourites like \u201cGuns + Ammunition\u201d and \u201cSummer Dress.\u201d But true to the album\u2019s communal intent, Fay and Dreimanis\u2019 relationship here isn\u2019t so much \u201che said\u201d/\u201cshe said\u201d as \u201cwe said,\u201d whether the two singers are taking the piss out of macho misogyny over the \u201cPassenger\u201d-styled shuffle of \u201cLike a Man\u201d, or skewering coked-up, self-absorbed hipsters on the searing \u201cJohnny + Mary.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe easiest thing to write about is heartbreak and exes and failed love,\u201d Fay explains, \u201cand I feel like we covered that on the first album. Time passes and your worldview expands, and suddenly injustices are pissing you off more than the thought of your ex-lover. You notice one messed up thing about the way society functions and suddenly realize how deep-seated close-mindedness and a lack of communication are at fault for almost everything wrong with the world. It\u2019s like, we can only do so much and get so far by staring at each other, engaging in a two-way yelling match and letting our egos duke it out on stage every night. We can shed more light, and connect with more people while facing outwards standing side by side, listening just as much as we speak\u2026 or sing, in this case.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt all comes back to that community we feel in the room when we play,\u201d Dreimanis adds. \u201cI\u2019m constantly drawing on the moments I\u2019ve seen in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll that changed my life forever. Like, I remember walking into the Starlite Room in Edmonton when I was underage, and the door guy let me in to see the Constantines play, and it was the same way people talk about going to church for the first time. It was the most powerful thing I had ever seen. I felt the same way the first time I saw Iggy Pop. When I step out on stage, I want to make people feel alive and like they\u2019re in a very special place and provide them with a little hope and faith in rock + roll and its power as a borderline religion.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd you\u2019ll find no more persuasive sermon than Touch\u2019s closing title track. As the song steadily builds from desolate dissonance into a raging, piano-pounded anthem, Dreimanis and Fay reassert the album\u2019s key mantra in no uncertain terms. \u201cWe get so tired and lonely,\u201d they declare with gospelized gusto. \u201cWe all need a human touch.\u201d It\u2019s a reminder that no Snapchat selfie is a substitute for an intimate conversation, that no emoji provides the warmth of an embrace, that no YouTube concert video can instill that exhilarating feeling of leaping off the stage to crowd surf. Touch is music of the flesh\u2014the product of hoarse-throat howls, bloodied fingers slashed on the fretboard, and sticky bodies pressed against the barricades.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-og.jpg\",\"width\":1536,\"height\":1536},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/90/89-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.julytalk.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/julytalk\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/JulyTalk\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"JulyTalk\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":172337,\"name\":\"Mona\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Upon leaving the Midwest for Nashville, MONA quickly captured the attention of audiences and critics with driving, post-indie rock delivered with a rebellious energy. Looking back, singer and songwriter Nick Brown describes the band\u2019s vibe with a string of adjectives and nouns: fist pumping, white t-shirts, Marlon Brando, James Dean, sex and God. It all led to a major-label overtures and eventually a deal with Island Def Jam.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Brown tells it, he and his bandmates were more than happy to embrace the narrative as they were swept along through green rooms, VIP tents, label offices, television studios and the world\u2019s largest festivals. But in the end, major-label life wasn\u2019t the right fit for a band that had approached songwriting, recording and live performance in their own way from day one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cAs much fun as it all was most of the time, we wanted to be more than a trend,\u201d says Brown. \u201cWe\u2019re in this to connect with other humans.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Brown and his bandmates, it had always been about connection. The son of a Pentecostal preacher, Brown snuck in rock riffs and built up swagger between Sunday services, well aware of the faith tradition he shared with greats like Johnny Cash, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. In fact, he named the band after this grandmother Mona, a nod to heritage and a bygone era.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI came from a background of seeing music matter to people,\u201d he says. \u201cI learned early that where people came together for music, there was power.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMona got a taste of that power when their self-titled debut was nominated for the BBC Sound of 2011 award and won MTV\u2019s Brand New for 2011. They found themselves playing Later With Jools Holland, Conan and Leno, as well as being named to NME\u2019s Best New Bands. Supporting gigs for Noel Gallagher, Kings Of Leon and other large acts followed, as did appearances at some of the world\u2019s biggest festivals, including Glastonbury, Reading/Leeds, Coachella, Lollapalooza, Splendour in the Grass and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey built on that momentum with a second album, &quot;Torches &amp; Pitchforks&quot;, which showcased the band\u2019s seemingly endless reserve of creative energy, and brought focus to their signature sound. The sophomore effort again earned praise from fans and critics worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, on the eve of their third album, the Nashville rockers find themselves brimming with energy and confidence. They\u2019re also now a five-piece, with Zach Lindsay on bass, his brother Alex on guitar, Jordan Young on guitar, and Justin Wilson on drums. They\u2019ve seen a lot in just a few years and have emerged with a renewed sense of purpose and a fresh and vibrant set of newly penned songs that may well be the best of their career. Brown and his bandmates joke about creating a new genre: romantic ambient grunge alt.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a new label, a new team and an extraordinary new batch of songs, Brown says he\u2019s moreproud than ever of the band and the work they are doing. We have always been a tight knit group, but the vibe is the best\u2019s it\u2019s been and we are looking forward to bringing these songs tothe public.
