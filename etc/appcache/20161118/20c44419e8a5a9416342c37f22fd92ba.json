Can you imagine what a bummer it'd be if we weren't?\\\"\\n\\nFrankly, we can't\u2014and on their 10th studio album, Sorry for Partyin', Bowling for Soup prove that no matter what lame new trends may lurk outside their studio walls, they've got the hits, fits, shits and giggles to keep coming out ahead. From side-splittingly funny double entendres (the I-can't-believe-they-got-away-with-that lead single \\\"My Wena\\\") to call-and-response jams you'll undoubtedly be hearing in high schools\\nworldwide (\\\"No Hablo Ingl\u00e9s\\\"), Sorry for Partyin' features home of the funniest, most infectious songs of BFS' 15-year career. Of course, the album also packs some of the strongest, most confident songwriting in BFS' catalog, proving once again that these guys are masters of their craft.\\n\\n\\\"We've created our niche, and our niche is us,\\\" says Reddick, who formed Bowling for Soup in 1994 and today rounds out the Denton, Texas-based quartet with guitarist Chris Burney, bassist Erik Chandler and drummer Gary Wiseman. \\\"We know there are lots of people out there who think guys in their 30s shouldn't be writing about stuff like their 'Wena' and farts and beers and chicks.\\\" (Incidentally, you'll find all of the above on Sorry for Partyin'.) \\\"But I say why not? What should guys in their 30s be writing about? The economy? War?Organic food versus non-organic? We like funny movies, and we like to drink beer and talk smack about each other's moms. There's nothing contrived about it\u2014this is who we are.\\\"\\n\\nFor anyone else who thinks humor doesn't belong in music, let's also remember that this is who BFS are: A worldwide phenomenon with a string of hit singles (including 006's \\\"High School Never Ends\\\" and the 2004 MTV and radio smash \\\"1985\\\") to their credit. A fan-favorite live act whose chemistry is so innate they've never had to prepare a set list. And a TV and movie-soundtrack juggernaut whose Emmy-nominated contribution to Disney's Phineas and Ferb is literally the most widely heard cartoon theme song on the planet. Quite a step up from the salad days when they were handing out demos in Warped Tour parking lots\u2014even if the motives behind the music have stayed pure since then.\\n\\n\\\"There was nobody in Texas that sounded like us in 1994,\\\" Reddick remembers. \\\"Obviously you had the Orange County, CA, explosion that we felt a part of, because we were all ripping off the same bands. But as all the bands from that era started finding success, people started getting super-serious and making these really dreary or angry records. I'm not saying I don't like that stuff, but for us it's always been a case of 'Let's never do that!' We want to be that point of somebody's day where they can get off work and put us in and think, \\\"Okay, yeah: Everything else sucks, but this is\\nawesome.\\\"\\n\\nFittingly, \\\"awesome\\\" was an operative word during the Sorry for Partyin' sessions. Working with producer Linus of Hollywood (also Reddick's partner in the year-old Crappy Records label), BFS cut the album in a whirlwind 24 days at Wire Recording Studio in Austin, Texas, where the ideas flowed as readily as\u2026 Well\u2014let's just say there's a reason they titled one of Sorry's singles \\\"Hooray for Beer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We had close to a two-year break between the last record (2006's The Great Burrito Extortion Case) and writing for this one,\\\" Reddick says, \\\"so we were ready to have some fun.\\\" The anything-goes atmosphere lent itself to some interesting collaborations, too: After discovering that one of their musical heroes, former ALL vocalist Scott Reynolds, lived just blocks from the studio, BFS rang him up to make a cameo on \\\"America (Wake up Amy).\\\"  Fastball's Tony Scalzo, another Austin native and band friend, ended up collaborating on the rollicking kiss-off to an ex \\\"I Don't Wish You Were Dead Anymore.\\\" And, even if he originally dropped by just to hang out with his friends, Nerf Herder frontman/YouTube mega-star Parry Gripp also wound up making a cameo on vocals.\\n\\n\\\"It literally felt like more of a party than work, and I think that shows up throughout the record,\\\" Reddick remembers. \\\"People are gonna hear this and be like, 'Okay, well, it sounds like they had just a little bit of fun.\\\"\\n\\nOf course, they also got serious\u2014or as serious as you can when your album's lead single is a wiener joke. \\\"I think a song like 'My Wena' is a perfect example of us being like, 'Okay, whatever people think is as far as we're gonna take it, we'll just keep pushing things to the next level,\\\" Reddick explains. \\\"But there are a handful of songs on this record that really mean a lot, too. I think that was also a part of the studio environment\u2014whether we were goofing around or wearing our hearts on our sleeves, we weren't afraid to go for it.\\\"\\n\\nConsidering how long they've been a band, it's no small wonder that Bowling for Soup still find new ways to go for it in the niche they've carved out for themselves. But as Reddick notes, that sense of abandon is just the thing that's allowed BFS to tackle Sorry for Partyin' as if it were their first record, not their 10th. \\\"We've always said that the day it's not fun anymore, we're just not gonna do it anymore,\\\" he concludes. \\\"So why focus on the down side? Let's keep doing what we do best. Let's keep having fun.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":791,\"height\":1024},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":388},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":259},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-og.jpg\",\"width\":791,\"height\":1024},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":129},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":647},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":841},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/73/33-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bowlingforsoup.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/bowlingforsoup\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/bowlingforsoup\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bfsrocks\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bfsrocks\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1767225,\"name\":\"Bigloo\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1753595,\"name\":\"Bobgoblin\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Inspired by a vast array of musical styles including punk, post-punk, new-wave, 70s glam-rock, prog rock, and even orchestral music, BOBGOBLIN began to act on their inspirations in Denton, Texas in the early 90s, soon after lead vocalist/keyboardist Hop Litzwire and drummer Rob Avsharian met at the University of North Texas. After bassist Hech MaHech andf guitarist Lech Vogner helped get the concept off the ground, personell changes led to guitarist/bassist Tony Jannotta joining Litzwire and Avsharian in 1994.  The angular, tight, and aggressively melodic BOBGOBLIN sound, along with a socially-conscious and satirical ideology, was then set.  Aided by the strength of their intense performances, their visual concepts, and their 1994 independent release JET, the band was soon signed to a major-label.  After the group recorded their major-label debut, The 12 Point Master Plan, guitarist Jason Weisenberg joined the band, and they excitedly hit the road in support of their new release.  Though the experience in the corporate music business had some advantages, disagreement with the label over how the record and the band's concepts were being utilized, along with disagreement over the quality of the second recording, led to the termination of BOBGOBLIN's collaboration with the label.  The group then started a new project under the moniker AOJ, or Adventures of Jet (a reference to the group's first independent release).  Bolstered by the collaboration with My Records - Lagwagon front-man Joey Cape's new label - the first AOJ record, Part 3: Coping with Insignificance, met with a moderate amount of worldwide acclaim.  Inspired by the group's negative experiences in the corporate music world, Coping further showcased the band's ability to put insightful lyrics to infectious melodies and surround them with rich, powerful guitar sounds and distinctive keyboard counter-melodies.  Following Coping, the band parted ways with Weisenberg, and Jannotta went back to assuming the roles of both guitarist and bassist.  Litzwire, Avsharian and Jannotta continued on with another conceptually-minded AOJ record - Muscle.  Equating early muscle cars with the band's advancing age and natural inclination toward nostalgia, Muscle used car songs from the 60s as inspiration for the sound and tone of the record.  Though it was not as well-received with critics, some fans count the theatrical Muscle as a favorite among the group's collection.  Following tours in support of AOJ's first two records was a fairly dormant period; the band played a few BOBGOBLIN \\\"reunion\\\" shows while each individual ventured into a number of separate creative endeavors and along new paths in life.  However, the political and economic environment of the mid to late 2000s compelled the band to return to the original BOBGOBLIN concept and to the influences that led to their union several years before.  Though the group went on a tear in terms of writing material that expressed their opinions on a number of issues - from class inequality to corporate invasiveness - the now long-distance friendship among the band's members has resulted in a more gradual pace to the latest releases..  Their nearly complete LP collection, Love Lost for Blood Lust, is available in its current, nearly-complete state through many outlets including via this website, while their nostalgic, classic-arcade tribute EP is being held until full completion.  Already at work on another LP, the group also drops the occasional single - including the recently released \\\"PLAY\\\" - while they work toward their many musical and visual goals.  As energetic and intense onstage as ever, BOBGOBLIN plans a few short tours every year, continuing the rock and roll ride they started over 20 years ago.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"FvW3MT--FbY\",\"title\":\"BOBGOBLIN - DANGER (Extended Edition)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FvW3MT--FbY\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"T2Ncihpx1L4\",\"title\":\"BOBGOBLIN \\\"25 MILLION TO ONE\\\" 1998\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2Ncihpx1L4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FvW3MT--FbY\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bobgoblin.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/bobgoblinrock\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bobgoblinrock\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bobgoblinrock\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1379266?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
