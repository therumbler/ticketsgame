Their line-up is complete by newest members, rock solid drummer John Clelland, who appeared on 2015's 'Live With The Curse' release and Finnish keyboard whizz Christian 'Chrism' Pulkkinen.\\n\\nClassic Rock Magazine previously hailed their \\\"Titanic choruses\\\" and \\\"Soar away melodies\\\" and now it seems that life on the road supporting the likes of Dream Theater and Stratovarius has begun to rub off, as the group unveil their most progressive, sophisticated and mature collection of songs yet.\\n\\nSpecial guests on the tour are Sheffield's C.O.P. UK, whose vast touring experience with the likes of Saxon and Helloween has begun to pay off in earnest with them signing to German giants UDR Records, home of Mot\\u00f6rhead, Saxon, Alice Cooper \\u0026 Europe, who released their latest album 'No Place For Heaven'.\\n\\nEvolve will be a new name to most - for now! This quintet from Montreux, Switzerland, came to prominence last year when they won acclaimed Rock \\u0026 Metal producer Dennis Ward's (Unisonic, Krokus, Angra, Eden's Curse) song writing competition. Paul Logue of Eden's Curse happened to be on the judging panel and championed the band's cause. It therefore seems fitting that Paul should extend an invitation to the talented Prog Metal outfit to come tread the UK's hallowed boards with Eden's Curse in November. They are hotly tipped to impress! \\n\",\"artists\":[{\"name\":\"Eden's Curse\",\"mbid\":\"314e6f4b-9855-4cb3-aa48-562ff910a336\",\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6701347.jpeg\",\"thumb_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6701347.jpeg\",\"facebook_tour_dates_url\":\"http://www.bandsintown.com/Eden%27sCurse/facebookapp?came_from=67\",\"facebook_page_url\":\"https://www.facebook.com/edenscurseofficial\",\"tracker_count\":4156,\"url\":\"Eden'sCurse\",\"website\":\"http://www.edenscurse.com/\"},{\"name\":\"C.O.P.
