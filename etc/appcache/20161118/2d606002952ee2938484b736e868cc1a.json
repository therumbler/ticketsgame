Her sweet-but-sultry voice has been called \\\"angelic\\\" so many times, it's a miracle she hasn't grown wings: Imagine a less breathy Kylie Minogue merged with a more controlled Roisin Murphy (Moloko) and you have a good grasp on her classy voice that highlights any beat that flows behind it.  Whereas in the late 80s, the diva reigned supreme and made the music cower, Colette has kept it deliciously simple and always melodic, making the former choirgirl-cum-Chicago-house-siren a mainstay of modern dance music.\\n\\nAnd it's been that way for a minute -- as raves were starting to wind down throughout the nation in the late 90s, Colette was busting through the \\\"novelty act\\\" stereotype that kept many women DJs corralled like VIP ropes guarding a Hollywood hotspot. But ever since she started her SuperJane troupe with fellow Chicagoan DJs Dayhota, Lady D. and Heather (celebrating over 10 years), Colette's paved the way for other women seeking equal time behind the decks as their male counterparts. Things came full circle in 2006, when the Los Angeles transplant reunited with Heather for a stateside tour promoting the \\\"House Of Om\\\" mix they did together. It was a busy year -- Colette also played an intense set at Coachella, kept up her long running residency at \\\"World's Best Club\\\" Smartbar and toured with fellow Om house soldier Kaskade. \\nAnd no signs of slowing for Colette with her second artist album, Push...\\n\\n\\n\\nPUSH\\n\\nIf Push plays out anything like her first artist album, Hypnotized, Colette's endless nights will have been more than worth the effort. Hypnotized became the most downloaded dance album on iTunes (US), and featured dance floor burners like \\\"What Will She Do for Love\\\" (Billboard's No. 1 Dance Club Play Single) and the title track, which was licensed to The Devil Wears Prada soundtrack. In just a few years time, Colette was featured as a \\\"Newcomer to Watch\\\" in JANE Magazine, filed under \\\"Hot New Music\\\" in Interview Magazine, graced the cover of XLR8R, and named in URB's Next 100. \\n\\nJust like on Hypnotized, Push has got serious dance floor ammo with its tricky, funneled beats and overall playful vibe, but it can slink into dark-and-sexy mode too, making the record just as diverse as its cast.  Home and Garden, Santiago & Bushido, Drew K, Chuck Love, Fab, Lucy Woodward share production credit, to name a few.  Colette's sexy, jazzy alto is featured perfectly on \\\"If\\\" and first single, \\\"About Us.\\\" It easily could rock the airwaves on a Friday night mainstream pop station and slay the crowd at any dance club, and has already been remixed by tastemaker Derrick Carter. Showing off pop-savvy lyrics that are still perfect for the club, Colette sings of love lost: \\\"I'll tell you something that you need to know/ I'm sick of tryin' and I'm not so sure/ I've lost the feeling from so long ago/You say you love me but you don't care about us\\\"\\n\\nKeeping things varied four tracks in, \\\"Funny\\\" features Om: Hip Hop new signing and fellow URB \\\"Next 100\\\" featured artist Black Spade, and the resulting vibe is chill with a bit of swagger -- complete with shiny synths over a tripped-up tempo.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.djcolette.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/djcolette\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/DJColette\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/djcolette\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"djcolette\"},{\"id\":1340397,\"name\":\"DJ Heather\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"DJ Heather was named one of Chicago's Top Forty-Five Artists alongside Kanye West, Billy Corgan and Green Velvet!\\n\\nIn the past few years the Chicago house community has produced a number of innovative and distinct djs trained in the art of transforming tranquil dance floors into spaces of sheer bedlam and bliss. Their committed vision of undiluted musical appreciation, interactive communication, improvisation and basic integrity has brought greater attention to all the city's great djs including the genre busting DJ Heather. Widely regarded as one of the premier selectors in the nation, this Chicagoan demonstrates her skills and sharp deck acumen for the massives throughout the Windy City and the world at large with verve and undeniable talent.\\n\\n2005 marked DJ Heather's installment to the much heralded Fabric CD series, for the club of the same name. \\\"With [Fabric] 21 I had a concept in mind; most of the material had to have been played at the club to give it an honest feel.\\\" Judging by critics and house enthusiasts she has done just that. \\\"At the end of the day to make a room full of people happy is difficult to do. You become part mind reader , guru, sensei, educator, entertainer and babysitter all at once. All the experiences I have had, made who I am today. As a person and dj. I love what I do.\\\"\\n\\nIn 2006, DJ Heather toured extensively with Colette in support of their House of OM double disc release. Following worldwide accolades, in 2007 Om Records announced Summer Sessions 2 mixed by Om family members DJ Heather and Onionz. The release followed the success of the first volume of the series mixed by Groove Junkies, Chuck Love and DJ Fluid. In 2008 she joined fellow OM label artists - Colette, Fred Everything and Andy Caldwell - on the House of OM tour. Since 2009, DJ Heather and Colette have taken their Chi-town homegrown vibes on the road with their annual double billed tour, official named in 2010, Second City Sessions.\\n\\nWith over 15 years of experience behind her Dj Heather has grown to become one of the Windy City's main Dj exports. She is an artist who defies conformity, defines quality and continues to nurture her solid skills for soul music of the technological generation.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-og.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/78/38/45-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.ilovedjheather.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/djheather\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/djheather\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"djheather\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":630395,\"name\":\"Zebo\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Peering at the crowd from behind his thick-rimmed specs, head nodding like a metronome; his sound is one of confidence and controlled frenzy, as highlighted in Newcity Magazine, where he was honored in their annual Music 45 issue\u2014alongside the likes of Kanye West, Andrew Bird and Smashing Pumpkins\u2014as one of the top 45 musical artists in Chicago.  This was just after being listed in URB Magazine's \\\"Next 100\\\" issue and recently voted \\\"Best Local Dj 2010 and 2011\\\" by the Chicago Reader Viewer Poll.\\n\\n\\\"\u2026Zebo packs a cut-up crateful of styles, from hip-hop and B-more to French, Electro, Disco and even a nasty snippet of a techno track or throwback freestyle gem. While this maximal approach might be increasingly common among DJs who cater to the ADD-riddled mash-up club casualties, Zebo stays head and shoulders above the rest for knowing that just because you can, doesn't mean you should.  Skills can be honed, but taste can't be taught\u2026\\\"\\n\\nAlthough house and jungle dominated his early turntable diet, Zebo is a polygamous lover of music, and he hustled to find any opportunity to play, be it raves, loft parties, weddings, corporate parties, in-store events and fashion shows.  He is also an instructor at Columbia College teaching both a Club Dj part 1 class as well as an advanced part 2.  Outside of which he runs the Chicago-based, Hot Dog Records with partner Marco Morales.  A label that focuses on releasing any style of music and artists that represent Chicago.\\n\\nIt is this genuine love of music paired with incredible deck acumen that propels DJ Zebo beyond the reach of all the other DJs trying to out-reference, out-cred and out-mix each other, their varied selections resembling 10 pounds of shit in a 5 pound laptop.  Zebo's not simply wearing his musical heart on his sleeve\u2014as the WAV file tattooed on his ever-moving forearm might seem to indicate\u2014but actually spinning dance floor gold with both his technical abilities and intuition in reading the crowd, a modern day Serato-equipped Rumpelstiltskin.\\n\\nYet for all his vaunted versatility, no matter what direction his sets head, Zebo's initial love of jungle seems to subconsciously permeate his music at peak hour, with bombastic basslines rolling on and on underneath familiar hooks and clever samples.  Pitched-up, pitched-down, scratched-up and around, Zebo's a populist at heart, finding the redeeming values in both subterranean cool and overt pop\u2014it's a delicate tightrope to walk, but this DJ has the balance to pull it off.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.djzebo.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/djzebo\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/djzebo\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/djzebo\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"djzebo\"},{\"id\":1631011,\"name\":\"Jon Iler\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.primarychi.com/event/1370893?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
