years ain't a hell of a lot of time, but Futurebirds have filled 'em with a whole lot of living. Laying down their shoe-gazing country, harmonious psychedelia, and barnstorming, ragged rock both on record and in person, the Athens-based band presents a delicate balance on Hotel Parties, its third full-length record that explores the toils, joys, and struggles exposed by six years doing any one thing so intensely.\\n\\nBack in 2010, Thomas Johnson, Carter King, Dennis Love, Johnny Lundock, Brannen Miles, and Daniel Womack, emerged with a self-released EP that granted them entry to the kingdom of South by Southwest. That year also saw the birth of their debut LP, Hampton's Lullaby (released on Aquarium Drunkard's label Autumn Tone), which label boss Justin Gage called \\\"covered in kudzu and swathed in a blanket of humidity, Spanish moss, feedback and reverb.\\\"\\n\\nShortly thereafter, the gigs at University of Georgia house parties grew into tours across the country with Drive-By Truckers, Widespread Panic, Grace Potter, and others. The 2011 EP Via Flaminia and 2012 live record Seney-Stovall then coalesced into 2013's Baba Yaga, Futurebirds' second full-length. As Steven Hyden of Pitchfork proclaimed, \\\"the controlled chaos of Futurebirds' live shows translates on [Baba Yaga] like never before. You feel the energy, forgive any flubbed notes, and soak in the past-midnight revelry.\\\" \\n\\nBut Hotel Parties, arriving a full two years after Baba Yaga, presents a series of dualities.  Loving something and letting it go. Pining for success versus trying to staying true to yourself. The beckoning call of the road and the comforts of home. As a result, says singer-guitartist King, the LP represents Futurebirds' \\\"most concise effort to date all around, like some sort of accidental concept record.\\\"\\n\\nOn album opener \\\"Paranoia Letters,\\\" King sings, \\\"There's a stranger growing less strange every time I go out.\\\" But it is not King who is saying these words. Rather, his girlfriend back home in Nashville is calling out to him, detailing the toll that the last six years has taken on them. Both the lyrics and harmonies swirl like mist around Futurebirds as King's lover asks, \\\"ain't ya lagging from all that dragging of a life you've made in song?\\\"\\n\\nIt's this same fear, of how life on the road affects you, that Johnson addresses in title track \\\"Hotel Parties.\\\" In this world, \\\"cars don't pass like ships sailing in the night,\\\" he muses, and the line between downtime and performing is so blurred as to render one permanently \\\"on.\\\"\\n\\nLater, Daniel Womack confronts the struggles of loneliness and regaining his sense of purpose in \\\"Rodeo.\\\" His graveled voice stretches over every hole he digs and every effort he takes to climb out of them, proclaiming, \\\"I'll be damned if I ain't gonna grab the bull by the horns.\\\"\\n\\nWhile King, Johnson, and Womack share songwriting credits, the full band's collective effort makes Hotel Parties sound both weathered and evocatively fresh. Miles' bass serves as the barometer for the band's energy. Love's mastery of the pedal steel serve as both wallpaper and framed art\u2014filling out the sound of a bridge or a slow-burning solo across any track. And Lundock (having joined the group in 2013 with the departure of founding member Payton Bradford for a legal career) leads Futurebirds with malleable drum styles, utilizing sparse, delicate touches as precisely as three-quarter-timed waltzes and head-banging thrashes for when the band climbs and crawls over each another in a race to the end of the 51 minute-long record.\\n\\nWith Brian Paulson (Slint, Wilco, Son Volt) behind the knobs to mix Hotel Parties, Futurebirds allows a new voice into its circle of trust. According to King, Paulson \\\"brought out a lot of different focal points and layering ideas that we hadn't necessarily heard in these songs. Brian's track record speaks very loudly for itself, and we think he did a great job getting us out of our comfort zone.\\\" \\n\\nThat comfort zone has been born from lives lived together over the past six years\u2014of confiding in those with whom you're closest, not the legions of friends and fans dispersed across the country for one-night tell-all's.\\n\\nIt's not been an easy path for Futurebirds. Rather, it's been an uphill climb where every step must be taken. There's no elevator to swoop you up a level, no guidebook for these parts. \\n\\nOver the course of these three LPs, two EPs, and one live record, people have come and gone, yet, Futurebirds seems to stay. Some things came out as they liked and some pills have been bitter. But sometimes, six years just ain't enough time to tell.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":683},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/29-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.futurebirdsmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/thefuturebirds\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/futurebirds\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Futurebirds\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Futurebirds\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1757311,\"name\":\"New Madrid\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"From the southern wilds of Athens, GA comes young four-piece, New Madrid. Their music is a dynamic mixture of underwater-psych-rock that engages the listener in fully textured aural landscapes, both on record and live. Their acclaimed 2012 independent debut, Yardboat - engineered by David Barbe (Deerhunter, Drive-By Truckers) at Chase Park Transduction- displayed the band's inherent talents and introduces a distinctive sound budding with sonic energy. In their ever-thriving music- mecca hometown, Yardboat garnered \\\"Album of the Year,\\\" and the band's formula of constant touring and creative restlessness earned them \\\"Artist of the Year\\\" at the Flagpole Music Awards. In the summer of 2013, New Madrid signed to local start-up Normaltown Records, and entered the studio to record what would become Sunswimmer. Their second full-length finds New Madrid further exploring depths of psychedelia and textured noise.\\n\\nThe new record presents a New Madrid audibly settled into itself. Focused into a collection of collaborative songs, the band delves into a more experimental soundscape. Recorded solely on analog tape during a cool, wet July \u2013 once again under the direction of David Barbe - Sunswimmer telegraphs a newly confident self-knowledge, from the assertive opening riff of the churning \\\"Manners\\\" to the infectious driving beat behind \\\"Forest Gum.\\\" The tracks here are more concentrated than Yardboat's offerings, but fans of New Madrid's expansive tendencies will be sated by the record's final 25 minutes, which are characterized by two linear compositions (\\\"Homesick\\\" and \\\"And She Smiles\\\"). The album's body of music was conceived as a singular piece and is best consumed that way.\\n\\nIn a digital age, when song snippets skip cross-country on the backs of broadband, Sunswimmer is a testament that making music for shared space still remains.

Growing up in a family with a musical father and where brothers handed down bass guitars to younger siblings like old sweatshirts, Stone was fronting a band and playing in motorcycle bars around his hometown of Covington, Georgia, when he was 12 years old.\\n\\nNow living in Atlanta and with a searing new album, Marshes, due out on September 18 via This Is American Music, Stone is making a name for himself with an enthralling fusion of throwback southern vibes, indie rock hooks and a wall-of-sound resonance.\\n\\nA lifetime of listening to classic country and soul artists like Patsy Cline and Otis Redding imbued the young songwriter with a retro pop and strong vocal appreciation from a young age, though finding his own voice has been an ongoing process. His 2013 debut album, Good Go Bad, saw Tedo delving into glam jams and alt country rock, though Stone admits he wasn't fully assured of his sound yet.\\n\\nWhile hanging out in Athens, Georgia and playing with the endless array of talented young musicians there, Stone realized his songs were sounding different live, evolving into a mixture of Dinosaur Jr's wailing guitars and Neil Young's raw emotion; and he liked it. Taking that new energy into the studio last year, Stone recorded Marshes straight to tape, live in a room with a core group of friends. Under the guidance of producer and engineer Drew Vandenberg (Deerhunter, of Montreal), Stone this time around establishes himself as a pure rock and roll songwriter, with invigorating rhythms, addictive hooks and keenly layered guitars.\\n\\nCertain tracks throughout the album, like \\\"By Your Side\\\" and \\\"Home to It\\\" seamlessly infuse myriad musical elements at once, simultaneously echoing 60's sock hop riffs, T. Rex-styled big amp fuzz and soaring post-rock solos, all while Stone fearlessly croons with a fierce timbre. Reflecting the swampy mires that Stone grew up around, Marshes is an album of deep grooves and assured writing that will find its way into your rotation with an endlessly repeatable appeal.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":369,\"height\":514},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":369,\"height\":514},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":418},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":279},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-og.jpg\",\"width\":369,\"height\":514},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":139},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":369,\"height\":514},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":369,\"height\":514},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/72/35-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.TedoStone.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/tedostone\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/tedostone\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"tedostone\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://variety-playhouse.com/event/1368639?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
