Since then a couple of years have past, and U.D.O. has become a well known name in the heavy metal world. Within a short period of time U.D.O. became to be a global presence, with pure sound and the unmistakable voice of Udo Dirkschneider. Closely tied to the name U.D.O. is ACCEPT, founded by Udo Dirkschneider and Michael Wagner (later to become a top producer) in Solingen, which was the predecessor of U.D.O. Already back then, Udo gave the band the label \\\"unmistakable\\\". The path ACCEPT took was marked with classics like \\\"Breaker\\\", \\\"Restless and Wild\\\" and \\\"Balls to the Wall\\\". After the breaking up of ACCEPT in 1987, a large fan community followed Udo Dirkschneider to U.D.O.. The loyal fans were not dissapointed, for Udo amazed them with new U.D.O..\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting with the first albums \\\"Animal House\\\" in 1988 and \\\"Mean Machine\\\" in 1989 U.D.O. proved to be pure heavy metal without any \\\"Trend-Sound\\\" influences. Both Albums continued where ACCEPT had left of in 1986 with \\\"Russian Roulette\\\". \\\"Animal House\\\" was played in by Peter Szigeti (guitar), Frank Rittel from WARLOCK (bass), Mathias Dieth from SINNER (guitar),Thomas Franke (drums) and of course Udo Dirkschneider (vocals). When \\\"Mean Machine\\\" was released in '89 U.D.O. had a totally different look. From the line-up which had played on \\\"Animal House\\\", remained besides Udo only Mathias Dieth (guitar). New were Andy Susemihl (guitar), Thomas Smuszynski (bass) and Stefan Schwarzmann (drums).\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though the unwritten U.D.O. law \\\"No-Keyboards\\\" was broken, U.D.O. achieved a amazing success, with the album \\\"Faceless World\\\" \\\", produced by ex-ACCEPT drummer Stefan Kaufmann. At first disputed, it turned out to be, with Udo Dirkschneider (vocals), Mathias Dieth (guitar), Wolla Boehm (guitar), Thomas Smuszynski (bass) and Stefan Schwarzmann (drums), U.D.O.'s most sold album so far.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter \\\"Timebomb\\\" in 1991 U.D.O. , with a slightly new crew (Frank Fricke now played the guitar in place of Wolla B\u00f6hm), was temporarily put on ice by Udo Dirkschneider, to bring ACCEPT back to life. From 1992 'til 1996 ACCEPT performed in a highly watched over reunion, and Udo released three albums together with his old ACCEPT colleges, until the definite end was called for ACCEPT and U.D.O. was revived. For this Udo Dirkschneider called Stefan Kaufmann (guitar), J\u00fcrgen Graf (guitars), Fitty Wienhold (bass) und Stefan Schwarzmann (drums) to him. Udo Dirkschneider and Stefan Kaufmann then went, together with the new line-up, \\\"back to where we started\\\" and with that to recording on the \\\"Tribute to Judas Priest\\\". On this compilation of JUDAS PRIEST cover songs U.D.O. performed the track \\\"Metal Gods\\\". On this track everything just fits together. This was not only through Stefan Kaufmann's input, but also do to his acting as an counterpart to Udo Dirkschneider.\\r\\n\\r\\nA successful mix, which was improved on \\\"Solid\\\" in 1997. This is when the rythmic guitar tracks and Stefan Kaufmann's solos came from. The other parts besides Dirkschneider and Kaufmann were taken by J\u00fcrgen Graf (guitar), Fitty Wienhold (bass) und Stefan Schwarzmann (drums). The title of the album shows what kind of music Udo always wanted to play: hard and heavy. And the success proved U.D.O. right. Solid was placed on the \\\"Rock Hard\\\" reader charts for more than a year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Solid\\\" was followed by \\\"No Limits\\\" in 1998; another U.D.O-Master-Piece. The songs are full of power and continue were U.D.O. had left of with last album. Udo Dirkschneider (vocals), Stefan Kaufmann (guitar), Stefan Schwarzmann (drums), J\u00fcrgen Graf (guitar) and Fitty Wienhold (bass) - the guys from U.D.O. amaze the fans with their enjoyment to play - and that world wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nUdo Dirkschneider (vocals), Stefan Kaufmann (guitar), Lorenzo Milani (drums), Igor Gianola (guitar) and Fitty Wienhold (bass). With the release of \\\"Holy\\\" Udo and Stefan decide to go back to the roots and get the original sound out of the cellar. The reaction of fans and journalists left no doubt that this was the right step. A World Tour has been the logical consequence of this album. There are important lineup changes, on the second part of the \\\"No Limits\\\" tour (1999), Igor Gianola, former guitar player of the swiss band GOTTHARD, replaces J\u00fcrgen Graf. When the \\\"No Limits\\\" Tour is finished Stefan Schwarzmann quit the band, and on the \\\"Holy\\\" Tour (2000) Lorenzo Milani take its place. This lineup goes further succesfully 'till 2004.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-og.jpg\",\"width\":1772,\"height\":1772},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/13/15-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"g_u_q1dZpFY\",\"title\":\"U.D.O. - I GIVE AS GOOD AS I GET (2011, official clip)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g_u_q1dZpFY\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g_u_q1dZpFY\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.udo-online.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/udoonline\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/udoonline\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"udoonline\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.treesdallas.com/event/1207441?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
