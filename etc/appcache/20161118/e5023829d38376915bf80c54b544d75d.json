The dynamic trio instantly began turning heads with their signature \\\"industrial surf\u00adgaze\\\" sound. On their Polaris Prize nominated follow\u00ad up, Hard Boiled Soft Boiled, Odonis Odonis masterfully crafted a sonically divergent record that pushed their sound into new territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nOdonis Odonis' latest epic, Post Plague, delivers a powerful blend of industrial, electronic and Sci\u00adFi. Odonis Odonis' post-\u00adapocalyptic anthems construct scenes of sci-\u00adfi horror and saturate them with industrial strength synth beats. Dean Tzenos' vocals sit clear and upfront, delivered with a foreboding intensity accented by his synth motifs and soundscapes. Denholm Whale's carefully crafted bass figures / electronic percussions are strategically placed like demolition charges throughout the sonic foundations of each track that Jarod Gibson, like some futurist architect, constructs. On Post Plague, Odonis Odonis delivers the kind of hypnotic, pulsing destruction that you can't wipe away.\\r\\n\\r\\nPost Plague inhabits that impending reality of synthetic experience which forces us to realize what we are: vulnerable, frantic creatures yearning for an authentic present / future. Jeff Goldblum, in the acclaimed motion picture The Fly, reminds us that we must take a \\\"deep penetrating dive into the plasma pool,\\\" and take stock of ourselves before we lose something profound. Something that may be necessary to ward off a pending anthropogenic apocalypse.

Their shared fascination with dance culture, rhythm, and the unknown, along with their lifelong immersion in the arts, began to manifest as a collective ethos. Before long, DOOMSQUAD had mushroomed into a full-scale art project.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band's debut LP, Kalaboogie, was a self-recorded album made in the woods of Northern Canada. Released in 2014 on Toronto label Hand Drawn Dracula, Kalaboogie was a meditative survey of the Canadian landscape. Desiring connection with a national dialogue, the album was an explicit attempt to create uniquely 'Canadian' music by drawing on modes and myths from the wilderness.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, DOOMSQUAD have continued to explore new themes and forms of expression. 2015's EP, Pageantry Suite, marked a deviation from the band's typically dark and meditative sound. Disco synth tones flavoured with African-inspired beats contrasted more upfront vocals, and aggressive lyrics addressing misogyny, consumerism, and hollow artifice. Pageantry Suite was their first and so far only effort to have been recorded in a studio.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year will see the release of DOOMSQUAD's sophomore album, Total Time, out April 29 on Bella Union and Hand Drawn Dracula. Inspired by some of their favourite artists \u2014 Georges Bataille, Richard Tuttle, Tanya Tagaq, and Genesis P-Orridge \u2014 the band traveled to the New Mexican desert to write and record. Moving through their own circadian rhythms, they fell into aural harmony while experiencing the passage of time solely as beats per minute. Total Time is all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSonically, DOOMSQUAD embraces their roots; on Total Time they offer dark, pulsating beats interspersed with hypnotic, incantatory jams. The album opens with the enticing dance of 'Who Owns Noon in Sandusky,' which was written to inspire the nakedness in us all, a song to wake up our inner clocks and reclaim our circadian time. 'Solar Ass' was written as a love song to a donkey, a song for paying respect to the smaller, underappreciated elements that carry us through our contemporary lives. The songs on Total Time are meant to lead you through a genderless experience of transition to owning time, losing time, and becoming timeless, while providing a platform for you to dance through your consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon returning home from New Mexico, the band continued to draw inspiration from the Toronto arts community, which is vast but extremely supportive and close-knit. Their friendships and connections led to some fortuitous collaborations, including one with Canadian avant-garde legend Mary Margaret O'Hara, whose otherworldly vocals grace 'The Very Large Array.' The driving, dirty bass lines, and analogue layers of effects come care of Graham Walsh (Holy Fuck), who produced and mixed the album.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe record features a number of other contributors: Mike Haliechuk of Fucked Up plays guitar. Industrial noise experimenter David Foster aka HUREN offers vocals on 'Russian Gaze.' Colin Fisher and Brandon Valdivia of free-jazz duo Not the Wind, Not the Flag bring instrumentals.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrucial to the album are galactic twin brothers Josh and Jesse Hasko, who use their near psychic proclivities to create spatial and hauntingly psychedelic soundscapes as North America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter years of traveling the US, hanging around in the Everglades, gay clubs, small desert towns, and deep forest encampments, happily submitting to wherever they broke down, the Haskos found themselves in New Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving abandoned their respective disciplines of Fine Arts and Classical music, the brothers applied their experiences of a drop out existence to a band called North America. Touching on themes of violence, childhood, exhaustion with conventional American ideals, and the thin veil between spiritual worlds, the Hasko's music is heavily influenced by dreams, UFOs, and the desert.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years, the connection between DOOMSQUAD and the twins has deepened and this summer they're combining forces: the Haskos have joined DOOMSQUAD, which will take this project furthur than it's ever gone before.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":743},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":232},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":155},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":743},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":77},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":387},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":503},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/61/19-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.doomsquadmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/elDoomSquad\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/elDoomSquad\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"elDoomSquad\"},{\"id\":1732085,\"name\":\"Vallens\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Robyn Phillips spent her early years in Toronto playing lead guitar in several bands.

Soon after, Vallens began recording a full length record with friend Jeff Berner of Psychic TV at his now defunct studio Galuminum Foil in Brooklyn, followed by several months recording songs at Candle Recording with Josh Korody (Beliefs, Wish).\\r\\nThe project debuted live in December of 2015 and quickly captured the attention of music critics, promoters, and the local music scene.
