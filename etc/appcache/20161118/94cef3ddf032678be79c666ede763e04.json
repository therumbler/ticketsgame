Upon sharing lead single \u201cAtlantis,\u201d the track hit #2 on Spotify\u2019s Viral Chart, #1 on HypeMachine, and garnered over four million streams across platforms. Bridgit also revealed the official \u201cAtlantis\u201d video with VICE\u2019s Noisey who dubbed it \u201ca masterwork in craft and atmosphere.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nBridgit Mendler had already released a platinum single (\u201cReady or Not\u201d), dropped an album that went Top 30 on the Billboard charts and No. 1 on iTunes (Hello My Name Is...), and twice toured the U.S. Yet when she began working on her first studio recording in four years, she was nervous. \u201cI had been performing and promoting for so long that I hadn\u2019t caught up and figured out who I was. I wasn\u2019t the same as the girl who made my debut album.\u201d \\r\\n \\r\\nShe wanted her music to reach a new depth of vulnerability, of transparency\u2014and she knew she had to do this by exploring her personal heartbreak through her love of writing.  \u201cEach of my songs,\u201d explains the L.A.-based artist, \u201cwould be based on an unfiltered story from my life. This is what I have gone through and this is who I am because of it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNemesis is a four track collection of self-assured and bittersweet relationship songs that entwine pop with hip-hop, alternative R&B, even dancehall. It finds Bridgit confidently bending her voice like a sonic shapeshifter navigating emotional bullets. Penned in the studio with co-producers Book (Mischa Chillak) and Spencer Bastian, the EP sees Bridgit reach a new level of vulnerability and transparency. Bridgit's next single, the soulful, rhythmically tugging \u201cDo You Miss Me at All,\u201d was written in her car: \u201cI was feeling overwhelmed by sadness,\u201d she says. \u201cI just sang out the words and melody at the same time.\\\" If her 2012 debut album launched her out of the songwriting gate, Nemesis is the career-changing work that has tested her mettle.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://bridgitmendlermusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/BridgitMendler\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bridgitmendler\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bridgitmendler\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1743619,\"name\":\"KAYE\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"As frontwoman of the critically acclaimed New York-based group San Fermin, Charlene Kaye has played network television, major festivals like Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits, and many sold-out shows, including on tours with St. Vincent, Arctic Monkeys, and alt-J, among others, which earned her rave reviews from the likes of Rolling Stone and The Wall Street Journal.
