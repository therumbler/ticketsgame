Matt has been a figure in the East Tennessee music scene for the past ten years. Located in Knoxville, TN, he has performed in several bands as well as working as a solo artist. Matt has shared the stage with the likes of CAKE, Drivin' n' Cryin', Will Hoge, Kevn Kinney, Roger Clyne (of The Refreshments), Garrison Starr, Tim Lee, Mic Harrison (of the V-Roys and Superdrag), Doug Gillard (of Guided By Voices) , Two Cow Garage, Col. Bruce Hampton & the Code Talkers, Zac Brown, Graham Colton, Brian Vander Ark (of The Verve Pipe), The Features and a seemingly never-ending list of talented independent artists who aren't getting the widespread respect they deserve from points around the globe. Matt spent his earliest years with a band called Magpie Suite, which received a bit of notoriety around the southeast and produced three albums. Until recently, he worked devotedly with his latest band Plan A, where he wrote songs, sang, played guitars, played cards, drank beers, and often drove from show to show along the east coast in a big, brown van named Daisy. Plan A released and supported two full length albums between 2004 and 2009. Through solo performances and band appearances, Matt has averaged over 200 shows a year for the past few years, an average that would be higher if it weren't for a very unfortunate thumb-wrestling accident in the spring of '06. At home, Matt also performs in a duo called Adapted Wood with long time friend Tod Sheley every Monday night, and in several other projects featuring a number of talented musicians. He can also be found sitting in from time to time at random shows in the Knoxville area.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":799},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":400},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":266},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-og.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":799},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":133},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":666},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":799},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/78/81/23-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.therealmattwoods.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/mattwoodsmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1408329,\"name\":\"The Piss Poor Players\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"THE PISS POOR PLAYERS\\r\\nFor the past 33 years The Piss Poor Players have been battling with the realism of demons.

They have struggled with alcoholism, drug addiction, poverty, crazy women, hopelessness and the wildest twists and turns life can throw at one. They have looked death in the face on more occasions than one could count. Raised into a life of music they have deep roots in old school Country and Blues. Metal and Rock N Roll, Punk Rock, and East Coast Hip Hop. They don\u2019t write songs that people want to hear. They write songs about the things they know about. The things they have seen and done, and the things that have happened to them. Day by day they deal with the struggles of life while maintaining steady focus on making real music for folks who give a shit about what is really going on. Being Piss Poor is a way of life they accepted a long time ago. Nothing has ever been given to them. Instead of laying down on there backs and feeling sorry for themselves like so many have done. They have taken their life experiences, and turned them into works of art. There wouldn\u2019t be The Piss Poor Players if their lives would have been easy.
