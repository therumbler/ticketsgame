Now, on their fourth studio album Crush, drummer Adam Deitch, guitarists Adam Smirnoff and Eric Krasno, bassist Erick \u201cJesus\u201d Coomes, keyboardist Neal Evans, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet player Eric Bloom deepen that sound by channeling the sonic freedom and infectious energy of their incendiary live show.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Lettuce and Co- Produced,  recorded/mixed by Joel Hamilton at Brooklyn\u2019s Studio G, Crush first came to life on the road, with the band developing new material and testing it out live as they toured. \u201cWe\u2019ve all noticed that our music goes into a lot of different directions onstage, and we wanted to capture that in a way that we never really have before,\u201d says Coomes, who names classic psychedelia and \u201890s hip-hop among Lettuce\u2019s key inspirations on Crush. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more wide-open in terms style, but it still stays true to the funk.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe follow-up to 2012\u2019s Fly, Crush finds Lettuce brilliantly infusing their psychedelic and hip-hop sensibilities into bass-heavy funk. With its spidery guitar work and hypnotic beats, \u201cPhyllis\u201d is a delicately sprawling epic that embodies what Deitch refers to as \u201ca chill-hop vibe that\u2019s kind of the flip-side of all that powerful uptempo funk that people might expect from us.\u201d On \u201cGet Greasy,\u201d Lettuce give a nod to the groove-fueled EDM subgenre known as future funk, building off its highly danceable rhythm with a blissfully loose and horn-laced arrangement. And on \u201cHe Made a Woman Out of Me,\u201d guest vocalist Alecia Chakour lends her bluesy growl to a scorching take on Bobbie Gentry\u2019s 1970 country-soul classic.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether paying homage to Led Zeppelin on the fiery and guitar-driven \u201cSilverdome\u201d or delivering a deeply riveting and richly textured hip-hop medley with \u201cOresteia,\u201d Lettuce maneuver through Crush\u2019s kaleidoscopic sound with sophisticated ease and powerful synergy. \u201cMore so than any of the records we\u2019ve done before, this album is very much about the improvised grooves and improvised solos,\u201d says Krasno. \u201cInstead of going at it like, \u2018Here\u2019s a melody, now here\u2019s a guitar solo, here\u2019s another melody, here\u2019s a sax solo,\u2019 everyone\u2019s leaning on each other in a way that\u2019s completely unspoken. It\u2019s all of us moving as one unit and creating this new sound together.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Lettuce, that sense of unity and togetherness has much to do with a camaraderie that\u2019s only intensified over the lifespan of the band. Formed in 1992, when several band members attended a summer program at Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music as teenagers, Lettuce was founded on a shared love of legendary funk artists like Earth, Wind & Fire and Tower of Power. After returning to Berklee as undergrads in 1994, Lettuce started playing in local clubs and steadily built up a following that soon extended to cities across the country and then throughout the world. Releasing their studio debut Outta Here in 2002 and its follow-up album Rage! in 2009, the band dedicated the coming years to balancing their frequent touring with involvement in a host of other musical endeavors (including Evans and Krasno\u2019s role as founding members of acclaimed soul/jazz trio Soulive).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, Lettuce have watched their fanbase expand as they\u2019ve hit bigger and bigger stages and earned their name as a can\u2019t-miss festival act. And in making Crush, the band had no trouble harnessing the spirit of their explosive live show. \u201cSome of these shows we\u2019ve played over the past couple years have been so amazing, it\u2019s like you go home a different person,\u201d says Coomes. \u201cI\u2019m sure remembering those moments in our minds and our hearts helped bring out something special when we were recording these new songs.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nSo while Crush offers everything from all-out party jams to headphone-ready journeys into space funk, each track was born from an unabashed joy and love of live performance. \u201cThat energy we get when it\u2019s prime time and we\u2019re about to go onstage and we\u2019re just excited beyond belief\u2014that all came out on this new album,\u201d says Deitch. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that the band is rising, and it\u2019s a really beautiful thing.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":266},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":266},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-og.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":266},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":266},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":266},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":266},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/08/31-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":266}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bBjDtjd_qVw\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.lettucefunk.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/lettucefunk\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/LettuceFunk\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/lettucefunk\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"lettucefunk\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1772818,\"name\":\"Jaw Gems\",\"startTime\":\"2017-01-13 21:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"Jaw Gems, an electronic outfit from Portland, Maine, is a collective of young, experimental producers bringing beat-music \u2013 traditionally programmed and played on samplers \u2013 to a live band setting. The mesmerizing result is a harmonic convergence.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombine legendary beat-makers like J Dilla and Flying Lotus with indie rock and electronic icons like Deerhunter and Washed Out, then add Radiohead\u2019s dreamy ambience and you begin to approach the sound of Jaw Gems.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cDilla is the common thread for how we all met and began playing together,\u201d says keyboardist Hassan Muhammad. \u201cNot many people in Portland knew about him seven years ago, so through various friends we were all pointed out to each other and we were blessed with the opportunity to hold a weekly residency at a bar, playing all the stuff we liked and getting increasingly weird.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSince their start in 2009, the band has been exploring sonic and rhythmic ideas that emphasize interlaced melodies and heavy grooves. First outfitted solely with dueling vintage synthesizers, a drummer, and an electric bassist, Jaw Gems have now incorporated a Roland sp404 and the Juno 106 analog synth, going on to employ the beat- repeating, sample-warping technologies of the present to help create their wall of sound. Armed with new gear, Jaw Gems were able to evolve their beats, trigger intricate samples, and alter sounds in an increasingly advanced way. \u201cYou can do so much with these devices, and we all have our own ways of using them,\u201d says bassist Andrew Scherzer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis August, Jaw Gems will release their second album, HEATWEAVER, via STS9\u2019s\\r\\n\\r\\n1320 Records. The 14-tracks create a thickly layered transcendental auditory world \u2013 a meticulously crafted collection grounded in a modern electronic aesthetic. HEATWEAVER melds neck-breaking, hip-hop synthesizers and nostalgic atmospheres, while simultaneously touching on elements of psychedelic funk, neo-soul, and punk rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nJaw Gems likes to keep their recording process relaxed to allow for creative diversity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting up shop in a makeshift home studio, the band hunkers down and lets their songs come to life. \u201cWe like to make a retreat out if it,\u201d says drummer DJ Moore, noting that all of the musicians have been involved in other projects. \u201cMaking music is how we chill, and the album naturally unfolded once we were all committed to being in the same place together for some time.\u201d The title itself came from thinking of the album visually. \u201cWe thought about what images the music evoked throughout the whole process, and when someone said \u201cheat weaver,\u201d we all felt it embodied our sound,\u201d he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nPut four beatmakers in a room together for a week, and the outpouring of ideas could be endless. \u201cAs we develop as individual musicians each of our sounds morph and evolve in different ways, so when we come together to record we all bring something new to build upon,\u201d Moore says. \u201cOur creative process is never the same,\u201d says keyboardist and sampler Quist. \u201cWe tend to refine our ideas in rehearsal, figuring out how to play them as a band, but most of our ideas start off as a beat one of us made. On HEATWEAVER, we let some of our beats stay in a more bedroom beat format, and others we revamped to sound a lot more live.\u201d In this case, Jaw Gems was left with a solid compilation attesting to their evolution as tenacious genre-bending producers. \u201cJaw Gems have done the magic trick of delivering a thoroughly listenable instrumental album that you can also sing along to,\u201d says electronic musician Daedelus.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it\u2019s this uninhibited sound that has also attracted the likes of other notable musicians. T3 of J Dilla\u2019s Slum Village calls HEATWEAVER \u201cmad fresh.\u201d Lettuce drummer Adam Deitch says, \u201cThe swing that J Dilla made famous on an MPC beat machine in the late \u201890s is embedded in Jaw Gems\u2019 musical DNA, just as much as soul and funk. They have created a psychedelic, jazz-rooted, West African feeling.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLyle Divinsky of Colorado\u2019s The Motet has declared them his \u201cnew favorite band\u201d and describes their sound as \u201ca completely unique brew of hip-hop, jazz, funk, avant-garde, and classical music, steeped in originality and psychedelia.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the release of their debut album, Blades Plural, Jaw Gems has gone on to share stages with icons such as STS9, Lettuce, and Daedelus. The band also emphasizes matching their work with video. Some examples include Akai Floss, which reached over 7,000 views independent of any label or premiere.
