revelations don't come easily. Once you do really know yourself though, anything is possible.\\n\\nShayley \\\"Dayshell\\\" Bourget realized he needed to make a big change in his life before he could truly be happy. In 2012, after three years and two seminal records playing and singing clean vocals for Southern California's Of Mice & Men, Shayley left the band to the shock of fans everywhere.\\n\\nHowever, he emerged from that tumult stronger than ever. Receiving a call from old friend and drummer Raul Martinez, they decided to jam together. There were no rules. There were no \\\"scene\\\" restrictions. It was just going to be fun. Adding bassist Jordan Wooley to the fold, the trio tapped into something kinetic. Fusing together warm melodies, gnashing spacey guitars, and heavy rhythms, Dayshell came to life.\\n\\n\\\"I want to push boundaries,\\\" he goes on. \\\"This is our own style. It might be heavy at the forefront, but there's beauty behind that. It encompasses all of my influences from Deftones and Led Zeppelin to Incubus and Enya. I like to call it 'Fresh Metal'.\\\"\\n\\nTheir first single \\\"Share With Me\\\" exudes that indefinable and inimitable energy. Dayshell recorded the track and released it online. It went viral among fans, and Sumerian Records reached out that same day. Now, it's the leadoff to the band's self-titled 2013 debut album for the label. For Shayley, it's especially personal.\\n\\n\\\"It pretty much tells my whole story,\\\" affirms the singer and guitarist. \\\"I would wake up with anxiety, get paranoid, and start drinking in order to feel normal. On the chorus, I'm reaching out for a hand though. I want to become the person I was born to be. I want to be better at what I love to do. At the end of the day, it's a huge 'thank you' to the fans who have supported me and never gave up. I come out of the gate completely honest. Nobody can say anything because I say it all here.\\\"\\n\\nThat honest carries through the rest of the record as well, and it's speaks the loudest. Shayley holds nothing back, and that's why Dayshell is going to stick with listeners for a long time to come. He concludes, \\\"I want people to keep an open mind and interpret this the way their heart wants to feel. There's more out there for all of us. If somebody gets inspired, that's incredible. I knew in my heart that this band was always going to happen. This was part of the plan I've had for my whole life.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://dayshellband.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/DayShellMusic/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/dayshell\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"dayshell\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1768091,\"name\":\"Spoken\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Starting in 1996, Spoken quickly became a mainstay in their local music scene due to a relentless work ethic and performance schedule. Shortly after forming, Spoken was signed to their first record deal with Metro 1 Music, on which they released three albums and a greatest hits compilation. With the release of their first album, On Your Feet (1997), and continuing through their second record, \u2026What Remains (1999), the Spoken sound was a combination of rap meets metal and a bit of melodic rock. The third full-length release, Echoes of the Spirit Still Dwell (2000) contained a heavier, more melodic approach to song writing, with songs like \\\"Forevermore\\\" and \\\"This Path\\\" generating repeated rotations on various modern rock radio and video programs across the country.\\n\\nSpoken signed to Tooth & Nail Records to release their next album, titled A Moment of Imperfect Clarity. This, and their subsequent albums on Tooth and Nail, highlighted an evolving sound in which first melody and then a post-hardcore sound were introduced and stressed. The band shot music videos for \\\"Promise\\\" and \\\"Falling Further\\\"\\n\\nIn 2005, Spoken released Last Chance to Breathe. The style changed even more, becoming more based on screams than heavy guitar work. A music video was shot for \\\"Bitter Taste\\\", a single from the album, featuring Cory Brandon Putman of Norma Jean.\\n\\nOn September 25, 2007, Spoken released the album, Spoken. The sound was heavier and more mature, with both heavy vocals and heavy guitar work. Matt Baird, the lead vocalist for Spoken, said this about their sound: \\\"Our new record has a lot of diversity. There are songs that are heavier than anything we've done before, and there is a song that is mostly piano. The songs are really all over the place as far as a similar style or genre, but it works. I think the record is extremely cohesive. I can't wait for people to hear it.\\\"\\n\\nSpoken has made multiple trips across the United States as well Japan, Germany and Sweden. Averaging over 100 shows a year, they regularly see attendance into the hundreds, filling venues to capacity throughout the U.S.\\n\\nIn late 2008, Spoken disappeared from the Tooth & Nail roster. Several months later the band announced that they had left the label and Alien Patrol was to release a digital re-release of Echoes of the Spirit Still Dwell, an album that had an extremely limited release early in their career.\\n\\nSpoken has been working on a new record since 2009 with producer Jasen Rauch. They have revealed that the record is finished and will be released on February 12, 2013 through E1 Music and will be called, \\\"Illusion\\\". The band will support the album with a spring tour alongside Volbeat and Danko Jones. The first single, \\\"Through It All\\\", was released on December 18, 2012.\\n\\nThe band announced via their Facebook page on November 28, 2014 that they would release a new album in 2015. A later interview with singer Matt Baird revealed the band will be recording at least one song in January as a promo track and then the remainder of the album will be recorded in May 2015. Recording is done and is in the process of being mixed and mastered.\\n\\nOn July 15, 2015 the band signed a new contract with Artery Recordings.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":131},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":131},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":131},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":131},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":131},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":131},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-og.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":131},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":77},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":131},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":131},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":131},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/32-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":131}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.spokenmusic.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/spoken\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/SpokenOfficial\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"SpokenOfficial\"},{\"id\":1768092,\"name\":\"3 Pill Morning\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"3 Pill Morning isn't just another rock band and they'll leave you with anything but a musical hangover.\\n\\n\\nForged in the hard rock proving grounds of Minneapolis, MN in 2004, 3 Pill Morning could be described as trial by fire. Simply put, music was never a question for lead vocalist Jeff Stebbins and failure was never an option. While other musicians were moving from project to project and band to band, Stebbins took a different path, consistently growing and evolving 3 Pill Morning from a rap-rock act, into an anthemic rock band no one can deny.\\n\\nIt took the better part of 5 years, over 500 shows, and a hand full of member changes to finally click. Nothing would stop the evolution of 3 Pill Morning. Early on, Stebbins found a natural chemistry with guitarist Ryan Walch and he quickly became a key member of the band's core. As the pieces fell into place, the final line up came into focus with the addition of bassist Ryan Lee and drummer Trent Laugerman. The band forged on, hitting the road, solidifying their sound, and cementing their spot as a national touring act sharing the stage with the likes of Hollywood Undead, Sevendust, In This Moment and Trapt. Through 3 Pill Morning's consistent mile grinding and road warrior focus, the band has built an inspiring fan base with die hard supporters nationwide.\\n\\nAfter a chance introduction in a city better known for honky-tonks and banjos than gut-wrenching riffs, the band found a creative match with Nashville based producer Jon King (Augustana, Throwing Gravity, Future Leaders of the World) . They quickly went to work writing, recording, and re-vamping songs and ideas to take that next sonic step. In 2012 the band signed a recording contract with King's Page 2 Music and New York based A2Z Entertainment. \\\"We were really intentional with everything this time around,\\\" comments Stebbins, \\\"as a band we had a specific vision for what we wanted to do and that really set the tone for everything from the writing process down to the artwork and suits we wear live.\\\"\\n\\nTwo months of all night recording sessions later, the band emerged from the studio with a renewed vigor and a slick concoction of fist pumping riffs, infectious melodies and an energy that can only be described as relentless. 3 Pill Morning's label debut 'Black Tie Love Affair' pegs all the dials and pulls no punches. The band's lead single 'Rain' immediately raced into the top 100 Active Rock songs, the album hit #62 on the Billboard Heat Seekers chart and their sleek video capturing the underdog story 'Skin' has lit up YouTube viewers world wide. All signs are positive that this band's determination and fan-centric demeanor will keep them on the radar for years to come.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":720,\"height\":480},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":720,\"height\":480},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-og.jpg\",\"width\":720,\"height\":480},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/32/33-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.3pillmorning.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/3pillmorningband\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/3pillmorning?ref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/3pillmorning\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"3pillmorning\"},{\"id\":1380159,\"name\":\"Thousand Frames\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Thousand Frames is the newest alternative rock band that is making waves in the Denver music scene.
