The band received critical acclaim for the intricate harmonies, nuanced musicianship and impressive songwriting skills showcased on their previous self-released albums, \u201cJudgement Day\u201d (2011) and \u201cDestiny\u201d (2014), while songs such as the redemptive \u201cNah Look Back\u201d and the spiritually enriching \u201cJah Glory\u201d earned comparisons to legendary reggae outfits including England\u2019s Aswad and Steel Pulse, and Jamaica\u2019s beloved Third World.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of few self contained groups (as opposed an artist\u2019s backing band) within contemporary Jamaican music, Raging Fyah is now poised for a significant impact upon America\u2019s vast reggae landscape (dominated by homegrown bands) with the Spring 2016 release of Everlasting, their debut album for VP Records\u2019 Dub Rockers imprint. Recorded live at Kingston\u2019s legendary Tuff Gong Studios producer Llamar \u201cRiff Raff\u201d Brown (whose credits include Stephen and Damian Marley, Richie Spice, T.O.K and 2016 Grammy Award winners Morgan Heritage) incorporates broad based influences, various acoustic subtleties, and a few guest artists, all of which enhances as well as expands Raging Fyah\u2019s established reggae identity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWorking on this album was very exciting but challenging; we wanted to stay within the context of who Raging Fyah is, but we never want to box ourselves in either,\u201d explains the band\u2019s bassist/backing vocalist Delroy \u201cPele\u201d Hamilton. \u201cBeing free spirited as musicians, we spend many hours jamming all kinds of music when we rehearse so we said why not use some of what we feel naturally on our record?\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title Everlasting was chosen to convey the durability of Raging Fyah\u2019s music and the long term effect collaborating with Riff Raff has had on the band. \u201cWe had the choice to work with any producer we wanted, locally or internationally and we chose Llamar,\u201d says Raging Fyah\u2019s keyboardist/backing vocalist Demar \u201cKeysie\u201d Gayle. \u201cWe have learned so much from him; the way he helped to shape our sound is an everlasting lesson.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe set opens with Everlasting\u2019s title track, its hypnotic dub effects and majestic brass summoning the eternal strength of Jah love while heralding the extraordinary musical experience presented on the album\u2019s 14 tracks. From the carefree, easy skanking vibe of \u201cHappiness\u201d to the unshakable spirit of resiliency on the roots rocking \u201cTry Again\u201d; from the melodious crusade for \u201cJustice\u201d to the lush harmonies and gentle soulfulness of the \u201cReady For Love\u201d, Raging Fyah\u2019s varied experiences and broadening perspectives in recent years contributes to the sonic sophistication that characterizes Everlasting. The band has performed in such far-flung locales as Siberia, Russia and the South Pacific island of New Caledonia; they\u2019ve developed a significant fan base throughout Europe where they have toured extensively and they are now gearing up for their first U.S. tour, supporting American reggae band Stick Figure on the latter\u2019s Set In Stone tour beginning March 10, 2016 in San Diego. \u201cFrom our last album until now, we have traveled so much, and experienced different scenarios that we felt should be a part of Everlasting,\u201d says Pele.\\r\\n\\r\\nPele, Demar and Anthony Watson (drums, backing vocals) met while studying music at Kingston\u2019s Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts, under the tutelage of Ibo Cooper, former keyboardist with Third World. They joined forces with veteran guitarist Courtland \u201cGizmo\u201d White and formed Inside Out in 2002 before changing their name to Raging Fyah in 2006. The band spent years backing artists at major stage shows in Jamaica; their long held ambition to perform original music became a reality when Kumar Bent signed on as lead singer in 2010. Kumar attended Edna Manley College a few years after his band mates, initially studying piano; at Cooper\u2019s insistence he began writing and singing his own songs. Kumar\u2019s supple expressive tone persuasively delivers Everlasting\u2019s array of personas, including the playful suitor on the album\u2019s first single \u201cDash Wata\u201d, the Jamaican roots revolutionary on \u201cRaggaMuffin\u201d and the enlightened soldier in Jah Army on \u201cWake Up and Live.\u201d Each mood is ideally complemented by the band\u2019s finely honed, faultlessly taut grooves.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike their previous albums, Raging Fyah has chosen to collaborate with select guest artists on a few of Everlasting\u2019s tracks. Rising roots sing-jay Jesse Royal joins the band in criticizing greedy, uncaring leaders on \u201cHumble\u201d; dancehall star Busy Signal, who was so impressed by the Everlasting recording sessions he is featured on two irresistible tracks, the pop flavored \u201cWould You Love Me\u201d, and the lilting \u201cLive Your Life\u201d, also featuring Compton, California raised reggae star J Boog, who cites Raging Fyah among his favorite bands.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaging Fyah collectively writes their songs, many conveying personal meaning while simultaneously addressing wider issues. \u201cWondering\u201d asks how did we get here, seemingly questioning a relationship gone wrong but the song was penned in Haiti as the band considered the descent of the first independent Black nation into one of poorest countries in the western Hemisphere, despite its plentiful resources. While emphasizing personal accomplishments through small achievements \u201cGet Up\u201d was written to motivate the progress of Africans throughout the Diaspora, notwithstanding the lingering effects of historical atrocities: \u201clocked up in captivity, shipped across the Caribbean sea, so many years of slavery I still don\u2019t know my identity\u201d, sings Kumar, the purity of his emotionally wrenching vocals framed by Demar\u2019s classically influenced piano, a representation of the culture imposed on slaves, prior to the segue into an emancipating reggae rhythm. \u201cWe put the classical part in to represent colonialism,\u201d Kumar explains, \u201cbecause the song is about a belief system, the advancement of the Black race, creeping first then walking as a people and taking pride in our history.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain to be one of 2016\u2019s most celebrated releases, Everlasting signifies a milestone in Raging Fyah\u2019s career by raising the bar on their already lofty musical standards. \u201cThe challenging lyrics on Everlasting challenged what we were able to do as musicians,\u201d says Demar. \u201cMusically, we kept our roots but went way beyond them because there is not just one shape to fyah, it takes on different forms.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1440},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-og.jpg\",\"width\":1333,\"height\":2000},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":975},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/27/45-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.ragingfyah.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/raging.fyah/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ragingfyah\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ragingfyah\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.catalystclub.com/event/1365531?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
