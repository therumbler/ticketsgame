While Freddie was captivated by the guitar and wanted to be a performer, Benny just enjoyed the music and the opportunities to share it with the older brother he admired and adored.  The boys used to race home from school to catch the last few minutes of a radio show called \u201cIn the Groove,\u201d where they heard the music of artists such as Louis Jordan, Charles Brown and later, T-Bone Walker. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the family moved to Chicago in the early 50\u2019s, what began as parallel exposure and experiences for the brothers ultimately diverged as Freddie went in one direction and Benny pursued other opportunities that came his way. While best known today as a bass player, Benny played guitar during many of his gigs in the early years, both locally in Chicago and on the road.  A last-minute request to sit in with Freddie\u2019s band to cover for Robert Elem at the Squeeze Club gave Benny his first introduction to playing bass, with some \u201con-the-job training\u201d at its finest!  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the late 50\u2019s Benny played guitar with gospel group The Kindly Shepherds, and is on a handful of their recordings for the Nashboro label (guitar and background vocals) from that time.  He was also playing bass with Freddie King at legendary Chicago clubs such as the Squeeze Club and Walton\u2019s Corner.  While at Walton\u2019s Corner, Benny met R&B singer Dee Clark, and was invited to join him on the road.  Within a few days, his first exposure to touring and life on the road began, at none other than The Apollo Theater in New York, and continued at other legendary theaters including The Uptown Theater in Philadelphia, The Howard Theater in Washington DC and The Regal Theater in Chicago.  Benny played in the band with Phil Upchurch, and cherishes their friendship to this day.  It was an exciting time, during which Dee had his Billboard hit \u201cRaindrops\u201d (1961).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile on the road, Benny met Leroy Crume and Richard Gibbs, of the Soul Stirrers, and was invited to join their tour.  At that time, electric bass was unheard of in gospel music and it was controversial within the band, but the group\u2019s manager, Jesse Farley, recognized his potential contribution and hired Benny.  That pioneering move laid the groundwork and inspiration for the gospel music of today, in which bass guitar plays an integral role.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the mid-to-late 60\u2019s Benny returned to Chicago, where he continued to play locally in various bands and also made a handful of his own recordings for the Leaner Brothers\u2019 One-Derful and M-Pac! Labels.  Not long after that, Benny re-joined his brother on the road, when the band was living every musician\u2019s dream, playing at major festivals (domestic and international) and on the same bill as artists including Dionne Warwick, BB King, Solomon Burke, Eric Clapton and even opening for Grand Funk Railroad at Madison Square Garden in New York.  While at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1973, members of Freddie\u2019s band were asked to sit in with Memphis Slim, and Benny plays bass on the recording of that act, \u201cMemphis Slim \u2013 Very Much Alive and in Montreux.\u201d  Mickey Baker was part of that performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1976, the dream became a nightmare.  Benny lost his band mate, best friend and big brother all at once, after Freddie\u2019s untimely passing at age 42.  Completely devastated and physically debilitated by the unspeakable loss, Benny spent the next two years as a recluse, trying to make it from hour to hour, day after day.  Finally, when Chicago bluesman Mighty Joe Young approached him, Benny gathered the courage to face the stage once again.  With barely enough strength or stamina to make it through that first gig, Benny pushed forward, and it was the catalyst to getting him back on his feet and into the mainstream of the blues once again.  One of the highlights of their time together was appearing in the 1981 film \u201cThief\u201d while playing live at The Wise Fools Pub.  After eight fantastic years on the road together, Mighty Joe had to stop touring due to health issues, and Benny planned his next move.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading to New Orleans was the next significant turning point for Benny.  There, he met Marva Wright, \u201cBlues Queen of New Orleans.\u201d  He joined the band and served as Marva\u2019s bandleader and bass player for more than twenty years.  Internationally recognized beyond the borders of New Orleans, Marva Wright and the BMW\u2019s played all over the world in addition to being mainstays of the French Quarter music scene.  In 2010, Marva passed away and Benny lost a cherished friend and bandmate, once again.\\r\\n  \\r\\nA recently-released (in 2014) homage to his musical history, Benny is very proud of his newest CD, Journey. The deep roots and wide diversity of his musical influences blend into a signature style he calls \u201cReal Blues\u201d and performs with his band of the same name.  In many ways, Benny Turner\u2019s journey is just beginning, and promises to be one fine ride!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":768},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":240},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":160},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-og.jpg\",\"width\":1980,\"height\":1584},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":80},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":400},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":520},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/98/95-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/bennyturner.realblues\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1381356?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
