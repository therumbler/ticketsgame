Named by Mixmag as one of their 'Hot Six', Sonny Fodera has had an impeccable 2013 with releases on a slew of today's biggest house labels including a debut album, Moving Forward, on the reputable Cajual Records. Renowned for his smooth technical mixing, last year saw Fodera play at some of the world's greatest clubs such as Air, Ministry of Sound, DC10, Booom! as well as a residency at Ushuaia Tower.\\r\\nSonny's journey as a producer begun at the tender age of 16 when he was making Hip Hop, but it was not until the likes of Derrick Carter, Inland Knights and James Curd visited his homeland that his passion for four-four took firm shape. Fast forward in time and the budding 27 year old has stood shoulder to shoulder with his inspirational heroes of whom now all credit him for his dexterity both behind the decks and in the studio with Fodera receiving praise from some of the genres most established veterans, from Cajmere to Derrick Carter all the way to the 'Godfather of House' Frankie Knuckles.\\r\\nSuch recognition from the industry greats is testament to Fodera's knowledge and talents. Proving he is anything but a neophyte, the producer's sub-genre ranging productions attest to his immense understanding of the genre with his tracks being supported by some of today's biggest DJs. Cajmere was so fond of Fodera's abilities he began collaborating with him as well as offering him an album deal on his label Cajual Records. \\r\\n\\\"We just really vibe together and get along really well\\\" says Fodera on his relationship with the legendary house stalwart. \\\"We understand each other's jokes and he's extremely easy to work with. He's just an awesome guy and acts like a mentor to me and has helped me a lot. He's very consistent and pushes you, which is good.\\\" \\r\\nAccording to Fodera, last year's highlights were \\\"playing with David Morales and Simon Dunmore at Defected's party at Ushuaia Tower, DJing at DC10 in Ibiza, getting signed to Defected and also releasing an album on Cajual Records\\\". These are all remarkable feats for any artist his age and require immense work ethic and passion, traits which Fodera has in spades. When asked about the biggest challenges a new producer faces Fodera states it is \\\"getting signed to the right labels\\\", however looking back on his discography only proves this is a challenge he continues to pass with flying colours having had releases on the likes of Defected, DFTD, Cajual Records, Farris Wheel Recordings, Guesthouse, and of course his very own label Beatdown - all within the last year. \\r\\nNow in the age of the popularisation of electronic music the young breakthrough producer is a reminder of a stronger than ever underground scene as he continues to showcase his true-house sound to every corner of the globe. Looking to continue last year's momentum into 2014, the burgeoning artist has collaborations planned with some much respected artists including further work with Cajmere and Gene Farris, another album on Cajual Records due in March as well as a touring calendar that will undoubtedly top the previous one. With no sign of resting on his laurels Sonny Fodera aims to persist with the fervour and integrity that has got him this far, forming a bright and promising future where he will undoubtedly be looked up to by future generations himself.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/sonnyfodera\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":631399,\"name\":\"Walker & Royce\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"New York City\u2019s Sam Walker & Gavin Royce have been producing their emotive, subdued and groove-heavy deep house for just two years\u2014 but almost from the start, they were touted as future stars.

As things usually go, it was a bit of luck that got them off the ground: Crosstown Rebels boss Damian Lazarus noticed one of their very first releases, a remix of SAARID's \\\"Future Lately\\\", on Nervous Records. He began playing it in all of his sets and reached out to the duo for more. The result was the Crosstown Rebels EP \\\"You're Not Welcome\\\" and with that, Walker & Royce was launched into the dance music mainstream.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the same time, Walker & Royce released a track on an OFF Recordings compilation that started as a sleeper but went on to become a house anthem: \\\"Connected\\\". The song quickly became a mainstay in Solomun's performances. This and subsequent releases, such as those on Moda Black and Pets Recordings, have set the stage for a diverse range of sounds from the pair.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, Walker & Royce's music has been supported by Sasha, option4, Maceo Plex, Pete Tong, Need & Necessity, Catz N Dogz, Danny Daze, Tensnake, Jaymo & Andy George, Maxxi Soundsystem, Hector Romero, Jozif, Kolombo, Treasure Fingers, and Waifs & Strays, to name a few.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/01/11/57-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/walkerroyce\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/WalkerAndRoyce\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"WalkerAndRoyce\"},{\"id\":1140323,\"name\":\"Chris Kennedy\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://chriskennedymusic.org/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/DJChrisKennedy\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ustreetmusichall.com/event/1295931?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
