Four years younger, Jack continued in junior high, then high school \u2014 while playing professional gigs as lead guitarist at night before he was old enough to drive \u2014 while Jorma (who had played rhythm guitar to Jack\u2019s lead) started college in Ohio, accompanied his family overseas, then returned to college, this time in California.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the way, Jorma became enamored of, then committed to, the finger-picking guitar style exemplified by the now-legendary Rev. Gary Davis. Jack, meanwhile, had taken an interest in the electric bass, at the time a controversial instrument in blues, jazz, and folk circles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid 1960s, Jorma was asked to audition to play guitar for a new band that was forming in San Francisco. Though an acoustic player at heart, he grew interested in the electronic gadgetry that was beginning to make an appearance in the popular music scene \u2014 particularly in a primitive processor brought to the audition by a fellow named Ken Kesey \u2014 and decided to join that band; soon thereafter he summoned his young friend from Washington, who now played the bass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus was created the unique (then and now) sound that was The Jefferson Airplane. Jorma even contributed the band\u2019s name, drawn from a nickname a friend had for the blues-playing Jorma. Jack\u2019s experience as a lead guitarist led to a style of bass playing which took the instrument far beyond its traditional role.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile in The Jefferson Airplane, putting together the soundtrack of the 60s, the pair remained loyal to the blues, jazz, bluegrass, and folk influences of the small clubs and larger venues they had learned from years before. While in San Francisco and even in hotel rooms on the road, they would play together and worked up a set of songs that they would often play at clubs in the Bay Area and while on the road, often after having played a set with the Airplane. This led to a record contract; in fact, they had an album recorded before they decided to name their band Hot Tuna. With it they launched on an odyssey which has itself continued for more than 35 years, always finding new and interesting turns in its path forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing an early Hot Tuna fans discovered at their concerts of the early 1970s was that the band was growing louder and louder. In an era in which volume often overtrumped musicianship, Hot Tuna provided both. The second thing a fan would discover was that Jack and Jorma really loved to play. \u201cLook around for another band that plays uninterrupted three- to six-hour sets,\u201d wrote reviewer Jerry Moore. What Moore could not have known was that had there been no audience at all, they would have played just as long and just as well, so devoted were they to making music. Of course, the audience wasn\u2019t superfluous by any means; it energized and continues to energize their performances. Album followed album \u2014 more than two dozen in all, not counting solo efforts, side projects, and appearances on the albums of other bands and performers \u2014 and they continued to develop their interests and styles, both together and in individual pursuits. In an era in which old bands reunite for one last tour, Hot Tuna can\u2019t because Hot Tuna never broke up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the way, they have been joined by a succession of talented musicians: Drummers, harmonica players, keyboardists, backup singers, violinists, mandolinists, and more, all fitting in to Jorma and Jack\u2019s current place in the musical spectrum. And along the way there was no list of outstanding guitarists that didn\u2019t include Jorma, nor was there anyone who seriously thought there is a better bass player than Jack.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter two decades of acoustic and electric concerts and albums, the 1990s brought a new focus on acoustic music to Hot Tuna. More intimate venues with a more individual connection to the audience became increasingly frequent stops. Soon, the loud electric sound (and the semi trailer load of equipment) disappeared entirely from Hot Tuna tours. Maturity brought the desire to do things not instead of but in addition to being a touring band. Both had become interested in teaching, passing along what they had learned and what they had uniquely developed to a new generation of players.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998 Jorma and his wife Vanessa opened Fur Peace Ranch Guitar Camp, in the beautiful rolling Appalachian foothills of southeastern Ohio.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, on a sprawling and rustic yet modern campus, musicians and would-be musicians come for intensive and enjoyable workshops taught by Jorma, Jack, and other extraordinary players, learning things that range from different styles of playing to songwriting and even storytelling (the musician in performance has to say something while changing that broken string!), to making a song one\u2019s own.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, there is now BreakDownWay.com, a unique interactive teaching site that comes closest of anything yet to make individual instruction available to students anywhere there is a computer and an Internet connection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the teaching doesn\u2019t replace Hot Tuna\u2019s busy tour schedule; it\u2019s in addition to the tours. Nor have they lighened up their individual schedules. Jack released his first solo CD, Dream Factor, on Eagle Records in 2003. He has a busy and elaborate website at jackcasady.com. Jorma has a website, too, and achieved enormous critical acclaim and a Grammy nomination for his 2003 solo album, Blue Country Heart. (Both are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame due to their pioneering work in The Jefferson Airplane.) As 2006 began, they launched another exciting website, Hot Tuna Tunes, where fans may inexpensively download professionally made recordings of full Hot Tuna concerts in both MP3 and lossless encodings, suitable for portable player and home-burned CDs respectively. Hot Tuna Tunes is added to all the time, so it\u2019s almost as if Hot Tuna were releasing numerous live concert albums every year. Collect the entire set!\\r\\n\\r\\nJorma and Jack certainly could not have imagined, let alone predicted, where playing would take them. It\u2019s been a long and fascinating road to numerous exciting destinations. Two things have never changed: They still love to play as much as they did as kids in Washington D.C., and there are still many, many exciting miles yet to travel on their musical odyssey.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":661},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":207},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":138},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1410},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":69},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":344},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":447},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/57/81-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"DvAQD2WtFac\",\"title\":\"Invitation - Hot Tuna (America's Choice)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DvAQD2WtFac\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DvAQD2WtFac\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.hottuna.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/HotTunaBand\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"HotTunaBand\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.aladdin-theater.com/event/1382230?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
