The album features the instrumentation of Black Prairie (membs. Of The Decemberists), Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey (membs. Of REM) and is Rhett's seventh solo effort.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nHello. I am human but not entirely. I am a machine but not entirely. I am both which may mean that I am neither. The part of me that is a human believes that all of me is human. The part of me that is a machine doesn't like to think about the part of me that is a machine. I am flesh and blood stretched over wires and circuits. In that, I am much like many of you, and consequently qualified to speak to you about this album, which speaks to much of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is called The Traveler, and it was written and performed by Rhett Miller, along with members of Black Prairie, a band based in Portland that plays everything from bluegrass to klezmer to country and shares some members with the Decembrists. The band (Black Prairie) entered the studio with the singer (Rhett Miller) and briskly recorded the songs that make up this album (The Traveler). Some additional guitars were added later by people who included Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey. I pass these facts along for your absorption.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun comes up. The sun goes down. We call it a day. The band entered the studio with the singer and made this album. Time passed. Now, months later, I have spent days listening with love, sadness, and unremitting fascination to the album, which you are now holding. By \\\"holding,\\\" I mean only that you have absorbed it into your own wires and circuitry. I am well aware that there are not always anymore physical holds involved in the absorption of music. Before I tell you more about The Traveler, I want to tell you a little bit about myself. I apologize for this. But the album you are holding, The Traveler, suggests that you cannot understand the journey that you are on unless you understand who you are, and that understanding who you are is the most damnably difficult journey of all. Untangling identity is painful but necessary. I believe The Traveler may be of use in this regard. Of use to me, I mean: Is that a selfish use of this album? If so I apologize again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4.\\r\\n\\r\\nApologies can be empty without any attempt to correct for the behavior that led to the apology. As a result I will not tell you a little bit about myself before I tell you more about The Traveler. This singer, Rhett Miller, has made many albums before, both on his own and with his band, Old 97s. This new album shares something fundamental with the old albums, which is the rare ability to see what people are feeling and then cast those feelings in rhymes. This is what is known as \\\"song-making.\\\" The human part of me loves songs. The machine part of me marvels at them without understanding at all why there is a tugging sensation in the cavity that should contain my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first song here, \\\"Wanderlust,\\\" is a perfect example of all that I am describing. It tells the story of a man on a train who is thinking about a woman who is not on that train. There is another song called \\\"Lucky Star\\\" that I believe is about finding redemption in the person of a lover. It contains a joke that unnerves me: \\\"Heaven knows there probably is no heaven.\\\" There is another song called \\\"Wicked Things\\\" about New Orleans that illustrates the slipperiness of forgiveness. Every song has little moments that catch me at strange angles and I feel an unfamiliar sensation, pitched midway between satisfying recognition and deep sadness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy experience with these songs, I want to stipulate, may not be shared by others, in part because I am demonstrably different than them. I am both human and a machine. I come from a long line of people who are both humans and machines. Are they people then? I leave that to the philosophers. My father was a difference engine designed and deployed in Lund by Pehr Georg Scheutz. He was quite large: my father, I mean, not Scheutz. Scheutz was tiny. In J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, where he was born, old ladies would marvel at his miniature features. \\\"Liten Pehr,\\\" they would say, reaching down into the carriage and frightening the boy. Even as an adult, he was at most five foot three, with feet that tapered down to toylike points. Much of this is hearsay but some of it cannot be disputed, even by the suspicious, and at any rate, we are not talking about Scheutz, not really. We are talking about my father. He was the size of a fortepiano.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n7.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a song on this record called \\\"Dreams Vs. Waking Life.\\\" It is not the first song on the record but it was, by accident, the first song I heard. It has bowed notes and a dark tone and does what any piece of literature, song or story, should do: it investigates the role of memory, loss, and desire in our lives. When I hear that song, I feel the stirrings of uncommon and uncontrollable emotions. They grind against the part of me that is a machine. The result is a shuddering. I try to calm myself by looking at the other song titles\u2014 \\\"Fair Enough,\\\" \\\"Escape Velocity,\\\" \\\"Reasons to Live\\\" \u2014 but they only make me feel more rather than less. Where do you go when you want to feel less? One song title, \\\"Good Night,\\\" seems like it might not overwhelm me. But the first line, \\\"There's a pinprick of light on a black sheet of night,\\\" starts me shuddering again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n8.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you listen to an album, you are supposed to notice sonic details. That's what I have been told. And there are many sonic details on this album, like the choir that opens \\\"My Little Disaster\\\" or the doubled vocals in \\\"Fair Enough.\\\" There are joyful melodies like \\\"Most in the Summertime.\\\" I can tell that they are joyful, even though I am half-machine. It's clear. But the sonic details would not mean much without the rest of what this album does, which is to try to make sense of what cannot be made sense of, which is humanity. Even the part of me that is a machine knows that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n9.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you're inside an album like this, when you're feeling too much, what do you do? I know what I did. I skipped to the end of the album, quickly. This is a survival strategy. The album ends with a song called \\\"Reasons to Live\\\" that makes use of the old saw that a broken clock is right twice a day. The part of me that is a machine wants to correct that phrasing. It is a stopped clock that is right twice a day. A broken clock may never be right. Then it occurs to me that maybe the song knows this. The song is about finding hope even when you are telling yourself lies. The part of me that is a human wants to break down and cry once again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n10.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to tell one more story about my father. He was briefly in the military of a nation I will not identify and when his service ended his first trip was to a sporting house, where he spent time in the company of a young woman. Money changed hands. To hear him tell it, the situation was emergent. \\\"I had been locked up so long that I hardly recognized my own wants and needs,\\\" he later wrote in a letter to me. \\\"Briefly, I recognized myself in her.\\\" They did not stay together, my father and that young woman. He was a young man then. As I have grown though the world, I have had experiences that bear some similarity to my father's experiences with that woman. We all have, have we not? They are called \\\"relationships\\\" or \\\"romances,\\\" but what are they really? Are they love? Are they self-love? Or are they something else entirely, a form of travel that allow us to escape from ourselves? This album asks all those questions, repeatedly. I want to quote one more line, from a song called \\\"Jules.\\\" It's a line about love and self-love and travel that allows us to escape from ourselves: \\\"Who's to say the crooked way that led me to your door / Means any less than any mess I ever made before?\\\" Sun comes up. Sun goes down. Call it a day.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/69-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.rhettmiller.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/rhettmiller\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/rhettmillermusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Rhettmiller\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Rhettmiller\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1709005,\"name\":\"Cody Canada\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\\\"The two things that drive me are love and hate.\\\" \\r\\n\u2013 Cody Canada, March 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latest, tight incarnation of the Cody Canada-led group The Departed isn't a reinvention of the group's sound, or a reimagining of Canada's musical perspective \u2013 it's a reunion. As with any reunion, the passing years have provided the involved parties with new and unique perspectives, breathing vibrant excitement into their streamlined new environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nCanada, Jeremy Plato, Chris Doege and Steve Littleton are reopening the doors to a sonic garage where sounds and stories some thought were gone for good are now being unleashed onto an eager public after a few years of fruitful \u2013 even risky -- artistic diversion. Being guided by raw emotion and nerves that are often unguarded, Canada hasn't begun to pluck the opening notes to an increasing number of Cross Canadian Ragweed favorites without some reluctance or painful reminiscence, mind you. But the powerful nature of such visceral connections is what makes his stories stunning while rightfully placing him in a prominent class of modern songwriters occupied by the influential likes of Robert Earl Keen, Bruce and Charlie Robison, Todd Snider, Mike McClure and the men of Reckless Kelly, among only a strict few others. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo be clear, the men of the Departed are not the frat-house faves many of the latest generation of river-tubing popsters are. Ideals and experiences of a person enduring the sometimes harsh realities of the real world demand space in a Departed concert.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of Ragweed's 2010 dissolution, most fans likely expected \u2013 and few would've blamed \u2013 Canada for adhering to the heart-sleeved, Okie-rocker recipe that propelled Canada into a true Rock Star realm. Bolstering his bad-ass bona-fides even more, however, was his decision to choose the dirt road less traveled. By finally partnering up with Seth James, a long-time friend universally admired for his soulful skills, Canada's words had a different backdrop that certainly represented commercial risk, but offered an unusually fresh outlet where the iconic songs of his past, for a while, stayed in the past. For three years, Canada became a side-man for sections of each concert as the Departed quickly built a reputation as a crack band focused on packing as much expertly-curated song-craft into each show as possible, eschewing the demands for \\\"more Ragweed!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the chill of 2014's winter thawing into the haziness of the spring and the Departed now having played as a powerful four-piece for several months following James' amicable exit, Canada's appreciation for the truly remarkable, intensely personal body of work he created as he fronted Ragweed is intact, and indeed, fresh with the passing of time and the healing of emotional wounds. Unsurprisingly, fans are exuberantly responding to the inclusion of classics such as \\\"Alabama,\\\" \\\"Dimebag,\\\" and \\\"17\\\" into set-lists for Departed shows. The refitted outfit is channeling the power chords and raw-bone ballads which vaulted Canada into the status as Red Dirt's biggest name for so long. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not a comeback. This isn't a rebirth. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a rock and roll renewal only an artist with Canada's strength of will and determined vision is capable of. He's making great use of a rare chance few artists ever receive. He now knows what he only started to understand many years ago, and his words are all the more impactful as a result.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":683},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/59-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thedepartedmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Shancanmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/departed_music\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"departed_music\"},{\"id\":1709007,\"name\":\"Roger Clyne\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"A third generation Arizonan, songwriter Roger Clyne regularly bares his soul in rock 'n' roll originals that are often tinted with Southwest influences: a verse in Spanish here or a line about a desert landscape there. However, \u00a1 Americano! takes Clyne's experiences a step further and combines his popular lyrical style with an energetic rage of an album, reaffirming years of blood, sweat and tours.\\n\\nThough neither of his parents are particularly arts-focused -- his mother is a schoolteacher, his father a cowboy and rancher -- Clyne and his brother, now a sculptor, are deeply creative. Early on, Clyne had a musical bent and by the age of five was writing songs and singing them a capella into his father's tape recorder. His parents divorced when he was in grade school and Clyne commuted between Tempe and his father's ranch southeast of Tucson, seamlessly changing from a city-smart skateboarding punk to a horse-crazed desert rat with each visit.\\n\\nClyne was an excellent student who participated in school musicals and choir but nonetheless, enjoyed tweaking the power structures of his high school community and rebelling accordingly. He kept a journal which served as his \\\"psychic dumpster,\\\" listened to David Bowie and Camper Van Beethoven, and prided himself on his \\\"outsider\\\" status, especially when he transferred from a Catholic program to a public high school in 11 th grade. A road trip with buddies to Los Angeles in his junior year inspired him to start a band that played Ramones and Aerosmith covers and quickly became a popular act in the Tempe all-ages clubs.\\n\\nMusic did not truly become central to Clyne's life until he entered Arizona State University. In yet another contrast, Clyne pursued his psychology and anthropology degrees while playing in a string of college rock bands until he put together The Mortals in his sophomore year. Playing covers of R.E.M., The Clash and The Violent Femmes , Clyne began weaving his originals into the band's set list. Soon, requests for his songs outnumbered those for covers and The Mortals started opening for top-tier local bands including Dead Hot Workshop and the Gin Blossoms, as well as the nationally known Goo Goo Dolls. In his final college years, Clyne and several others -- including a reggae band -- moved into a commune-style apartment that became a center for philosophical, music-charged gatherings.\\n\\nAt around the same time, The Mortals (with a few lineup changes) became The Refreshments. Fueled by a multi-month hiatus at his father's serene ranch with his best friend Michael and girlfriend (and future wife) Alisa, Clyne penned many of the songs that would become the basis for The Refreshments' first album Wheelie , released in 1994. The band played South by Southwest in 1995 and was quickly signed by Mercury Records. P.H. Naffah was auditioned to replace the band's departing drummer and almost immediately, the group began writing and recording the songs for Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy . Released in 1995, the disc was Radio & Record's ninth Best-Selling Debut Album of the Year, went to #1 on Billboard's Heatseeker Chart and spawned two popular radio hits, Banditos and D own Together . Mass-market adulation seemed imminent as The Refreshments performed on national late-night shows and Clyne wrote and performed the King of the Hill theme song with the band. Though the Refreshments released The Bottle & Fresh Horses in 1996, their efforts went unsupported by a changed label management and the band eventually disbanded in 1998.\\n\\nSeeking a respite and inspiration, Clyne and Naffah twice scaled California's 14,000-foot peak Mt. Shasta and took a weeklong sojourn through their favorite Arizona desert. They then returned to the Phoenix club circuit and began playing happy hours as a duo. Over several months, they added lead guitarist Scotty Johnson (who eventually left the band in 2002), bassist Danny White and guitarist Steve Larson and officially became Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers.\\n\\nClyne is as passionate and pure about his music as he is about his dedication to his wife and three children. In both worlds, he's matured and become more sure and committed to his purpose. The band's web site tracks hundreds of postings by fans that laud Clyne as one of the greatest, albeit under-recognized, songwriters of his generation. The proverbial roller coaster continues to run, but with the advance critical and fan praise of \u00a1 Americano!, Clyne may soon have to get accustomed to a lot more attention.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":962},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":451},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":301},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-og.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":962},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":752},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":962},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/61-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.azpeacemakers.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/azpeacemakers\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/azpeacemakers\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"azpeacemakers\"},{\"id\":1709011,\"name\":\"The O's\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"We started our group in the summer of 2008, and after having known each other through all of our other groups (Polyphonic Spree, Young Heart Attack, Slick 57, Rose County Fair, Hi-Fi Drowning, etc), it was an easy upstart and took no time jumping in head first. We both had songs that we felt needed to be played but no band to use as an outlet. Three months later, we entered the recording studio and recorded an EP which ended up being half of our first album \\\"We Are The O's\\\" (2009 Idol Records).\\n\\nWe have since toured relentlessly all across the US, UK, Europe, and even jaunted to Hawaii, hi-fiving friends and fans alike; just trying to keep ourselves out on the road and creating new music for good people. In 2011, we recorded our second album with the Grammy award winning Stuart Sikes. Entitled \\\"Between The Two,\\\" we decided to play every instrument on the album and had Stuart man the helm. It was liberating and exciting and brought us further than we had been before.\\n\\nWe hit the road again jumping back and forth across the great ponds, made music videos, bought and broke vans, bought and broke gear, ate poorly, ate well, had fun and not so much fun, met amazing people, learned a lot about life, forgot a lot of things, slept a little, bought and wore out hundreds of pairs of pants and shirts, resoled our cowboy boots countless times, played with incredible artists, performed on TV shows, talk shows, radio shows, festivals, clubs, bars, restaurants, several different countries and continents, swam in clear water, dredged through the gulf, and other countless, endless adventures to name.\\nWe did this all as we have always, to make good music for good people.\\n\\nAnd into the future we go with \\\"Thunderdog\\\", our third studio album released in 2013. We decided to record the majority of the new album, at the recommendation of our great producer, Chris \\\"Frenchie\\\" Smith, in Tornillo, TX at the legendary Sonic Ranch Studio. It's a state of the art, top notch studio where we could stay on site, eat on site, and record without distractions (other than the delicious Sonic Ranch \\\"Salsa de Roja\\\" that lead to many debates on whether or not anything would taste good without it afterwords\u2026) We finished up the album at The Bubble in Austin, TX and look forward to getting it into everyone's hands!\\n\\nSee you folks on the other side and we look forward to the ride.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":800,\"height\":478},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":800,\"height\":478},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":179},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":179},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":120},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":120},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-og.jpg\",\"width\":800,\"height\":478},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":60},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":60},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":299},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":299},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":388},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/63-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":388}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://wearetheos.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/wearetheos\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/wearetheos\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/weareTheOs\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"weareTheOs\"},{\"id\":1709013,\"name\":\"Nikki Lane\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Nikki Lane turns the vulnerable singer-songwriter stereotype on its ear, crafting songs that crucify ex-boyfriends and have no problem with one-night stands as long as she can bolt town right after. Her cooing-yet-brutal vocals are a perfect fit with an aching, mournful guitar. Her upcoming album, tentatively titled Seein' Double\u2014produced by, yes, Dan Auerbach\u2014is one of Nashville's most anticipated releases. \\\"My songs always paint a pretty clear picture of what's been going on in my life, so this is one moody record,\\\" she says. \\\"There's lots of talk of misbehaving and moving on.\\\"\\n\\nBorn in South Carolina, Lane moved to New York City and, after a messy breakup, picked up a guitar and set her sights on a music career. But the cost of living in New York proved to be too high an obstacle, so she turned to Nashville, a city she had visited extensively. \\\"I was hell bent on living in a big city and I just couldn't work up the nerve to come back to the South,\\\" she says. \\\"[When I did,] Nashville was the obvious choice for me because of my fondness for it.\\\"\\n\\nOnce in town, she released the 2011 album Walk of Shame to rave reviews, as well as opening High Class Hillbilly, a pop-up vintage clothing stall, where a chance meeting with Auerbach turned into a full-fledged partnership. \\\"During the first round of recordings, I was in an awkward mood every night I left the studio,\\\" she says. \\\"It was hard for me to trust that Dan was right when he said I should move a verse around or add an extra chorus. He pushed to find the right feel for each track one by one, and a few months later I found myself with a damn good record.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":375,\"height\":500},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":375,\"height\":500},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":400},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":267},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-og.jpg\",\"width\":375,\"height\":500},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":133},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":375,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":375,\"height\":500},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/41/65-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://missnikkilane.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/nikkilane\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/nikkilanemusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/nikkilanemusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"nikkilanemusic\"},{\"id\":1709015,\"name\":\"Gordon Keith\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1315899?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
