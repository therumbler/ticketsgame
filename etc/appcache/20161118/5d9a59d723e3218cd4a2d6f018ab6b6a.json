Indeed, in the fourteen years since Bowen launched his career at Stubb\u2019s Barbecue in Lubbock, Texas, he\u2019s risen from collegiate greenhorn to the top of the Texas music and Red Dirt circuit. His colleagues and friends Pat Green, Jack Ingram, Eli Young Band and others had made the major-label leap, helping to take a vibrant regional sound to the rest of America. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Bowen is poised to bring that Red Dirt and independent spirit to country music at large. Wade\u2019s baritone is dense and concentrated, with traces of whisky and smoke and an autumnal warmth. Bowen takes command of his songs, cutting over the top of producer Justin Niebank\u2019s sculpted guitar-scapes on his latest release \\\"The Given.\\\" The sound is one hundred percent country, rife with pedal steel and vivid emotion, but it\u2019s also music that could easily find a home with fans of Bowen\u2019s rock idols \u2013 folks like Bruce Springsteen and Jackson Browne. Take a few passes through this project and you\u2019ll hearing a singer\u2019s singer and a focused songwriter who\u2019s adding layers to his music all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a live circuit where the overwhelming mandate is to stir up a party, Bowen has aimed to leave folks with a memory. As a writer, even one from a state with some tall literary traditions, he\u2019s not trying to earn a PhD in poetry; he\u2019s trying to communicate. \u201cMy style,\u201d he says, \u201cis more to try to evoke an emotion. I\u2019m more about trying to leave a mark on people.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing up in Waco, Bowen\u2019s exposure to the music of Texas was limited to whatever made it on FM country radio. George Strait was king. Guy Clark was a name he\u2019d not have recognized before getting to college. But at school, in Lubbock, he discovered the full spectrum of Texas artistry, starting with Robert Earl Keen. \u201cHe was a big changing point in my life,\u201d says Wade. \u201cI realized by listening to him that there was way more out there than I ever knew. So I started getting into Guy Clark and other great Texas music. But I was obsessed with Robert Earl. When we started the band we were sort of a Robert Earl cover band.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat band was called West 84, and they found that with their large posse of friends who\u2019d always show up for a good time, it was easy to land gigs. Bowen meanwhile began to channel a lifelong love of writing into songs, and when college ended he made two major decisions. He took on the role of solo artist, and he moved to Austin. By then, about 2001, fellow Waco native Pat Green had busted out to national prominence and the Texas music phenomenon was the buzz of Nashville. It was part of Wade Bowen\u2019s inspiration to charge ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nTry Not To Listen is the album Wade regards as his true debut, the project that kicked off a life and living made of 200-plus nights a year on the road and patient grassroots fan development. Then with Lost Hotel in 2006, things really began to click. The opening track \u201cGod Bless This Town\u201d reached No. 1 on the bellwether Texas Music Chart, and to date, Bowen has had a total of 10 Number 1's and 15 Top 5 Singles on the Texas Music Chart. He achieved another landmark in 2010, when he was invited to add his name to the roster of great artists who\u2019ve made a Live At Billy Bob\u2019s CD/DVD combo at the iconic club in Fort Worth. \\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.wadebowen.com/Across five independent albums and a decade-plus of touring, Wade Bowen has amassed a string of regional hits and awards, and also a fan base who is passionate about music.
