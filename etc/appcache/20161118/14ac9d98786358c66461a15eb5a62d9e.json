As one of the U.S.'s original proponents of breakbeat music, AK started DJing in 1989, playing electro and other beat friendly music of that time. In 1990, he opened a record store in his hometown of Orlando, FL called The Hottie Shoppe, where he began developing relationships with burgeoning breakbeat labels such as Suburban Base and Moving Shadow. Via these early relationships, he quickly became known in the UK as someone who could spread the message in America, and by 1991, he was writing articles and reviews in the classic US Rave. Around this same time, Dave Minner also gained his moniker as AK1200 when fellow Floridian DJ Icey noticed the hyped-up BPM's of the tunes Dave would play in The Hottie Shop, and said \\\"You're playing so fast that you are like an AK on the 1200's!\\\" Icey started throwing raves at The Edge and he would put \\\"Dave AK1200 Minner\\\" on the flyer. The name stuck ever since.\\n\\nFor the next few years, AK headlined the second room of countless parties throughout the US, continuing to make a name for himself. As Jungle music evolved and became more popular, so did AK1200. Also in 93, he was invited to the UK again, this time to DJ, and played alongside such greats as Hype, Mickey Finn, Swift and Zinc, Danny Breaks, SL2, and several others for a Christmas party for Suburban Base Recordings. AK was also the first American to play on the UK's pirate radio, playing alongside Swift and Zinc on Format FM. Back home in the US, Jungle was beginning to finally get its due, though still hated-on by many of the nations party promoters, it was too big to be ignored.\\n\\nAt this point there were literally tons of US jungle DJ's coming up, and AK searching for something different, found a great appreciation for the lighter side of jungle championed by labels such as Timeless & Good Looking, which became known as Drum and Bass. AK found light in the soulful sounds of musical Drum and Bass, and began opening or closing for people like Sasha and Digweed in the main rooms of many raves and clubs across the US.\\n\\nSlowly over the later half of the 90's, AK1200 again enhanced his sound and style, giving his fans a smooth transition to the rawest, most aggressive sounds of the time. By constantly touring nationwide, releasing 4 very highly received mix CD's on the Moonshine label, remixing many acts such as The Crystal Method, Rabbit in the Moon, A Tribe Called Quest, Dub Pistols, Keoki, Cirrus, & Freestyle, AK1200 was regarded as one of a very small handful of DJ's to truly conquer the scene in America.\\n\\nMore recently, AK and longtime colleagues Dieselboy and Dara came to realize that they on their own had become the top three dnb DJ's in the US, so what would happen if they joined forces? The answer of course, was world domination, and the Planet of the Drums (POTD) crew was born.\\n\\nAt this time, AK also signed with Lakeshore - :\\\\run recordings, and began work on his most adventurous project to date: a full length studio album\ufffd\\n\\nTHE PRESENT:\\n\\nTwo years in the making, \\\"SHOOTTOKILL\\\" marks the debut studio album from AK1200. \\\"I felt that I have gone practically as far as one can go as a DJ. I have always been interested in production, and thought it was the right time for an artist album- it was the next logical step for me. I have so many influences musically that you can't really express as just a DJ, and the songs on the album reflect who I am creatively without the limits of what I have to play as a DJ,\\\" states AK. Not wanting to simply make an album reflecting whatever the current sound of the moment is in drum and bass, AK chose to make an album that embodies the history of the sound \ufffd which is, in fact, his own history.\\n\\n\\\"SHOOTTOKILL\\\" moves with ease through the many styles of this very diverse form of music, from the opening modern ragga track \\\"Junior's Tune\\\" featuring legendary reggae vocalist Junior Reid of Black Uhuru to the MASSVIE vocal stormer \\\"Fake\\\" feat. Terra Deva (the album's lead single), to the chill dnb sounds of \\\"Deja Nu\\\". Another strong thread throughout the album is the sound of Florida. All the songs on SHOOTTOKILL are anchored with a sonic quality and songwriting level that, no matter what the country of origin and no matter what genre classification, is impressive.\\n\\nTHE FUTURE:\\n\\nThe future for AK1200 is becoming a reality rather quickly. Plans for his own artist imprint via Lakeshore - :\\\\run recordings are being solidified now, and POTD members AK, Dieselboy, Dara and newly inducted MC J-Messinian have already planned on a studio collaboration before the years end. The incessant touring will of course continue as POTD is steadily proving that they are as much of a draw as any top name superstar DJ. As drum and bass and electronic music as a whole both expands and matures, AK1200 plans to be there leading the charge for the breakbeat massive at every step of the way.\\n\\n'Nuff respect.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":150},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":150},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":150},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":150},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":150},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-og.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":150},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":150},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":150},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":150},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/71/89-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":150,\"height\":150}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.ak1200.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/1232282\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/AK1200official\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ak1200\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ak1200\"},{\"id\":225683,\"name\":\"Evol Intent\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The turn of the century has seen many incredible innovations in the production and development of drum n' bass. Over the past five years the genre has been broken, recast, and mutated into perhaps the most aggressive and visceral manifestation of music today. The Atlanta-based artists Evol Intent are among the greatest purveyors of this incendiary, modern jungle sound. Operating as a three piece power troop, Knick, Gigantor and the Enemy have produced some of the most ephemeral and progressive drum n' bass to date. The outfit's uncompromising and inimitable drum tirades left an indelible mark on the U.S. scene and the globe at large. Birthed out of hardcore-punk culture, the trio developed a unique method for wrecking soundsystems. The Evol Intent approach is unmistakable: combine dynamic drum mechanics, razor sharp edits, sawtooth synths and an element of discord resonant of their punk youth. In a very short period of time the group has amassed a substantial discography while recording for their own Evol Intent label as well as numerous prestigious imprints such as Renegade Hardware, Outbreak, and Human.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving begun Evol Intent Recordings in 2000, Knick and Gigantor were determined to create a conduit suitable for their own productions as well as those by friends and like-minded producers. The Enemy joined ranks shortly after, via the internet, and eventually relocated to contribute to the growing movement. Armed with several releases, a host of regional performances, and recognition by acclaimed publications, the next level of success was but an imminent conquest. Tracks like \\\"Seven Angels for Seven Plagues\\\", \\\"Red Soil\\\", and \\\"Where's the Score\\\" remix  began generating serious buzz on the dubplate circuit; in turn garnering the affection of bona fide artists like Technical Itch and Dylan and the esteemed Trouble On Vinyl music group. With Evol Intent Recrodings' acquisition of world wide distribution (initially via Alpha Magic), a high exposure 12\u2033 release on Outbreak, and signing to the exalted Renegade Hardware, the group's incredible progression was unparalleled. Releases on the TOV sub-label, Barcode, and a remix of the Future Cut anthem, \\\"Ghetto Style\\\", furthered the crew's burgeoning development. With a compelling amount of quality releases and respect from the media, the trio took their gospel to nearly every corner of the globe. Extensive worldwide touring from Atlanta to Australia embedded the Evol Intent doctrine into the ears and soundsystems across dozens of nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word on Evol Intent was spreading and caught the attention of Dieselboy who requested their skills for his acclaimed \\\"Dungeon Master's Guide\\\" compilation, remixing a track from the world-renowned BT. Their 2005 \\\"Us Against the World\\\" mix CD and tour have given rise to numerous developments and further collaborations particularly with barcode label mate Ewun. With the assistance of LOAD Media, Evol Intent Recordings released new material by Mumblz, Arsenic, and Counterstrike and will also feature remix treatment courtesy of techstep stalwart Technical Itch and Milwaukee based phenoms Gein. One short year later saw the guys release the \\\"Police Sate EP\\\" which went on to be one of the best-selling EPs by an American drum n' bass producer. Despite all these advances, Evol Intent were not content following a straight path and in an effort to branch out into different artistic releases they produced tracks for video games like the coveted EA Sports' \\\"Need for Speed\\\" and Adult Swim promo adds.\\r\\nHaving achieved a degree of accomplishment approaching pinnacle proportions, Evol Intent sees no intention of resting or becoming complacent and went full force into 2007. This past year saw them reunite with friend Dieselboy for his 'Human Resource' release titled \\\"Evol Intent Assemble the Monster\\\", featuring tracks that were re-edited, mashed-up and glitched. They also solidified other partnerships, this time with fellow producers Chris Renegade, Ewun, Apex and Spor to create the imprint Lifted Music. \\\"Glock Party\\\", Evol Intent's contribution to the label's inaugural release \\\"The Prologue EP\\\" became an undeniable underground smash-a track that Goldie has been spinning all over the world and boldly states that \\\"the reaction has been mental.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the future, Evol Intent will be releasing their highly anticipated debut artist LP \\\"Era of Diversion\\\" which features the trio's signature hardcore drum n' bass sound, but the album will many surprises in store for fans, as it traverses different genres and styles. Breaking the mold and experimenting with other genres is extremely important to Evol Intent's evolution which is why they also have side projects that afford each member an extra creative outlet. Knick has partnered with fellow drum n' bass producers Mayhem and Ewun to form the breaks outfit Hostage and downtempo project Minus Music, respectively. The Enemy is working with many of Atlanta's elite MCs producing hip hop beats and produces electro bangers under the name Treasure Fingers. And Gigantor has been working behind the scenes for many Southeastern acts doing mixdowns and engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderground superstardom may well be an understatement, but the importance of Evol Intent in contemporary drum n' bass is simply undeniable. Beats that think, beats that hurt\u2026. Evol Intent beats nonetheless\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/16/41/77-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":342},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/16/41/77-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/16/41/77-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":228},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/16/41/77-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/16/41/77-og.jpg\",\"width\":899,\"height\":1024},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/16/41/77-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":114},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/16/41/77-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/16/41/77-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/16/41/77-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/16/41/77-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":456},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/16/41/77-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.evolintent.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/realevolintent\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Evol_Intent\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Evol_Intent\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ustreetmusichall.com/event/1368545?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
