It\u2019s the road. And if multiple Blues Music Award winner Mike Zito had a dollar for every mile of tarmac he\u2019s burnt since his breakout in the early-\u201990s, they\u2019d be piled up to his chin. \u201cThere\u2019s just something in me,\u201d considers the solo bandleader and Royal Southern Brotherhood co-founder (with Devon Allman and Cyril Neville), \u201cIt\u2019s there in all musicians. You gotta love the road to be a part of this world. You\u2019re right there, looking in people\u2019s eyes, swapping stories, shaking hands\u2026\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\u2019s an undeniable romance about a life in motion \u2013 and an enduring magic about the moment when the house lights go down, the roar of the crowd goes up and the shadows take the stage. For Mike, who began touring the Midwest circuit at the age of eighteen, and has since crossed twenty-plus countries as guitarist with the Brotherhood, this is when things get serious. \u201cIn my band, The Wheel, if you\u2019re not already with us, you\u2019d better get on board,\u201d he grins. \u201cBecause otherwise we\u2019re gonna knock you down!\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nReleased in August 2014 in the US as the latest installment in Ruf Records\u2019 Award winning live series, Zito\u2019s Songs From The Road is a two-disc set that captures Mike at full throttle on his adopted home-turf. \u201cThis DVD and live album were recorded on January 10th, 2014, at Dosey Doe at The Woodlands, TX, to a sold-out crowd of crazy Texans,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe audience was on fire from the first note. The band played with such energy and passion. I was overwhelmed many times throughout this performance by the sheer energy of love that poured out of every soul in that building. It was a truly magical night, one I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMike Zito And The Wheel: Songs From The Road captures the push \u2018n\u2019 pull between Mike and his all-star lineup of Jimmy Carpenter (sax/vocals), Scot Sutherland (bass/vocals), Lewis Stephens (piano/organ) and Rob Lee (drums/percussion). \u201cWith the guys in The Wheel,\u201d explains the bandleader, \u201cwe\u2019re all on the same page. We\u2019re not interested in solos, we want to play together.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite-hot chemistry meets world-class material on Songs From The Road, whose set list dips into pivotal moments from Mike\u2019s storied past. There\u2019s Greyhound: the gritty travelogue recalling the desperate events of September 2002, when a drug-addicted Mike stole his father\u2019s credit card and bought a one-way bus ticket to Florida. \u201cI decided I\u2019d be doing everybody a favor if I just left, got as far away as I could go,\u201d he remembers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the emotional flipside, there\u2019s Rainbow Bridge, written about the rush that a reformed Mike felt on the final approach to home. \u201cThe Rainbow Bridge is one of the tallest bridges in the South,\u201d he explains. \u201cI would have to drive to Louisiana to play gigs, and then I\u2019d drive home over that Rainbow Bridge. And I knew that when I was hitting the bridge, I was almost home.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLongtime Zito fans in the Dosey Doe crowd would have been waiting for Pearl River: the song co-written by Mike and Cyril Neville in reference to civil rights campaigner Dick Gregory, which planted the seed for the Royal Southern Brotherhood. Likewise, the cheers are deafening for the title track of last year\u2019s Gone To Texas album. \u201cPart of the story of that song,\u201d he notes, \u201cis that historically, people go to Texas to get their lives together. And I did too.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue enough. Ask Mike for his backstory and he\u2019ll give you the cold, hard truth. In his own words, the bandleader \u201cgrew up poor in St. Louis\u201d; in a blue-collar family whose father logged 40-hour weeks at the local brewery. Ten years working at a downtown guitar shop, under the tutelage of an older employee, exposed him to titans like B.B. King, the Allmans and Eric Clapton (and from there, Joe Pass, Robert Johnson and Blind Willie Johnson), and though he was fired from early cover bands for refusing to mimic the solos, by 1997, he had released his debut album Blue Room. \u201cThe first time you hear yourself,\u201d recalls Mike, \u201cyou think, \u2018Wow, that almost sounds like music!\u2019\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were bumps in the road, of course. By the post-millennium, creeping alcoholism and drug abuse had threatened to rob Mike of his talent and livelihood. For a time, all seemed lost. But since the epiphany of meeting his beloved wife (\u201cI give her all the credit in the world\u201d), Mike has blossomed as both a man and musician, and in 2014, he can reflect on a run of thrilling solo albums, plus two universally renowned studio releases with the Brotherhood. \u201cIt\u2019s all working out,\u201d he beams, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t be more thankful.\u201d \u201cGone To Texas is an old slang expression for the man of the house has split,\u201d Zito says with a smirk, \u201cMy life now couldn\u2019t be further from that.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy, successful, surrounded by his loving family and juggling a fistful of celebrated projects, perhaps you\u2019d understand if Mike were content to rest on his laurels. Not a chance. In 2014, as Songs From The Road proves, that endless freeway is still a siren-call that this lifelong road-dog can\u2019t ignore. \u201cThe road is part of the story,\u201d he concludes, \u201cand that\u2019s why there are so many songs about it. When a tour ends, I can\u2019t wait to get home. But by the week after, I\u2019m itching to get back out there. It\u2019s like the song says, the road never ends.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1204},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":376},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":251},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-og.jpg\",\"width\":1632,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":125},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":627},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":816},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/72/82-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/mikezitomusic/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1770968,\"name\":\"Jim Suhler\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Jim Suhler and his band Monkey Beat have been on the music scene now for over twenty two years and have built a fanbase worldwide.
