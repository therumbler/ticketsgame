Emotive and unapologetically organic, their fluid approach unites more than a lifetime of influences. Their impressive live show, which features Paulus' inimitable trumpet and vocals alongside DeBruyn's masterful manipulation of the rhythm and soundscapes bridges the gap between the indie arena and the heartbeat of the dancefloor. Watch their set at Boiler Room Berlin. Greg Paulus and Nick DeBruyn met as 8 year olds growing up in St. Paul, Minnesota, bonding over an early mutual love of hip-hop and jazz legends such as A Tribe Called Quest, J Dilla, Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Herbie Hancock. This deep-rooted connection allows them to understand each other in a rare and profound way. Paulus performed trumpet at local jazz clubs in his teenage years and went on to study jazz/classical at the Manhattan School of Music. Together they later traveled to Cuba's Havana to study Afro-Cuban rhythm, music and culture. But the seeds of their evolution were really sewn in 2006 when they attended a Wolf + Lamb party in NYC that blew their minds. Thrown at the Marcy Hotel, a space featured in The Guardian newspaper it propelled DeBruyn to join Paulus in Brooklyn and begin experimenting with electronic music. They naturally formed a very close musical and personal relationship with Zev and Gadi of Wolf + Lamb and their first output, a deep and cerebral string of EPs, was released on the W+L label in 2008 alongside artists such as Soul Clap and Nicolas Jaar. No Regular Play became integral to the Wolf + Lamb family when they took up residence in the Marcy building, a melting pot for creative minds. This move allowed a more fluid approach to their productions and new collaborations were formed. Subsequent material from the duo has shown up on a slew of respected labels including No. 19 Music and Supplement Facts. Never to be tied to one breed or style, in 2012 they released the track \\\"Rain (All Day)\\\" on Cut Mistake Music, which was reconstructed and performed as a 25-minute piece by Paulus and his father for improvisation/ electronics with the Minnesota Orchestra. Greg Paulus has also released solo material on Double Standard Records and Wolf + Lamb, respectively. He has worked and toured with critically acclaimed indie band Beirut and, more recently, Matthew Dear's live band over the past two years. The duo still watches over the infamous Marcy Hotel, and tour regularly performing their incredible live sets at some of the world's most cutting-edge clubs. Fall 2012 saw the release of their debut album, \\\"Endangered Species\\\", on Wolf + Lamb Records.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":696,\"height\":1024},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":441},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":294},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-og.jpg\",\"width\":696,\"height\":1024},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":147},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":736},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":956},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/36/11-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/noregularplay\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/noregularplay\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/noregularplay\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"noregularplay\"},{\"id\":1768357,\"name\":\"Nick Monaco\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Inside this classically handsome, talented, and gregarious man exists a shy, awkward soul. But this introverted interior is the catalyst behind the upward trajectory of his career, which currently includes an impressive back catalogue of inventive, genre-defying club jams, a hectic tour schedule as a member of Crew Love, an accomplished debut album Mating Call and a captivating live show, which truly lays bare his vulnerable inner self with every performance.\\n\\nMaking links with the dirtybird crew initially and later, Soul Clap, helped to push Nick's career forward. It was having the creative freedom offered to him by Eli and Charlie's label, and Wolf + Lamb, that allowed him to flourish and focus on becoming the artist he'd always yearned to be; soulful, loose and free of genre constraints.\\n\\nYou never know who's going to answer when you come knocking on Monaco's door, it could be The Butterfly; na\u00efve, young, wide-eyed and innocent. The Stalker; a creepy, sex-addicted voyeur. The Maintenance Man; the man you call when you're in a jam. All of whom, and more, are components of Nick's real persona.\\n\\nThis colourful cast of characters appear on his very first album Mating Call, an adventurous project that incorporates Nick's own voice and live instrumentation, giving it a strong organic element built around a narrative theme. This is what his album and his sound ultimately represent: an ethos with no boundaries, as opposed to a strict regimented sound. \\n\\nThe door opens and he steps out of his dressing room, Vogueing his way to the stage. There's an infectious, positive energy and warmth flowing out of Nick \u2013 the costume, the lipstick, the personality\u2026 he's never been more ready for this adventure.
