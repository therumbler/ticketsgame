Mix 65 percent country music storytelling with 20 percent hip-hop attitude, add in 15 percent rock \u2018n\u2019 roll plus 100 percent hard work and you have a multi-format duo that defies definition and oozes opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duo, which is made up of hip-hop artist Clay \u201cUncle Snap\u201d Sharpe and lead vocalist/guitarist Brian \u201cRooster\u201d King, doesn\u2019t easily fit into any predetermined box and that\u2019s exactly why The LACS unique blend of music appeals to America\u2019s iPod generation. \u201cWhen we make a mix CD on our computer, we don\u2019t put together 30 songs that are straight country,\u201d explains Sharpe. \u201cWe might have 10 country, 10 rock and 10 rap songs. We knew our kind of people would like it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe LACS\u2019 unique blend of music is on full display on Keep It Redneck, the duo\u2019s latest release. \u201cOur music is not one dimensional,\u201d Sharpe says. \u201cWe take the good out of rock, the good out of country and the good out of rap and mix them together and create something different. We build from scratch.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn and raised in South Georgia, the pair met when King moved to Baxley, a rural town more famous for its sawmills and turpentine stills than its music scene. \u201cWe call Baxley a big town, but its just now got four lights,\u201d Sharpe says with a knowing laugh. \u201cWe got a Walmart a few years ago, so we\u2019re moving up.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a town with only four stoplights it\u2019s not hard to spot a stranger. \u201cI saw him riding around town and I didn\u2019t know him, so I just stopped him one day and said, \u2018who are you and what you got goin\u2019 on?\u2019\u201d Sharpe recalls of his first meeting with King. \u201cWe ended up hanging out that night. He pulled out the guitar and I did, too. We\u2019ve been making music together ever since.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe figured out we liked the same kind of music and our friendship just built from there,\u201d adds King. The pair quickly connected and began creating their musical legacy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey pooled their money and went into a local studio to record. \u201cWe knocked out 20 songs in three days,\u201d Sharpe says. \u201cEven the studio guys were surprised.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSharpe and King pressed the music onto CDs and, along with a few friends armed with CD players, began peddling their album in Walmart parking lots. To their surprise, people liked what they heard. \u201cThere were days we\u2019d sell a thousand CDs and come back with five or 10 thousand dollars and we realized, \u2018We might have something here\u2019,\u201d Sharpe admits. \\r\\n\\r\\nBuoyed by their early success, the teens took their show on the road, so to speak. \u201cWe loaded up and went to every small town in Georgia we knew of and hit every Spring Break imaginable,\u201d says Sharpe. \u201cWe drove all over Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and Alabama. Anywhere we could sell CDs, we did. We probably pushed 28,000 CDs out of our trunk.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe LACS recorded five CDs on their own. \u201cBy the second or third CD our fans would start to ask, \u2018When are you coming out with another one?\u2019\u201d King recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that me and Clay could have a fan base. We never thought it would get this big.\u201d  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe duo is successful because its music is authentic. Sharpe and King share stories about what they know best: country living.  \u201cWe ain\u2019t no gangsters, we ain\u2019t never killed nobody so we can\u2019t rap about that,\u201d Sharpe says. \u201cWe just started rapping about down home stuff like riding dirt roads and hunting and fishing.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe love hip hop as much as we love country, but we were born in a country place,\u201d says King, whose influences include Mark Chesnutt, Randy Travis and Tupac Shakur.  \u201cWe love doing country things, but hip hop is just as good as country. We grew up on both.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they are no doubt hick hop pioneers, the duo says they\u2019re following in the footsteps of the greats. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is what Johnny Cash did on \u2018I\u2019ve Been Everywhere\u2019,\u201d says Sharpe, who counts Cash, Hank Williams, Jr., the Beastie Boys and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony among his influences. \u201cHe was pretty much rapping on that song. Charlie Daniels has done it, and David Allan Coe did it on \u2018The Ride.\u2019 That\u2019s the evolution of hick hop.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe LACS eventually caught the attention of noted producer and Average Joes Entertainment label head Shannon Houchins, who was working with musical maverick Colt Ford. \u201cWe let him hear one of our CDs and he invited us to his studio immediately,\u201d Sharpe remembers. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019d love for you to be part of our record label.\u2019 We thought about it a couple of days and we said, \u2018let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duo has released two successful albums on Backroad Records, a subsidiary of Average Joes. As with their parking lot outings, The LACS have connected with a growing fan base. \u201cKickin\u2019 Up Mud,\u201d from their album Country Boy\u2019s Paradise, became a viral sensation despite little or no radio airplay.  \u201cThat\u2019s a song we didn\u2019t expect to do anything and it\u2019s got over nine million YouTube views now,\u201d Sharpe says.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe LACS continue to challenge the status quo on their new album, Keep It Redneck, which features the duo\u2019s trademark in-your-face musical magic as well as a few new fresh variations. \u201cEvery style of music has got to progress or people are going to get tired of it,\u201d says Sharpe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bouncy and beach-themed \u201cReLacs,\u201d which features Sarah Ross, is a new direction for the duo. \u201cWe\u2019ve never really had a beach song before,\u201d says King. \u201cWe\u2019re all about stepping out of the box and approaching subjects that we haven\u2019t approached before.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the laid back \u201cGet Lost\u201d explains, \u201cExactly how we operate in the South,\u201d says Sharpe. \u201cA lot of guys and girls go by off by themselves and get lost in the woods. Sometimes it\u2019s important to be alone.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cKick Dust,\u201d which features Noah Gordon and which is sure to become a workingman\u2019s anthem, is about ending the week on a positive note. \u201cThe song talks about being ready to get off the highway and hit a dirt road and chill,\u201d says Sharpe. \u201cAnybody can relate to that.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nBut not every song on Keep It Redneck is introspective. \u201cShichya\u201d is a party starter, while \u201cField Party\u201d is all about getting down and dirty dancing. The latter song features label mates Colt Ford and JJ Lawhorn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat began on a street corner and continued in Walmart parking lots all across the South, has now grown to fields filled with fans primed to hear The LACs\u2019 latest. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe duo regularly attracts thousands of fans to its show, which have included an appearance at the Atlanta Motor Speedway prior to a NASCAR race. \u201cThat\u2019s like the Super Bowl for us,\u201d Sharpe says. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest redneck sport in the world.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cMore and more people are showing up to hear us and that\u2019s amazing,\u201d adds King.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey\u2019ve come a long way for sure. \u201cNow Walmart is selling our CDs inside, so we don\u2019t have to sell them in the parking lot,\u201d Sharpe says with a chuckle. He\u2019s being humble. What started organically has spread. The duo has been featured in a genre-defining Wall Street Journal cover story and their previous album, 190 Proof, remained consistently on the Billboard Country Albums chart for over a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot bad for a couple of guys that have a gift for connecting with their growing legion of fans. And they\u2019re not done yet.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":768},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":240},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":160},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1638},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":80},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":400},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":520},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/54/79-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thelacsmusic.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/thelacsmusic\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/TheLacsMusic?ref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/TheLacsMusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"TheLacsMusic\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1689733,\"name\":\"Hard Target\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Hard Target is a southern hip hop based group that is more than unique and is quickly emerging onto the music scene.

So the three decided the only thing left to do would be to assume one single identity and never look back\u2026\u2026and here we have the group\u2026\u2026Hard Target!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.hardtargetmusic.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/hardtargetmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/hardtargetmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"hardtargetmusic\"},{\"id\":1689735,\"name\":\"Crucifix\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Born in Atlanta Georgia, raised in Central and East Africa, Crucifix spent much of his early childhood bouncing from continent to continent, soaking in a wide influence of music and culture. By the time he was eighteen, he was native to fifteen different countries, fluent in three languages and understood first hand the harsh reality of living face to face with the third world.  But it was his unveiling passion for music that would soon take center stage in his life.  At the age of twelve, his family moved to Congo where he first began teaching himself to play the piano, writing and producing his first music.  He quickly discovered the power of pouring out his heart into song and within a year found himself recording his first album from the comfort of his bedroom.  Making his own tapes with little more than a tape recorder and a keyboard, then designing the covers by hand, he began to build a following, selling his music at school and on the dusty streets of Congo and Rwanda.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his life would soon take a sharp turn. In April of 1994, the country of Rwanda would break out into one of the worst genocides in history, leaving over a million dead in its wake.  Cruce and his family found themselves on the front lines\u2026 a broken road of burning cars and mangled corpses the only path between them and safety. With nothing but a Bible in their hands and a prayer in their hearts, the family pushed through the chaos, escaping with their lives under a hail of gunfire as they slipped through roadblocks of machete wielding mobs, into the country of Burundi.  But the images and memories from Rwanda would forever make a lasting imprint on the life and music of Crucifix, and in time music itself would become the only outlet to save him from the silent hurt that was swelling inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005 he released his first fully independent album \\\"My Life's Prayer\\\", under the name BabyBlue.  The controversial double disc debut took the Atlanta underground by storm, boasting 28 songs and two 32 page booklets, sealing in his unique and fluid signature sound.  Mixing fast-fire Southern Hip-Hop with smooth Rock vocals, a touch of Soul and no holds barred lyrical content, Crucifix began to set a new standard for cross-genre music. A year later, in 2006, he was hired on as co-producer, editor and musical mind behind the shocking Atlanta underground film, \\\"Crackheads Gone Wild\\\", and suddenly found himself exploring the world of film. Eventually leading him to work on later film projects with Billy Ray Cyrus, Sunny Mabry, Randy Travis, Yelawolf, Bizzare of Eminem's D-12, Montgomery Gentry, Colt Ford, The Lacs, Bubba Sparxxx, as well as working along the side one of Steven Spielberg's most acclaimed editors. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut 2007 would become the year that everything changed for Crucifix.  Turning his back on the streets that had taken so much from him, and shifting his focus to the God who had brought him through the genocide. Crucifix began to mark a new path\u2026 one of hope.  In 2009 his life story was published in the book \\\"Your Own Jesus\\\" by the multi-platinum, Grammy, Dove and American Music Award winning band Casting Crowns.  In 2010 the story went international as \\\"Your Own Jesus\\\" was translated into its second language for release in Europe.  By July of the same year he released his follow up sophomore album, \\\"Cruce Signati\\\", featuring Southern HipHop legends Sean P of Youngbloodz, Goodie Mob and members of Outkast's Dungeon Family.  The first music video from the album, \\\"Down 2 Die\\\" (Feat. Sean P) quickly became an underground anthem in the 1%er biker community and Crucifix began his first tours throughout the southeast.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2012 his music was appearing in reality shows on television networks such as VH1 and he signed his first record deal with AVJ Records / Average Joes Entertainment and moved to Nashville, featuring on albums such as The Lacs \\\"190 Proof\\\" and Bubba Sparxxx \\\"Pain Management\\\".  In January of 2013 Crucifix hit MTV for the first time in the Bubba Sparxxx music video \\\"Splinter\\\", then went on to release his first full length film \\\"Road To Chernobyl\\\".  A reality style documentary following him and three freinds across the globe and into the radioactive Dead Zone of Chernobyl to shoot the music video \\\"Chernobyl\\\".  In September of 2013 he left Average Joes and moved to Denver Colorado, forming his own record label, Cruce Signati and independently releasing his third full length album \\\"Acid Reign\\\".  Produced by Phivestarr Productions, featuring Bubba Sparxxx, Nappy Roots, Sean P of Youngbloodz and Big Rube of Dungeon Family.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHe quickly followed up with his digitally remixed and remastered single and music video for \\\"The Dreamer\\\" remaining one of his most popular songs to date. Going into 2014, Crucifix launched his first clothing line The Cruce Signati Collection, driving even deeper the branding of his new independent movement.  In May of 2014 he appeared on the album \\\"Abaddon\\\" by Boondox from Psychopathic Records, dropping the music video \\\"Don't Stop\\\" and jumping on his first full nationwide tour, following up the tour with his first performance at the 2014 Gathering of the Juggalos, appearing on all three stages.  In Spring of 2015 he began his second nationwide tour with the Moonshine Bandits, writing and appearing on their album \\\"Blacked Out\\\", as well as their music video \\\"Lady Luck.\\\"  He then featured on the title track of the Lacs album \\\"Outlaw In Me\\\" making several guest appearances on their following West Coast Tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August of 2015 he jumps back on the road with the Moonshine Bandits and Jelly Roll for his third full nationwide tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nPressing forward Crucifix continues to raise the bar in the world of cross-genre music, with the same stunning quality, heartfelt lyrics and dynamic visual presence.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.crucifixmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/crucifixmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/CrucifixMusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"CrucifixMusic\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.coxcapitoltheatre.com/event/1263787?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
