Quakes\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The Quakes started in the fall of 1986 in Buffalo, New York.\\r\\nThe original members were Paul Roman on guitar and vocals, Dave \\\"the ace\\\" Hoy on drums and Rob Peltier on upright bass.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the beginning The Quakes were playing neo rockabilly in the vein of The Stray Cats,Rockats and Polecats.\\r\\nOut of frustration with a lack of response locally,The Quakes started to play a lot faster and more aggressive adding punk\\r\\nelements to their music. The look went from pegged pants and bowling shirts to ripped jeans and combat boots.\\r\\nFrom that point on the band would be know as a psychobilly band.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 1987, The Quakes sold all their possessions and moved to London England. London was ground zero\\r\\nfor the psychobilly scene at that time.The band landed a spot on a psychobilly festival in Weize, Belgium.\\r\\nUpon returning to England, the band was stopped at customs and they were deported because they didn't have work permits.\\r\\nThe Quakes went on to do tour of Belgium and Germany supporting the Coffin Nails in early 1988.It was during this\\r\\ntime that The Quakes were signed by Nervous records in London to record a full length album.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band was living in London when their first self titled album was recorded. It was released in June of 1988.\\r\\nThe album was very raw and had a style all its own. Popular songs from this album included \\\"Pack our bags and go\\\"\\r\\nand \\\" Psychobilly Jekyll & Mr. Hyde\\\".During the summer of 1988, The Quakes played around London at places like\\r\\nDingwalls and the Klubfoot.\\r\\nUpon his return to Buffalo,Dave \\\"the ace\\\"Hoy was killed when he was struck by a car crossing a highway.\\r\\nHis death occurred a week before his 18th birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 1989 the Quakes reformed with Chris Van Cleve on drums. Van Cleve had been a member on and off and\\r\\nwas a part of Roman and Hoy's previous bands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Quakes were invited to play at the first and second Big Rumble festivals in England and did some small tours in\\r\\nEurope before recording another album for Nervous records.\\\"Voice of America\\\" was released in June of 1990.\\r\\nThe Quakes second album was a departure from the hard psychobilly of the first record. On Voice of America,\\r\\nThe Quakes blurred the line between psychobilly and rockabilly. Brian Doran had joined as the bands drummer\\r\\nduring this time.Popular songs from this album include \\\"Puttin' out the flame\\\" \\\"Stick to your guns\\\" and a cover of\\r\\nThe Rolling Stones \\\"Paint it Black\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, Chris Van Cleve returned to play the drums.\\r\\nMore festivals and tours in Europe followed including a full tour of Japan.\\r\\nPlanet records in Japan recorded the Tokyo performance and released a live Cd from the show.\\r\\nA representative from Sony/Japan was in the audience and offered The Quakes a recording deal with Sony.\\r\\n\\\"New Generation\\\" was recorded in 1992 and released in the spring of 1993 for Sony/Japan.\\r\\nThe Quakes then did a 13 show tour of Japan. New Generation again took The Quakes in a new direction.\\r\\nThis time the band fused rockabilly with new wave attempting to cross over into a broader market with more melodic\\r\\nsongs and a polished production.The album sold well in Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995 ,The Quakes recorded their fourth studio album \\\"Quiff Rock\\\".The band returned to their roots and stripped down\\r\\nthe production.In a strange twist, the one song that had a bit of production \\\"Thrills and sensations\\\" , seemed to be a fan\\r\\nfavorite from the album.TheQuakes continued to play festivals in Europe during this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next few years the scene seemed to be dying.\\r\\nThe Quakes would continue to play a couple big festivals in Europe each year but not much else.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000 There was finally some interest in psychobilly brewing in the United States.\\r\\nThe Quakes played at the American Rumble in New Jersey on Halloween weekend.\\r\\nIn January 2001 they started work on a new album.\\r\\n\\\"Last of the human beings\\\" was released in October of 2001 on Paul Roman's new label Orrexx records. This album was\\r\\na mixture of old Quakes style and some new twists and turns. The album featured popular songs such as \\\"Revenge is mine\\\"\\r\\nand a cover of Echo and the Bunnymen's \\\"Killing moon\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002,The Quakes played more festivals in Germany. In May of 2003, they headlined the American Nightmare festival\\r\\nin Pomona ,CA. In July 2003 they played at the Calella festival in Spain and then did tour of Finland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2004, Paul Roman moved to Finland and put a new band together called The Paul Roman 3.\\r\\nThe band was doing mostly Quakes songs from all albums and a few new ones in the same style.\\r\\nIn the summer of 2004, The Paul Roman 3 did a total of 25 shows in Finland,Russia, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Austria.\\r\\nIn October 2004, The Quakes headlined the Wreckers Ball 2 in Hollywood,CA.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2005, The Paul Roman 3 played two shows in the Ukraine.\\r\\nIn June,The Quakes did a small southwest tour of the United States.\\r\\nIn December 2005, The Quakes 6th studio album \\\"Psyops\\\" was released.The album proved to be a hit with fans\\r\\ncombining new wave with psychobilly. Several popular songs came off this album including \\\"USA Psychos\\\", \\\"I Miss You\\\"\\r\\nand a cover of Real Life's \\\"Send me an Angel\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n2006 was a big year for The Quakes. It has been 20 years since the band started.\\r\\nA 34 show US tour followed. The Quakes then did 23 shows in Europe in October.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007 The Quakes re released the album Quiff Rock which was originally on Tombdisc records.\\r\\nThe new release on Orrexx records had 8 extra songs and extended liner notes.\\r\\nKenny Hill was added to the line up on slap bass .The band did a short southwest tour of the USA.
