During the early years, the lineup was stable. The initial lineup consisted of Colin and Jorge on vocals, Yureesh on drums, Hank on guitar, and Mark on bass. Colin stepped out for several months to finish his education while Rachel, Rivits' singer, took his place.\\r\\nAt this point, Colin, Jorge, Yureesh, and Mark put together a demo. Fred replaced Hank, but then Fred left to go to school, and Scott from C-Squat filled in. Another guitarist, Steve, from Distraught, also filled in during this period. The EP 40 Oz. Casualty was recorded. By 1992, the band was touring and building up a fan base in NYC. In 1993, bassist Mark and guitarist Fred were replaced by Mike and Jake, respectively and Yureesh was replaced by Shawn on drums in 1994. In 1995, the band's second release, the \\\"A Fuckin Way Of Life\\\" E.P. was released on Eyeball Records. In 1996, Shawn left the band, and Meggers of the Rivits came to fill in and became the regular drummer. The line-up of Jorge, Jake, Mike and Meggers continued until 1997. Johnny (Of The Krays) served as bassist until 1998 (a position more permanently filled by Rick later that year).\\r\\nThe Casualties have continued to produce high-energy recordings and they have done US and international tours (e.g., Europe, Japan, and El Salvador). Under Attack was released on SideOneDummy Records in 2006, and they toured virtually non-stop for three years in support of the album. Their newest album, We Are All We Have, was released on the SideOneDummy label on August 25, 2009.\\r\\nIn December 2009, The Casualties toured alongside Hatebreed, The Acacia Strain, Crowbar, and Thy Will Be Done as part of the Stillborn Fest.\\r\\nThe Casualties are currently recording a new album with famed producer Zeuss, which is set to be released in Summer 2012.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":288},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":288},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":90},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":90},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":60},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":60},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-og.jpg\",\"width\":1500,\"height\":450},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":30},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":30},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":150},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":150},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":195},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/23/23-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":195}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.itunes.com/thecasualties\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/thecasualties\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/TheCasualties\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/theCasualties\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"theCasualties\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":578593,\"name\":\"The Virus\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The Virus formed in Feb. 1998 and we played our first show only a month later. During the first 6 months that the band was together, we got to play quite a few great shows including a show in Philadelphia, PA with Special Duties, and a show at now closed Coney Island High in NYC. In July 1998 we recorded 2 songs for a split CD with New York band- The Manix (with members of the Devotchkas & Casualties). Only 130 copies of the CD were made and they sold out quickly. \\r\\n\\r\\n1999\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Feb. 1999 we recorded 5 songs for our first 7\\\" titled 'Global Crisis' and for the Punx Unite 2 compilation on Charged Records. The 7\\\" sold out pretty quickly and we started getting a lot more show offers so we continued to play regularly all over the east coast. \\r\\n\\r\\n2000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarch 2000 we went back into the studio and recorded 12 songs for our first full length CD/LP titled 'Still Fighting For A Future' on Charged Records. After the album was recorded singer Mike Virus left the band and Paul took over on vocals. Later that year, in June, we left for a six week USA tour with: Casualties, Endless Struggle, Antidote, & Funeral Dress. This tour helped out the band tremendously because we made a lot of new fans and contacts. \\r\\n\\r\\n2001\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2001 we went back into the studio once again to record 4 new songs for a limited picture disc 7\\\" to be released on Charged Records. After the songs were recorded, Punkcore Records bought the rights to release the picture disc from Charged Records. Punkcore Records released the 7\\\" in October of 2001 along with a 'Singles & Rarities' CD which was a collection of all the band's 7\\\"s, and compilation tracks. In June of 2001 we played the 2-day Promote Chaos festival in Atlanta, GA alongside bands like: Anti-Nowhere League, Crack, and Peter and The Test Tube Babies. A month later we went over to Morecambe, England to play the Holidays In The Sun festival alongside bands like: Exploited, Partisans, GBH, UK Subs, Resistance 77, Threats, Cock Sparrer, plus many others. Late August saw the band on a short east coast tour with Antidote from Holland. This tour was nothing short of a disaster with van problems and show cancellations. However, the shows we got to play were great so that made up for the other problems. After returning from tour the band took the next the next five months off to write and record our second 12 song CD/LP titled 'Nowhere To Hide' on Punkcore Records.\\r\\n\\r\\n2002\\r\\n\\r\\nFeb 2002 saw the band back in the studio to record our second full length album. Then on Feb 15th, we played in Philadelphia, PA with Slaughter & The Dogs which was our first show in nearly 5 months! After that, we were back to playing regular weekend shows all over the east coast. In April, the \\\"Nowhere To Hide\\\" CD & LP was released. In July we went over to play the Holidays In The Sun festival in England. It was great to see a lot of the people we met at HITS the previous year. Once we got home we only had a week to rest before we took off across country for a short west coast tour with The Riffs from Portland. This was definitely our most successful tour to date and much like our last west coast tour, we met a ton of people and we had a great time at the shows. We played the HITS fest in Asbury Park, NJ. in early September. The festival went over well and it was sort of like a family reunion for us because most of the U.S. bands that we had been playing shows with early on (Casualties, Unseen, Violent Society, Boils, Endless Struggle) were also playing the festival. The highlight of the festival for us was having Wattie from the Exploited, join us on stage to sing our cover version of The Exploited's \\\"I Believe In Anarchy\\\". We decided to return to California at the end of the year to play three shows in Hollywood, Pomona, and San Diego with The Riffs & The Voids. All three shows were very successful and it was a great way to end the year.\\r\\n\\r\\n2003\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Jan, the band went into the studio to record 7 songs. Four of those 7 songs were for the 'Benefits Of War' 7\\\" released on Dirty Punk Records, and the remaining 3 songs were demos that remain unreleased as of now. On Feb 14th, the band played its 5 year anniversary show in Philadelphia with guest vocalist Mike Virus from the band's original line-up. In May, the band saw another line-up change with the departure of the band's second vocalist, Paul. At this time the band had already had a 10 week tour planned and many of the dates were already booked. Faced with the choices of either throwing in the towel or continuing forward with a different singer, the band chose to go forward. So the band acquired it's third vocalist, Jasper, from the very successful Boston, MA. band, The Vigilantes. For the next month the band practiced continually to prepare the new singer. Then from the beginning of July until mid September, the band toured the U.S.A. and Canada with long time New Jersey veterans--Blind Society. This was the first time The Virus had been on a full U.S.A. tour in almost 3 years! This was also the first time the band had played any shows in Canada. The tour was a great success and the band had the chance to play quite a few places that they had not previously played such as: Las Vegas, New Orleans, Montreal, Toronto, St. Louis, etc. Unfortunately the bands were denied entry into Canada on the west coast side because customs would not let them in with their trailers, merchandise, and equipment. After the tour, the band took a two week break and then they went to Puerto Rico for one show in Pinones. This was the band's first time in Puerto Rico and it was a great trip! After returning from Puerto Rico, the band went back to practicing and writing song for a 3rd full length to be released on Punk Core Records. In October, the band went through another line-up change with the departure of rhythm guitarist Josh.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":197,\"height\":197},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":197,\"height\":197},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":197,\"height\":197},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":197,\"height\":197},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":197,\"height\":197},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-og.jpg\",\"width\":197,\"height\":197},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":197,\"height\":197},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":197,\"height\":197},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":197,\"height\":197},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/13/09-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":197,\"height\":197}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.viruspunks.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/viruspunks\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":96467,\"name\":\"Last False Hope\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Part city slickers, part scumpunks, and full on music junkies, Last False Hope hails from Chicago. Their unique sound of underground bluegrass combined with their roots in punk and metal is a loose bull in a china shop. This clash of genres that they have dubbed \\\"Brutal-Grass\\\" has quickly earned them a name in and out of The Windy City. The idea was cooked up by Jahshie P., a longtime veteran of the Chicago music scene. Best known as the former frontman of Failed Resistance, My Vengeance, and Michael Jackson punk cover band Neverland, Jahshie P. developed an intense interest in country western and bluegrass music, along with a new-found passion for the mandolin. Come the summer of 2009, his new skills began to translate into songs. His first step was to bring his than wife, Kristina Nutting, a newcomer to the Chicago music scene, along for the ride. She would rapidly warm up to the banjo. Quick to the draw, they set forth to include a track on the Outlaw Radio Compilation Volume One. To fill in the blanks they recruited producer Shawn Connors, best known as the drummer of death metal band Bound And Gagged, who later joined Jahshie P. in Neverland, as well as a number of other fly-by-night acts. To fill in the line-up, Arcadia Kust was added on fiddle, Sean Moriarty on guitar, and Dave Beneventi was lifted from local Irish punk act The Fisticuffs to play bass. Former My Vengeance members Steve Stepien and David Wiegers- who also played guitar in Neverland- were recruited to play drums and guitar, respectively. This line-up would go on to record \\\"$2 Pints\\\" for the comp. Over the course of roughly the next year, the seven of them would write many songs and play several shows to unsuspecting audiences who would become die-hard fans of this new sound. Come September 2010, they re-enlisted Shawn Connors to begin work on the debut EP, \\\"The Shape Of Bluegrass To Come.\\\" Four songs- \\\"Giving Up God For Lent\\\", \\\"Drag Me To Hell\\\", \\\"You Drink, You Drive, She Wins\\\", and \\\"Dying and Diseased\\\"- would make the final cut. The EP was released on March 1st through Pint Of Happiness Records. After the conclusion of the \\\"The Shape of Bluegrass To Come\\\" sessions, Sean, Arcadia, and Dave B parted ways with the band. Shawn Connors has since joined to fill the open guitar position, along with Scott Farruggia- also from Bound And Gagged and Neverland- on bass, and friend-of-a-friend Colleen Mary on fiddle. The new line-up was debuted on the Southern Independent Volume One compilation with a track titled \\\"Guilty Until Proven Innocent.\\\" A versus split with Nellie Wilson & the Hellbound Honeys was released on Jahshie P.'s own Solitary Records in 2011. Since their inception, LFH has shared the stage with the likes of Star Fucking Hipsters, Danzig, Bad Religion, Those Poor Bastards, World/Inferno Friendship Society, The Casualties, .357 String Band, Hellbound Glory, The Goddamn Gallows, and The Unseen. They were also named the Best Country Band in the Chicago Reader \\\"Best of Chicago 2011\\\" and again in 2012. reader's poll. Despite many changes in their crew- June 2013 saw Tina's departure- Last False Hope pushes on. Their debut album, \\\"Dig Nails Deep\\\", will be released in November on Solitary Records/Black Country Rock.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/LastFalseHope\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1334841?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
