Born and raised in the deep south of the Alabama Gulf Coast, he ingested eclectic FM radio sounds and the music of nearby New Orleans. In his quest to develop his musical capacities to their fullest, Will Kimbrough has become a modern-day Renaissance Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nKimbrough's body of work reflects a lifetime of performing, writing and collaborating from more angles than Da Vinci's protractor. True to his search for universal truths, his profound musical knowledge and expert creations reflect years of learning the intricacies of folk, blues, gospel, country, rock'n'roll, punk rock and jazz.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith songs recorded by Jimmy Buffett, Little Feat, Jack Ingram, Todd Snider and others, Kimbrough's multidisciplinary approach has led to many desirable collaborations in the studio and on-stage with well-known artists, including Rosanne Cash, Guy Clark, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Gomez, Emmylou Harris, the Jayhawks, Mark Knopfler, Buddy Miller, John Prine, Toumani Diabate, Kim Richey, Josh Rouse, Matthew Ryan, Billy Joe Shaver, Todd Snider, Mavis Staples, by fans as a way to explain his masterful performance on the guitar, Kimbrough was recognized in 2004 as the Instrumentalist of the Year by the Americana Music Association \u2013 an award that had previously been awarded three years in a row to Dobro ace Jerry Douglas.\\r\\n\\r\\nKimbrough earned his graduate degree on the club circuit shortly after finishing high school. Investing years of single-minded devotion to his craft, Will moved to Nashville with his first band \u2013 Will and the Bushmen \u2013 and was quickly signed to a major label record deal. Following that 15 minutes of fame, Will formed The Bis-quits with Tommy Womack, Mike Grimes and Tommy Meyer and released one CD on John Prine's Oh Boy! Records.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving spent several years on the road and in the studio with folk star Todd Snider, Kimbrough has also toured and recorded extensively with Grammy winners like Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell, and produced a Grammy-nominated CD for Adrienne Young, in addition to producing the noted East Nashville Skyline and The Devil You Know albums for Todd Snider \u2013 two of his most acclaimed recordings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith 10 artist albums to his credit, Will has released five solo recordings and five albums as a founding member of DADDY, the bis-quits, and Will and the Bushmen. Kimbrough turned ears and earned new fans along with praise from the media for his outspoken Americanitis (2005) album, which cast a critical eye on early 21st century America.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, Will released EP \u2013 his solo studio recording that revealed a hint of what would develop on his next full-length release. All Music Guide wrote, \\\"Wonderfully written and executed songs: sparse yet full of literacy, emotion and a primitive's attitude to modern invention, though there is nothing remotely primitive about the sound or craft on this short set.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKimbrough spent much of 2009 working with DADDY, a band he co-founded with Tommy Womack, featuring John Deaderick, Paul Griffith & Dave Jacques. The band released For A Second Time \u2013 their first studio recording and second album \u2013 for Father's Day and have spent much of the year touring and showcasing at major national festivals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lead track on the DADDY album \u2013 Nobody From Nowhere \u2013 struck a chord with Jimmy Buffett who ended up recording the song for his new Buffet Hotel album released in December 2009. But Jimmy wanted more, and tapped Will Kimbrough for three other co-written songs on Buffet Hotel, including Wings \u2013 which is also the title track on Will new 2010 studio album.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe songs on Wings invite the listener to comprehend the universe with a modern introspective eye. Exploring themes surrounding the conflict between family and career, love and work, parents and children, the music is based in classic folk rock, with touches of atmospheric guitar, cello, saxophone, trumpet, banjo, Hammond organ.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2013, Will traveled to Key West to work on \\\"Songs From St Somewhere\\\", the fourth consecutive Jimmy Buffett album Kimbrough has played on and contributed songs to. He wrote or co-wrote three of the songs for the collection, slated for a December 2013 release.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill is also a member of Gulf Coast group Willie Sugarcapps, a very organic collaboration with Grayson Capps, guitarist Corky Hughes and the duo Sugarcane Jane (Anthony Crawford and Savana Lee). Their debut album is being released by Royal Potato Family Records of Brooklyn in Aug 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill Kimbrough's latest album, his seventh solo long-player, is Sideshow Love, a 12 track song cycle exploring the human heart and love in all its guises. According to close friend and longtime partner Tommy Womack, Sideshow Love is not only the best showcase for Kimbrough's guitar work, but his best collection of songs yet. The record focuses on love in all forms, the ups and downs of romantic love, wistful longing, spiritual wandering and old fashioned lust. Sideshow Love was released in Fall 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2016, Willie Sugarcapps will release their 2nd full-length album, Paradise Right Here.  Recorded at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, mixed by multiple Grammy winner Trina Shoemaker, co-produced by the band and Shoemaker, the record is at once a big step forward for the Lower Alabama roots collective, yet retains their debut album's raw, live, real soulfulness.  Paradise Right Here is deeper and darker than the first album; but hope shines through, along with the wonderful collaborative energy everyone loves about Willie Sugarcapps.  (Willie Sugarcapps, Paradise Right Here, April 15, 2016, Baldwin County Public Records, http://www.bcpr.rocks/).\\r\\n\\r\\nWill is currently finishing up work on Doug Seegers' 2nd album\u2014the followup to \\\"Going Down To The River\\\", which was a smash hit in Scandinavia\u2014\\\"Walking On The Edge Of The World\\\"\u2014will be released in May 2016 on Lionheart/Capitol Records in Sweden in May 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nKimbrough is also finishing up a duets record with soulful singer songwriter Brigitte DeMeyer.  Will and Brigitte wrote almost all the songs on DeMeyer's most recent album, \\\"Savannah Road\\\".  This time around, they decided to go ahead and do an album together.  Full of soul, humor, poetry and picking, \\\"Mockingbird Soul\\\" will be released in Fall of 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe multi-talented, active father of two continues to make a lasting contribution to every project he produces, performs and creates.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1440},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-og.jpg\",\"width\":1365,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":975},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/41/57-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://willkimbrough.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/willkimbroughmusic\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/will-kimbrough/6324022276\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/WillKimbrough\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"WillKimbrough\"},{\"id\":1172145,\"name\":\"Brigitte DeMeyer\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"BRIGITTE DeMeyer is a very discussed artist in the Americana movement. Her work has stirred accolades in national media. She has been tapped to open for Bob Dylan, among others, and has toured frequently at home and abroad. Brigitte DeMeyer writes songs as weavers thread tapestries, her most vivid colors being a Southern feel, a churchy soulfulness in her vocals, and a way with words that bears comparison to literature as easily as to the best contemporary lyrics. For DeMeyer, it is just a matter of time.\\n\\nWith album number six on the horizon for the acclaimed independent singer-songwriter, \\\"Savannah Road\\\" (due out in early 2014), DeMeyer has built a solid foundation with her first five albums, collaborating with giants of the Americana world-world class drummer/producer Brady Blade, Buddy Miller, Sam Bush, and most recently guitarist/songwriter Will Kimbrough, to name a few\u2014and has shown herself to have a wonderfully natural feel for soul-steeped, blues-infused roots music, right down to her supple, peppery singing.\\n\\nThe daughter of Belgian and German immigrants, she was born in the Midwest, and at a young age moved to Southern California with her family, where entirely on her own, she started latching onto rootsy sounds, from Etta James, Mavis Staples and Sly Stone, to her discovery of The Allman Brothers, Steve Earle and Patti Griffin.\\n\\nThough DeMeyer took to soulful southern-tinged music, and had a gift for it,  she early on, acquired a non-musical Bachelor's degree and pursued Post Baccalaureate studies working in the marketing world to produce a steady income, all the while making music on the side, (even studying with vocal coach Judy Davis, who had been a mainstay instructor for Janis Joplin and Barbara Streisand). \\\"I loved studying with Judy, but I always felt my best lessons were from the folks I listened to and played with, and from the places where I made my mistakes\u2026it all just gives you tools to be better, but you gotta work at it.\\\" says DeMeyer. She ultimately turned the by-the-book plan on its head, taking a brave leap into pursuing music full-time. The roundabout route has served the substance of her songs well. As she puts it, \\\"I had to struggle a little for a while, paying the rent and getting my heart broken a time or two\\\"\u2026but got the experience and insight I needed to be able to write. \\\"\\n\\nIt didn't take DeMeyer long to find kindred musical spirits. Brady Blade and DeMeyer hit it off after DeMeyer approached him to guest on her 2nd CD, Nothing Comes Free. He signed on to play, and produced the next two, Something After All and Red River Flower, and co-produced DeMeyer's 5th CD, Rose of Jericho, with DeMeyer, bringing in a small army of masterly players and singers over the years he knew would appreciate what she was doing. Players like Buddy Miller (with whom she's since shared the stage on more than one occasion), Steve Earle, Ivan Neville, Daniel Lanois, the Indigo Girls' Emily Saliers, the McCrary Sisters and Al Perkins (who invited her to join two European tours). On her 5th CD Rose of Jericho, DeMeyer expanded her impressive stable of collaborators with contributions from full-throated force of nature Mike Farris, guitar gurus Will Kimbrough and Doug Lancio and mandolin virtuoso Sam Bush.\\n\\nWith a 2010 relocation from California to Nashville, DeMeyer has been delving deeper into southern musical territory.  Gaining momentum and visibility as a performing artist, and recently has built a strong partnership with guitarist/songwriter Will Kimbrough, with whom she has toured and collaborated since 2010. The songs DeMeyer has been writing, primarily with Kimbrough, are less a mixture of firsthand experience, but more a rich blend of fingerpicking, blues inflection, and literary imagery. Acoustic soul. The songs stem from DeMeyer and Kimbrough's musical chemistry, and are brought further to life with additional players Brady Blade, keyboardist Jimmy Wallace, guitar/mandolinist Guthrie Trapp, and bassist Chris Donohue. Also featured are friends the McCrary Sisters, and Ricky and Micol Davis of Blue Mother Tupelo, Bassist Michael Rhodes, and Wood Brother's Jano Rix.\\n\\nWith DeMeyer's lyrical skill, ease with melody, and expressive vocals, combined with Kimbrough's mastery of strings, the result is Savannah Road, a spooky and soulful collection of songs, taking the listener to another time and place. Some place long ago. It is sure to stand out in 2014's musical landscape.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":590,\"height\":304},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":590,\"height\":304},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":155},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":155},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":103},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":103},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-og.jpg\",\"width\":590,\"height\":304},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":52},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":52},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":258},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":258},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":590,\"height\":304},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/56/39/13-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":590,\"height\":304}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.brigittedemeyer.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/brigittedemeyer\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/brigittedemeyer\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/BrigitteDeMeyer\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"BrigitteDeMeyer\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1385533?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
