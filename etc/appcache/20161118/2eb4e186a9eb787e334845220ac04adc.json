It's time Ben Caplan gave his legions of fans what they've been waiting for these four \\r\\nlong years.  After criss\\r\\n-\\r\\ncrossing Canada and the US, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and some \\r\\ndozen countries across Europe, Caplan has finally stopped long\\r\\n enough to deliver the long\\r\\n-\\r\\ndesired follow\\r\\n-\\r\\nup album to his 2011 debut, \\r\\nIn the Time of the Great Remembering\\r\\n.  Welcome \\r\\nthen, to \\r\\nBirds with Broken Wings\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\\"I think it could have been time for a new album years ago,\\\" admits our hir\\r\\nsute hero.  \\\"but \\r\\nI \\r\\nwanted to\\r\\n take my time and honour the process. There was a lot to learn. I wanted to make an \\r\\nalbum that was complex but with room for strangers to find their way into it. I wanted to \\r\\ncollaborate with people who inspire me and discover unexpected things. It takes ti\\r\\nme.\\\"\\r\\nIt turns out this could be the best record you'll hear all year.  Caplan has moved his sound by \\r\\nleaps and bounds, his soul\\r\\n-\\r\\nfired, charismatic music exploding out in surprising new directions.  \\r\\nAlong the way, he joined forces with over 30 different mu\\r\\nsicians, a raft of unconventional \\r\\nacoustic instruments, and the hottest production/ar\\r\\nranging/mixing team imaginable.  The eleven \\r\\nsongs that make up \\r\\nBirds with Broken Wings \\r\\nrange from angry and edgy to dramatic and \\r\\ninspirational, to some of the most unconve\\r\\nntional and beautiful work Caplan or anyone else has \\r\\nmade.  All your expectations of what a Ben Caplan album could be are met, but you'll also hear \\r\\nhim like you never believed you would.  You'll get that blustery, raspy, fire\\r\\n-\\r\\nand\\r\\n-\\r\\nbrimstone force \\r\\nof nature,\\r\\n but then he'll woo you with rich and delicate vocals as lovely as any you've heard.\\r\\nThe album took a long time, and great care went into it, but that's only part of the journey.  Most \\r\\nof it was spent on the road.  Since the release of his first album, Ca\\r\\nplan has played well over a \\r\\nthousand shows.  He was on the road from eight to ten months of each year.  Many bands don't \\r\\nplay that many gigs in their entire career.  \\r\\nWhy so much?  \\\"Because I want to live this music, \\r\\nand that's the only way I can think of \\r\\nto do it,\\\" Caplan explains.  \\\"To afford the luxury of \\r\\ndeveloping your craft for a living, it's either winning the lottery or working your ass off.\\\"\\r\\nThat hard work has paid off, as Caplan has built a loyal fan base that stretches from the U.S., to \\r\\nmost of \\r\\nEurope, and of course, coast\\r\\n-\\r\\nto\\r\\n-\\r\\ncoast in Canada.  When he launched a Pledge \\r\\ncampaign to fund the new album, the full target goal was reached in just 48 hours. \\\"I'm very \\r\\nfortunate that going into my second record I have a spectacular platform,\\\" he confides.\\r\\n  \\\"I have \\r\\nover 20,000 fans engaged online and listeners in more than 30 countries. I have this broad \\r\\ninternational fan base, but it's all a little under the radar. I wanted to make a record that my \\r\\naudience would be excited to hear and that they would be e\\r\\nxcited to share.\u201d\\r\\nIt's no surprise that the seeds of the alb\\r\\num were sown on tour. \\r\\nCaplan was already a fan of \\r\\nMontreal producer and rapper Josh \\\"Socalled\\\" Dolgin, known for his unique blend of hip\\r\\n-\\r\\nhop \\r\\nand klezmer. Even though they both live in Canada, Cap\\r\\nlan only met him by chance while \\r\\ntouring in Eastern Europe. \\\"I met Socalled at the Green Zoo festival in Poland,\\\" he explains. \\\"I \\r\\nfound out he was playing, and I had been trying to answer the question of who was going to \\r\\nproduce the album for months at tha\\r\\nt point. I went to his set, hoping to meet him and find out if \\r\\nwe could work together. Seeing him perform live and the way that he unpretentiously flowed \\r\\nbetween different styles, fusing seemingly disparate genres, really captured my attention. After \\r\\nseein\\r\\ng his set, I knew I had to work with this guy. I am grateful he signed on!\\\"\\r\\n\\\"We got crazy with instrumentation and arrangements and bringing in guest musicians, more \\r\\nthan 30 different players on the record,\\\" say Caplan, still spinning from the process.  \\r\\n\\\"We \\r\\nrecorded for weeks, 10\\r\\n-\\r\\nhour days, grabbing sounds, and re\\r\\n-\\r\\ndoing this and overdubbing that, \\r\\nbringing in new people and recording things that we knew we might not use, but that could \\r\\nperhaps provide those juicy little moments.  We spent days upon days, w\\r\\neeks, almost as much \\r\\ntime as we spent recording it, maybe more, editing it, and hacking everything down to its most \\r\\nessential moments.\\\"  \\r\\nIt's perhaps the most eclectic group of musicians ever found in one set of credits, including the \\r\\ngreat James Brown a\\r\\nnd P\\r\\n-\\r\\nFunk trombonist Fred Wesley, \\r\\nwho arranged one cut. \\r\\n\\\"We got the \\r\\nprincipal harpist from the Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal to come throw down some harp,\\\" \\r\\nadds Caplan. \\\"We got the amazing Joe Grass from Patrick Watson's band on pedal steel, \\r\\nalongside \\r\\nMohamed Raky, a darbouka player from North Africa. And the cimbalom player, \\r\\nNicolae M\\r\\n\u0103\\r\\nrgineanu, he used to be the conductor of the Moldavian Symphony Orchestra, and \\r\\nwas once a professional concert cimbalomist. I guess there aren't a lot of concert cimbalom\\r\\n gigs \\r\\nin Canada so perhaps he's a hidden gem. I feel very privileged to have worked with him.\\\"\\r\\nRemarkably, with all those players and choices, the album turned out uncluttered, and an aural \\r\\ndelight.  \\\"The last step was taking to this mixer in Paris, this \\r\\nguy Renaud Letang,\\\" says Caplan. \\r\\n\\\"In my mind, Renaud is the top of the top. He's an unknown to most fans of music, but his ears \\r\\nhave had a major impact on a ton of records people know and love.  He did all the Manu Chau \\r\\nalbums, he mixed the last three or f\\r\\nour Feist albums, and all the recent Gonzales stuff, Alain \\r\\nSouchon, Seu Jorge, and on and on. His mixes are always super clear and beautiful. I really \\r\\nthink he's a untouchable. And the vocals are always very clear. With the plethora of sounds on \\r\\nthis album\\r\\n, I wanted to make sure we would have mixes where the vocals would still sit on top \\r\\nand sound very clear. I didn't want all the ear candy to distract.\\\"\\r\\nThose lyrics and themes are at the core of understanding Ben Caplan.  \\\"I try not to sing cliches,\\\" \\r\\nhe a\\r\\ndvises. \\\"I'm fighting to make sure that any lyric I settle on will be something I can live with \\r\\nfor a long time.\\\" To that end, his songs are full of major topics of our time, holding a mirror up to \\r\\nsociety so we can take a good, long look at ourselves.  \\\"I\\r\\n like looking at the ugly bits, celebrating \\r\\nthe darkness and the nasty bits that are at the root of the sublime.\u201d\\r\\nThe nasty bits include the title cut, a song about extremism in it's many forms and about people \\r\\nwho believe in pursuing ends without examini\\r\\nng the consequences of the means. The song \\r\\nDusk talks about the dangers of the oil economy. While those songs are among the most \\r\\nenergetic on the album, perhaps the quieter numbers stand out even more.  Known for his lower \\r\\nrange and his great growl, here C\\r\\naplan is able to show off the impressive softer side of his \\r\\nvocals, away from the stage.\\r\\nThat's heard the best in the beautiful and brave performance on Night Like Tonight.  With its \\r\\nwoodwinds, brass, strings and vintage crooner arrangement, Caplan drops \\r\\nthe rasp from his \\r\\nvoice, adds trills and reaches high notes never heard before in his repertoire. He pulls it off \\r\\nsplendidly, as he does all the other themes, styles, and ideas overflowing on the new album. \\r\\nDon't spend a lot of time worrying about what t\\r\\no call \\r\\nBirds with Broken Wings \\r\\nthough.  It defies \\r\\ndescription, even to its creator. \\\"I don't make dance music, but it's music that you'll want to move \\r\\nto,\\\" he offers.  \\\"I don't know exactly what it is that I'm trying to do, I just do it. The instrumentatio\\r\\nn \\r\\nis very different from song to song.  I don't ask myself what genre it is, and I don't let that trouble \\r\\nme.  That's why I wanted to work with Socalled, his albums aren't exactly hip\\r\\n-\\r\\nhop or klezmer, or \\r\\nany of the many other things they get called. They ar\\r\\ne always a thousand things rolled into one. \\r\\nA profusion of diverse musical threads weaved into one tapestry.\\\"\\r\\nMaybe that's the best description of Ben Caplan, a thousand things rolled into one.  He's a road \\r\\nwarrior, an international presence, a one\\r\\n-\\r\\nof\\r\\n-\\r\\na\\r\\n-\\r\\nk\\r\\nind performer.  Now, he has the album to put him \\r\\non everyone's radar as well.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1366},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/44/13-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://bencaplan.ca/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/bencaplanmusic?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bencaplanmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bencaplanmusic\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1500211,\"name\":\"With Special Guests\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1323575?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
