A fifth-generation descendant of Wyoming homesteaders, the ranch hand turned troubadour has seen a lot of life in his 26 years on this mortal coil, and his self- titled album, released under the auspices of Bill Hill Records, distributed by Thirty Tigers, serves as a rollicking document of his experiences. The record is teeming with colorful characters, captured in hardscrabble yarns of living hard and drinking harder, making bad choices and laughing them off. There\u2019s a little bit of their author in each of these flawed but redeemable characters\u2014and at a time when authenticity is in short supply, Luke Bell has come along to remind us what it feels like to be truly alive and open to the possibilities of existence in a captivating song cycle that puts the cowboy back into country & western.\\r\\nA life-embracing, go-for-the-gusto spirit animates Bell\u2019s vividly drawn characters, but an aching melancholy lurks just below the surface. Describing the deeply soulful, deeply American character of Bell\u2019s music in an introductory piece posted on Daytrotter, Sean Moeller insightfully wrote, \u201cThere\u2019s the lonesomeness that\u2019s a birthright for all of the wandering souls. There\u2019s the heartbreak that comes from that. And then there\u2019s the laughing off of that heartbreak in that way that makes it evident that the heartbreak\u2019s not being laughed off at all...even as the singer cocks his hat to the side, smiles and throws back another whiskey with a generous thank you.\u201d\\r\\nBell came of age with dirt collecting under his fingernails and music working its way into his head. He remembers the summers he spent working on his grandparents\u2019 ranch, starting at the age of 13, as \u201clots of hot days, Randy Travis tapes and old pick-up trucks with broken door handles\u201d\u2014the words sounding like a line from one of his songs.\\r\\n\u201cWhen I was out there workin\u2019 for my grandparents the summer after I graduated from high school, it kinda took hold,\u201d Bell recalls about his deepening interest in music. \u201cI grew up with country radio, of course, Randy Travis, Toby Keith and all that stuff. But I didn\u2019t become influenced by classic country until I found a record player and Merle Haggard\u2019s Live From Muscogee in my grandparents\u2019 basement, and took \u2019em to this little house I was livin\u2019 in. I thought that record was really cool; I\u2019d listen to it all the time after work. Then I found some other stuff, like Waylon. And my grandfather was always a huge fan of Hank Snow and Ian Tyson, cowboy music and poetry, so I grew up around a lot of that stuff by default.\u201d\\r\\nEventually, songs of his own began to take shape\u2014songs rooted in those old records, working the soil and knocking \u2019em back, taking life as it comes in Big Sky Country.\\r\\nHe spent a couple of years studying agroecology at the University of Wyoming by day and playing music in front of crowds of folkies at the Buckhorn Bar by night. When the music started crowding out the classwork, he headed to the bright lights of Austin.\\r\\n\u201cMy life was kinda like a scene from Urban Cowboy at that point,\u201d Bell recalls. \u201cI was workin\u2019 construction, sellin\u2019 pizza coupons, shoein\u2019 horses\u2014whatever work I could find to pay the minimum bills of the apartment I was livin\u2019 in. Other than that, I was just screwin\u2019 around and playin\u2019 shows; I\\r\\nhad a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band for a while. Monday nights at the Hole in the Wall was a residency with Ramsey Midwood, Mike and the Moonpies and Leo Rondeau. I was enamored of that honky-tonk scene; they had dollar-fifty High Lifes\u2014that didn\u2019t hurt, either.\u201d\\r\\nWhile in Austin, Bell cut his first album, titling it Saving Country Music\u2014a key formative experience, though few outside of his circle were aware of its existence. Then New Orleans beckoned, and off he went for a six months of further mind expansion\u2014paying particular attention to the performing styles of the city\u2019s adept street musicians\u2014before his pilgrimage led him to Nashville, where he now resides. As Bell was accumulating life experience and serving his apprenticeship in these musical hotbeds, he kept returning to Wyoming to work on the ranch, keeping himself grounded in the most literal sense of the term.\\r\\nNashville was the right place at the right time for Bell, who continued to write and perform, cutting his second album, Don\u2019t Mind If I Do,\u201d in 2014 at the Bomb Shelter, which has become his go-to studio. Rolling Stone noticed, stating that Bell \u201cplays classic honky-tonk with a wink and a yodel that summons the sleeping ghosts of country better than any voodoo spell ever could. Bell\u2019s shows are welcome excuses to click your boots and down an extra sniff of bourbon. And songs like \u2018Sometimes\u2019 are such uncanny time warps they almost make his sets appear in Technicolor.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cSometimes\u201d is one of several tunes from that record that embodies the dynamic of the album and of Bell\u2019s music in general, intertwining life\u2019s highs and lows with poetic concision.\\r\\n\u201cThat song is about when I lived in Austin and I wasn\u2019t really sure that I wanted to,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was sad to leave it, but I also wanted to go out and keep lookin\u2019 around. It\u2019s also about breaking up with someone before you\u2019re sure if you\u2019re ready to, and what happens to you when you\u2019re young and you really care about somebody, but you\u2019re not done exploring, and dealing with those feelings. When you make a change in your life, and you\u2019re thinking about everything you\u2019re going to miss afterwards. There\u2019s your town in the rearview mirror, and you\u2019re kinda torn as you\u2019re exploring a new life somewhere else between what you left behind and what\u2019s in front of you. You\u2019re thinkin\u2019, \u2018Well, I\u2019m kinda havin\u2019 a good time, but then I\u2019m also going home lonely and wondering what the hell I\u2019m doin\u2019. You know, that sort of juxtaposition.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThe Bullfighter,\u201d another linchpin song, gets inside the head of a familiar character\u2014\u201cthe drunken male,\u201d Bell says with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a boasting song about pretending you\u2019re the toughest person at the bar lookin\u2019 for a fight, drunk, and playacting that character over and over again. You see it all the time\u2014somebody that\u2019s swaggering a big swagger, but they\u2019re really just sad. I know, because I\u2019ve been that guy.\u201d\\r\\nThese examples just scratch the surface of this high-revving album, with its dead-honest narratives filled with photographically detailed figures and situations.\\r\\nThis album emphatically puts Luke Bell in the vanguard of traditionally rooted contemporary writer/artists. We\u2019ll be able to ride shotgun with him on his further adventures behind the wheel of his beloved \u201995 Buick LeSabre, because no matter where he goes from here, there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019ll keep telling it like it is.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atjmbo.jpeg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":971},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atjmbo1.jpeg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atlg.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":303},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atlg1.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atmd.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":202},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atmd1.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-og.jpeg\",\"width\":989,\"height\":1000},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atsm.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":101},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atsm1.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-sq.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-sqsm.jpeg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atxl.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":506},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atxxl.jpeg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":657},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/13/97-atxxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.reverbnation.com/fastluke\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/lukebellofficialmusic/?hc_ref=SEARCH&fref=nf\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/lukebellmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"lukebellmusic\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1737865,\"name\":\"Summer Dean\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":957,\"height\":959},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":301},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-og.jpg\",\"width\":957,\"height\":959},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":501},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":651},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/37/49-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://summerdeanmusic.wordpress.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/AmeriTonkMusic/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1319907?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
