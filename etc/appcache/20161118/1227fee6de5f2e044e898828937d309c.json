Green Acoustic\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"When the Randy Rogers Band\u2019s last project debuted as the most-downloaded country album on iTunes, plenty of the industry \u201cinsiders\u201d on Music Row were left scratching their heads: Who are these guys?\\r\\n The Nashville elite may not have known about the five-piece band, but much of America already did. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them alongside such artists as U2 and the Stones in its list of Top 10 Must-See Artists in the summer of 2007. They earned $2.5 million\u2014a staggering total for a still developing act\u2014on the tour circuit in a single year. Willie Nelson, the Eagles, Gary Allan and Dierks Bentley all picked them as opening acts for their concerts. And more than 2,200 people showed up and bought the bands album at an appearance at Wherehouse Music. The fans\u2019 exuberance was shared by USA Today, which praised the band for having \u201cloads of grit, swagger and heart.\u201d\\r\\n  The Randy Rogers Band built its audience by combining forces: It\u2019s a dynamic live act centered around songs that fit the rowdy, party vibe of the concert circuit, but their songs also say something.\\r\\nThat\u2019s particularly true in the new album, The Randy Rogers Band, in which a dozen persuasive tracks give the listener plenty of reasons to want to down a celebratory brewski. But the songs also maintain a depth that makes them powerful and provocative even beyond their edgy arrangements and tough-guy sound.\\r\\n Invariably, the songs are about people making choices and dealing with the consequences they bring. That\u2019s the case in the opening \u201cWicked Ways,\u201d in which a string of wild endeavors leaves an outof-control adult in need of redemption. It\u2019s true in \u201cWhen The Circus Leaves Town,\u201d where a performer comes to terms with the emotional crash that accompanies the conclusion of a pumped-up show. It\u2019s even a tenet in \u201cOne Woman,\u201d a ballad that finds a former playboy recognizing his old choices and behaviors were a shallow pursuit next to the promise and solidity that stand before him.\\r\\n \u201cThese songs are definitely true, and they\u2019re relatable to many different life situations that I\u2019ve either gone through in the past or will go through in the future,\u201d Rogers, the lead singer and primary songwriter, says. \u201cI just tried to create believable characters and relatable characters. I hear from fans that we really have helped them in real-life situations when they\u2019ve applied the songs to their everyday life. That\u2019s what I strive for in the songs that I write.\u201d\\r\\n \u201cWe\u2019re not old, but we are getting a little bit more mature,\u201d bass player Jon Richardson asserts, drawing laughter from the rest of the band. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be more mature, anyway. And that\u2019s something that we can write about a little more naturally now instead of \u2018Here\u2019s a song about how much fun I had\u2019 or \u2018Here\u2019s a song about a girl.\u2019 That\u2019s probably just a natural progression of our own lives being reflected in our songs.\u201d\\r\\n Indeed, the Randy Rogers Band is confronting the same questions about relationships and identity that face many of the college students and young adults that form the centerpiece of the group\u2019s audience. The balancing act between work, home and recreation is a difficult one\u2014even tougher for an ensemble that spends more than 200 days annually on the road. \u201cAll the guys, except for Jon, are married or soon to be married,\u201d guitarist Geoffrey Hill observes.\\r\\n\u201cLes [drummer] and I both have kids. So sometimes it feels like you\u2019ve really gotta struggle to fit all that into your life, I guess, but it\u2019s kinda part of the game. I always said that I play music for free, and I get paid to leave the family behind and go on the road.\u201d  That requires a constant rededication to the group, a commitment the five members have repeatedly made since the current lineup coalesced in 2003.  The Randy Rogers Band\u2019s status as a group has occasionally confused its audience, which sometimes assumes Rogers is simply a solo artist. It\u2019s the same issue that acts such as Huey Lewis & The News and Edwin McCain have battled, though one that doesn\u2019t concern RRB all that much.\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue at all,\u201d fiddler Brady Black asserts. \u201cI think when we got together, Randy had already had a band, and his name had been out a little bit, and so we just kind of went with it.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThat,\u201d Black smirks, \u201cand he owned the van\u2026\u201d\\r\\n Actually, the name came rather innocently. Rogers had developed a following, he played open mic nights, impressing club owner Kent Finlay enough to offer Rogers his own regular night, as long as he found a band to back him.  That group might have taken his name, but Rogers\u2014who\u2019d had previous experiences as a guitar player in another band\u2014had no interest in being just a one-man show. \u201cI always wanted everybody to be equal, not only financially but also input-wise and creatively,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we started the band, I pledged to them that I would work every day as hard as I could and try to get us down the highway a little further if they would sign up with me and share in some of those sacrifices, and I think from that day on, everybody pretty much quit their alternative jobs, and kinda gave 110 percent to the band.\u201d\\r\\nThe Randy Rogers Band took the same slot that George Strait and the Ace In The Hole band had once occupied at Cheatham Street, appropriate since the band used the same sort of inner motivation in building its sound as Strait did a generation ago.\\r\\nTheir music is hardly the same. In contrast to Strait\u2019s pure-country aesthetics, RRB combines that traditional country sound with a rollicking, swagger influenced by rugged sounds from such diverse sources as Waylon Jennings and Stone Temple Pilots. But, as Finlay recognized, there\u2019s an authenticity and honesty to the band that parallels Strait\u2019s personal manifesto.\\r\\n\u201cIn a way, George was a little bit out of the box for Nashville when he debuted,\u201d Rogers notes,  \u201cI think George Strait, when he first hit town, he knew who he was, and I think that\u2019s partly why he has been so successful throughout his career. If there\u2019s a correlation between the two of us, I think that we definitely have a sound and we know who we are.\u201d\\r\\n The Randy Rogers Band further distinguishes that identity in its self-titled album, the band\u2019s second release since signing with Mercury Nashville. Produced by longtime admirer Radney Foster, who\u2019s successfully maintained alt country integrity while writing mainstream hits for the likes of Sara Evans and Keith Urban, sessions for The Randy Rogers Band took place at Dockside Studios, a bayou location in Maurice, Louisiana, that\u2019s also been the breeding ground for projects by B.B. King, Mavis Staples, Keb\u2019 Mo\u2019, Levon Helm and Mark Knopfler.\\r\\n \u201cWe shut ourselves up for 10 days and had a band-camp set up,\u201d Richardson observes. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any distractions. It wasn\u2019t like we were all goin\u2019 home every night and comin\u2019 back the next day. We were just living and breathing it for 10 days or so. We were just completely absorbed by it.\u201d The consequences of that choice are just as absorbing for the listener. The album ranges from the hypnotic country of \u201cBuy Myself A Chance\u201d and the first single, \u201cIn My Arms Instead,\u201d to the propulsive buzz of \u201cNever Be That High\u201d to the painful conclusion, \u201cThis Is Goodbye.\u201d\\r\\n Rogers\u2019 various performances reflect the wide-ranging influences that snapped together in the process, evoking at times the sneer of Steve Earle, the soul of Bakersfield\u2019s Monty Byrom (formerly of Big House) and the vulnerability of Keith Urban. With its infectious hooks and daring attitude, the album underscores the iTunes popularity of the Randy Rogers Band, its critical appeal and its significance on the nation\u2019s concert circuit, where they\u2019ve broken attendance records at numerous clubs across the heartland. Even Kenny Chesney, who consistently places among the top-selling tours, saw the group\u2019s blue-collar connection when he covered Rogers\u2019 \u201cSomebody Take Me Home\u201d for the album The Road And The Radio.\\r\\n Each of the five members recognizes his contribution to the Randy Rogers Band\u2019s overall unity, and they repeatedly make choices\u2014creatively and personally\u2014that keep that all-for-one-and-one-for-all solidarity intact.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":717,\"height\":467},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":717,\"height\":467},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":195},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":195},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":130},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":130},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-og.jpg\",\"width\":717,\"height\":467},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":65},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":65},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":326},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":326},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":423},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/48/83-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":423}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/randy-rogers-band/id27459080\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.randyrogersband.com/home/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/RandyRogersBand\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/rrbchoir\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"rrbchoir\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1384980?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
