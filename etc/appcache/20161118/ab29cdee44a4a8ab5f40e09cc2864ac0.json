The star of Fox Television's monster hit \\\"The X-\u00ad\u2010Files,\\\" David was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series, he was nominated for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his highly acclaimed and some say risqu\u00e9 appearances on THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW. In January 1997, David won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series. He has been nominated for a total of three Golden Globes, three Screen Actors Guild and a TV Critic's Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series. The press and the public both agree that Duchovny brings a fierce intellect, a quiet intensity and an acerbic wit to his roles on both the small screen and the silver screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince THE X-\u00ad\u2010FILES debuted, millions and millions of self-\u00ad\u2010proclaimed \\\"X-\u00ad\u2010Philes\\\" spent their Sunday nights wide-\u00ad\u2010eyed in anticipation as their hero, the brilliant and sullen FBI agent Fox Mulder, explored cases deemed unbelievable or unsolvable by the Bureau. Duchovny's remarkable performance on THE X-\u00ad\u2010FILES earned him the title of \\\"Zeitgeist Icon\\\" by Laura Jacobs in The New Republic and \\\"the first Internet sex symbol with hair\\\" by Maureen Dowd in The New York Times.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid added the role of director to his already extensive list of accomplishments when he wrote, directed and starred in three critically acclaimed episodes of THE X-\u00ad\u2010FILES, titled \\\"The Unnatural\\\", which starred Jessie Martin, and \\\"Hollywood A.D.\\\", starring Garry Shandling and actress Tea Leoni and \\\"William\\\". Other directing credits include the Fox hit series BONES, as well as, 6 episodes of CALIFORNICATION\\r\\n\\r\\nDuchovny's passion for renegade films has brought him critical acclaim for his performances in the feature films KALIFORNIA, in which he costarred opposite Brad Pitt; THE RAPTURE, the controversial film directed by Michael Tolkin in which Duchovny starred opposite Mimi Rogers; and JULIA HAS TWO LOVERS, in which he turned in a much heralded performance as a telephone hustler. Duchovny played Roland \\\"Rollie\\\" Totheroh, Charlie Chaplin's longtime confidante and cameraman in the Sir Richard Attenborough directed CHAPLIN, which starred Robert Downey, Jr. in the title role; and starred in the smash hit BEETHOVEN, opposite Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt, as the evil yuppie determined to take over Charles Grodin's company.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeature credits include the Dreamworks action-\u00ad\u2010comedy EVOLUTION, opposite Julianne Moore and directed by Ivan Reitman, the MGM romantic-\u00ad\u2010comedy RETURN TO ME, opposite Minnie Driver, directed by Bonnie Hunt. THE X-\u00ad\u2010FILES movie, PLAYING GOD, with Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie. David went on to appear in a hilariously funny cameo in Ben Stiller's film ZOOLANDER.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill recognized for his role as Dennis/Denise Bryson, the transvestite detective in David Lynch's reakthrough television series TWIN PEAKS, Duchovny also spent four seasons as the impassioned narrator of Zalman King's erotic anthology series RED SHOE DIARIES, which began as a feature length telefilm for Showtime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, he starred in the Miramax ensemble comedy FULL FRONTAL, for director Steven Soderbergh, co-\u00ad\u2010starring Julia Roberts and George Clooney. David made brief returns to television, first appearing in good friend Bonnie Hunt's show, LIFE WITH BONNIE, in which he guest starred as over-\u00ad\u2010the-\u00ad\u2010top weatherman Johnny Volcano, for which he was nominated for an Emmy in 2003. Following that, he made a memorable appearance on SEX AND THE CITY, as an ex-\u00ad\u2010flame of Sarah Jessica Parkers' \\\"Carrie Bradshaw\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made his feature directorial debut in 2005 with HOUSE OF D which he also wrote and appeared in. The film, which starred Robin Williams and Anton Yelchin, vividly captured the spirit of youth in all its joy and heartbreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther feature credits include TRUST THE MAN, in which he starred again with Julianne Moore and Eva Mendez, THE TV SET opposite Sigourney Weaver and Simon Helberg and directed by Jake Kasdan; the Dreamwork's feature THINGS WE LOST IN THE FIRE, opposite Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro for Susanne Bier; THE SECRET directed by Vincent Perez and produced by Luc Besson ; THE X-FILES:\\r\\nI WANT TO BELIEVE; and THE JONESES opposite Demi Moore and Amber Heard for director Derrick Borte.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid ventured onto the stage starring off Broadway in Neil LaBute's play BREAK OF NOON in which he reunited with his X-\u00ad\u2010FILES: I WANT TO BELIEVE co star Amanda Peet.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, he worked on the independent features GOATS opposite Vera Farmiga, Ty Burrell, Graham Phillips and Dakota Johnson; PHANTOM opposite Ed Harris and the independent feature LOUDER THAN WORDS opposite Hope Davis and Timothy Hutton.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis other long running series CALIFORNINCATION ended its 7 year run this past summer for Showtime. Hank Moody marked another seminal character portrayed by David that has made it's way into our pop culture lexicon and for whose potrayal he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Comedy series.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid recently completed his first studio album for Think Say Records which will be distributed by Caroline, the album will be released in May 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first novel HOLY COW was released by Farrar Straus and Giroux in February 2015 and hit the New York Times Best Sellers list.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis highly anticipated new drama series for Tomorrow Studios /NBC, which he executive produced and stars in, AQUARIUS will premiere on May 28th, 2015 and will immediately release the complete series on premiere day on NBC.com, the NBC app and VOD.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid will begin production on the Fox event series X-\u00ad\u2010FILES in June 2015, reuniting with Gillian Anderson and Chris Carter. The series will be released 1st quarter 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid splits his time between Los Angeles and New York and remains the only actor to have won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Television series in both the Comedy and Drama categories.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":657},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":205},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":137},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-og.png\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1402},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":68},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":342},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atxl1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atxxl.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":445},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/02/61-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/DavidDuchovnyOfficial\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/davidduchovny\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"davidduchovny\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.aladdin-theater.com/event/1378551?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
