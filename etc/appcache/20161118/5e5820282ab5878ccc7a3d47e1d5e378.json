To the world, it's just a street in the home of rock n roll and blues. But to those who really know and have experienced first hand the depths of the city's musical soul, its deep roots in the subgenres that create that feel that people can only describe as the \\\"Memphis sound\\\", there is so much more to its guts. You're driving across the city, in hot pursuit of the kind of sound that shakes you to your bones, that makes you dance, that makes you lust. You find your self on Southern Avenue, as it ties together bits and pieces of the city's culture and history and winds its way to the famous Stax Museum and Royal Studios nearby. You find yourself in the middle of Soulsville, USA. The band that so boldly holds a name like Southern Avenue, does justifiably so as it stirs up a soulful, funky, rock n' roll stew, built on a solid foundation of the blues.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"These are exciting times! In the 6 short months since we have been working together, we have poured numerous hours into writing, touring, and growing as a band, and now, with a fresh new batch of songs and a steadfast sense of unity, we feel we are ready to show the world what we have been working on as we prepare to record our first EP with revered producer and engineer, Kevin Houston (North MS Allstars, Lucero, Patty Griffin, Ana Popovic), this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouthern Avenue is made up of award winning, Israeli born guitarist, Ori Naftaly, vocal powerhouse, Tierinii Jackson, and her younger sister, Tikyra Jackson, on drums.\\r\\n\\r\\nOri Naftaly won \\\"2013 best blues band\\\" in Israel and came to Memphis, TN to compete at the International Blues Challenge on Beale St. Naftaly reached the 2013 IBC semi finals and sold th largest number of CD's ever in the competition's history. That year, Naftaly gained international recognition and support by the blues community and by an extended fan base, by way of extensively touring the US and Holland, and his recordings circulating around the world by radio. His former band, The Ori Naftaly Band, immediately took the blues world by storm, with over 400 shows in over 42 states, including headlining appearances at some of the most well-regarded blues festivals in the country. There, Naftaly shared the stage with some of the best acts in the business, such as Tab Benoit, Ana Popovic, Bernard Allison, Shemekia Copeland, Royal Southern Brotherhood, Ron Holloway (The Allman Brothers), Marcia Ball, Danielle Nicole, and many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSultry, raw, soulful, and most notably, powerful. That's Tierinii Jackson. Raised in the church in the heart of Memphis, TN, and beginning her singing career from childhood as the youngest member in the choir, this preacher's daughter developed the kind of spirit in her voice that can move mountains, and pipes that can blow the roof off a building. There's a hot, hot heat to Jackson's coolness in her impressively expansive range and the emotion that backs it. It's the big kind of voice that catches you off guard, blasting like a firecracker from her petite frame, as her vocals captivate the room. In her adult years, Jackson, who has been compared by critics to the likes of Aretha Franklin, Etta James, and Tina Turner, has starred as lead vocalist in several musical theatre productions, including \\\"Dream Girls\\\", \\\"Spring Awakening\\\", and Disney's \\\"High School Musical 2\\\", to name a few. Recently, she has toured internationally with Todrick Hall, including on his most recent musical venture, \\\"Twerk Du Soliel\\\", as well as with the Hybrid Performace Group, where the multitalented songstress performed as both a singer and dancer. As she continues continues to soar with such ease in her artistic journey with Southern Avenue, it is undeniably clear that there is nothing small about Tierinii Jackson.\\r\\n\\r\\nTikyra \\\"TK\\\" Jackson, is the younger, but no less talented, sister of leading lady, Tierinii. Don't be fooled by her age though, because when it comes to talent, Tikyra has no trouble \\\"holding her own\\\". Raised alongside her siblings in the church, gospel music was her first love and influence. Growing up in such a musically driven family and environment, choosing an instrument (well, in TK's case, multiple instruments) was just a natural first step; and it was at only 9 years old that she first discovered her drive and passion for the drums. With the encouragement of her family and able to hone her abilities as an active member in the church band, the younger Jackson sister spent hours upon hours a day practicing every possible rudiment and skill necessary to master her craft\u2014which many would argue she has already achieved at the young age of 21. The precussion prodigy, now music business major at the University of Memphis, has continued to develop herself as an artist as an active participant in the university's marching band, The Mighty Sound of the South, and in the Memphis Tigers basketball season pep band at games. Tikyra, who was essentially raised amidst some of Memphis's best known artists, states that becoming a part of Southern Avenue and the opportunity to work with some of the city's finest talent, has re-defined and re-invigorated her love for music and performing. It shows. She makes you feel it.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/67/35-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.southernavenueband.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/SouthernAvenueBand/?hc_ref=SEARCH&fref=nf\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/SouthernAveMEM\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"SouthernAveMEM\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1382791?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
