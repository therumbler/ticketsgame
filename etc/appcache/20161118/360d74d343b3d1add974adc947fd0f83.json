Founded in 1996 by singer/songwriter/guitarists Mike Cooley and Patterson Hood, the band have long held a progressive fire in their belly but with AMERICAN BAND, they have made the most explicitly political album in their extraordinary canon. A powerful and legitimately provocative work, hard edged and finely honed, the album is the sound of a truly American Band \u2013 a Southern American band \u2013 speaking on matters that matter. DBT made the choice to direct the Way We Live Now head on, employing realism rather than subtext or symbolism to purge its makers\u2019 own anger, discontent, and frustration with societal disintegration and the urban/rural divide that has partitioned the country for close to a half-century. Master songwriters both, Hood and Cooley wisely avoid overt polemics to explore such pressing issues as race, income inequality, the NRA, deregulation, police brutality, Islamophobia, and the plague of suicides and opioid abuse. As a result, songs like \\\"What It Means\\\" and the tub-thumping \\\"Kinky Hypocrites\\\" are intensely human music from a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band yearning for community and collective action. Fueled by a just spirit of moral indignation and righteous rage, AMERICAN BAND is protest music fit for the stadiums, designed to raise issues and ire as the nation careens towards its most momentous election in a generation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don\u2019t want there to be any doubt as to which side of this discussion we fall on,\\\" Hood says. \\\"I don\u2019t want there to be any misunderstanding of where we stand. If you don\u2019t like it, you can leave. It\u2019s okay. We\u2019re not trying to be everybody\u2019s favorite band, we\u2019re going to be who we are and do what we do and anyone who\u2019s with us, we\u2019d love to have them join in.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMike Cooley is somewhat more direct. \\\"I wanted this to be a no bones about it, in your face political album,\\\" he says. \\\"I wanted to piss off the assholes.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAMERICAN BAND\u2019s considerable force can in part be credited to the sheer musical strength of the current Drive-By Truckers line-up, with Hood and Cooley joined by bassist Matt Patton, keyboardist/multi-instrumentalist Jay Gonzalez, and drummer Brad Morgan \u2013 together, the longest-lasting iteration in the band\u2019s two-decade history. AMERICAN BAND follows ENGLISH OCEANS and 2015\u2019s IT\u2019S GREAT TO BE ALIVE!, marking the first time DBT have made three consecutive LPs with the same hard-traveling crew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This is the longest period of stability in our band\u2019s history,\\\" says Hood. \\\"I think we finally hit the magic formula. It\u2019s made everything more fun than it\u2019s ever been, making records and playing shows.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDrive-By Truckers might have maintained constancy but Hood embraced change by moving his family to Portland, OR in July 2015, a physical shift which he says \\\"opened the floodgates\\\" to a batch of deeply felt, strikingly emotional new songs. Having recorded the bulk of their canon in Athens, GA, the band was also eager to reinvent their own surroundings. Memphis was considered but when DBT\u2019s November 2015 tour wrapped in Nashville, the band decided to spend a few days at the legendary Sound Emporium getting a head start on the new record.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever ones to screw around in the studio, DBT cranked out nine new songs in just three 14-hour shifts, as ever with producer/engineer David Barbe at the helm. Coming in directly from the road put a head of steam behind the band, allowing them to lay it all out live on the floor, tracking songs like \\\"Once They Banned Imagine\\\" in little more than a single take.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We realized we had most of the record,\\\" Hood says, \\\"so we went back after the holidays for four more days, but ended up finishing it in three. We tend to usually take about two weeks to make a record so this was really quick.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That was a lot of fun,\\\" the Alabama-based Cooley says, \\\"and a shorter drive for me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeed was of the essence, as DBT was determined to get their record out at the height of the 2016 election season. By their very nature, Drive-By Truckers has always been an inherently political act, \\\"but this is the first time it\u2019s been out there on the surface,\\\" Cooley says, \\\"No bones about it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I\u2019ve always considered our band to be political,\\\" Hood says. \\\"I\u2019ve studied and followed politics since I was a small kid. I got in trouble in third grade for a paper I wrote about Watergate \u2013 the teacher sent a note home to my parents saying I was voicing opinions about our president that she didn\u2019t appreciate. That\u2019s the one time I got in trouble at school where my parents sided with me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"SOUTHERN ROCK OPERA was a pretty political record,\\\" Cooley says. \\\"But we hadn\u2019t had our first black president yet. We hadn\u2019t sat in the bleachers and watched the backlash, which, as acquainted as we are with racism, went beyond what anyone imagined it would be.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical matters reared their head on 2014\u2019s ENGLISH OCEANS, most explicitly on Cooley\u2019s \\\"Made Up English Oceans,\\\" detailing the life and crimes of late Republican black ops master Lee Atwater. Hood further sharpened his own skills by penning an op-ed for the New York Times condemning the Confederate Flag and its vile role in Southern culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That was a major learning experience,\\\" he says. \\\"Working with an editor, how to streamline what I\u2019m trying to say, how to find the most powerful part and get rid of some of the excess. It was really grueling but I was eager to take it on and learn as much as I could from it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHood delivered a finished draft to the Old Gray Lady and within moments, wrote the ferocious \\\"Darkened Flags On The Cusp Of Dawn\\\" on a borrowed guitar \u2013 his own gear in a moving van on its way to his family\u2019s new home in Portland. The song, like so much of the album, is a direct response to 2014\u2019s police shootings of unarmed African-Americans, a moment both Hood and Cooley see as the catalyst for their blunt new approach. Long haunted by the police shooting of a mentally ill neighbor in his former hometown of Athens, GA, Hood wrote \\\"What It Means\\\" in the heat of Ferguson, Staten Island, and the subsequent emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It was all in my head and just kind of bubbling at the surface,\\\" Hood says. \\\"I think we knew early on that was the direction this record was going to go in.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHood\u2019s friend and collaborator for more than half their lives, Cooley was a on similar trip, reading, writing, and pondering the very same issues that rend the country in two.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We have conversations about all this stuff,\\\" he says, \\\"but not necessarily in terms of planning an album or anything. Then we go home, he writes a song, I write a song, and they\u2019re both basically about the same thing.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We tend to come to the same conclusions separately but together,\\\" Hood says. \\\"We don\u2019t really discuss it until we have a bunch of songs. We\u2019ve always been astounded at how much common ground our songs have, record after record. SOUTHERN ROCK OPERA is the only time we discussed a game plan for what we were going to write, the only time. It\u2019s kind of uncanny. Truly a beautiful thing.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther creative inspiration came from a pair of American milestone pieces of art, Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 National Book Award-winning Between The World and Me and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY, \\\"in my opinion, the greatest musical work of our current time,\\\" says Hood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It\u2019s an inspiring album and one that made me question myself,\\\" he says. \\\"I\u2019m a white guy from the South, do I have the right to be singing about this stuff? What can I do? The only conclusion I could come up with was maybe white guys, with Southern accents, who look like rednecks, need to say Black Lives Matter too. It\u2019s a start, a tiny start, but a step in the right direction is better than no step at all.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I couldn\u2019t not do it,\\\" says Cooley. \\\"I\u2019ve got to speak about this stuff, somehow or another. And I\u2019m going to speak about it from a middle aged Southern white working class evangelical background male point of view.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch like Lamar\u2019s GRAMMY\u00ae Award-winning song cycle, AMERICAN BAND serves as a stark, tightly focused snapshot of today\u2019s America, an exemplary illustration of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll as a vehicle for social commentary and clear-eyed reportage. \\\"Guns of Umpqua\\\" captures Hood\u2019s reaction to the 2015 shooting at Roseburg, OR\u2019s Umpqua Community College while Cooley\u2019s breakneck \\\"Ramon Casiano\\\" is a topical folk rocker telling the little known tale of former National Rife Association leader Harlon Carter and the murder of 15-year-old Ramon Casiano. Known as \\\"Mr. NRA,\\\" Carter transformed the organization from its original role as a sportsmen and conservationist group into what Cooley correctly declares \\\"a right wing, white supremacist gun cult.\\\" A Southern-rooted band opening their album with such a song makes for a singularly powerful statement, the NRA\u2019s monolithic control of the debate demanding opposing artists to be as overt and vocal on the issue as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The NRA needs to be turned into a political turd in a swimming pool,\\\" Cooley says, \\\"so all these fuckers will start paddling away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What I\u2019m trying to do is point straight to the white supremacist core of gun culture,\\\" Cooley concludes. \\\"That\u2019s what it is and that\u2019s where its roots are. When gun culture thinks about all the threats they need to be armed against, what color are they?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course the personal can also be politic, represented here by Hood\u2019s deeply felt \\\"Baggage.\\\" Penned the night of Robin Williams\u2019 death, the song sees Hood examining his own demons and long bout with depression, \\\"the worst I\u2019ve had as an older adult,\\\" he says. \\\"I was kind of blindsided by it. There had always been a tangible thing that I could point to as to what was wrong, but this time I was grasping for something and not quite finding it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAMERICAN BAND is surprisingly optimistic thanks to Hood\u2019s \\\"absolutely\\\" improved mental health as well as Drive-By Truckers\u2019 passion for the issues behind the material. The band intend to hit the road harder than ever in support of AMERICAN BAND, bringing their songs to the people as they have always done, only this time with the country\u2019s very future at stake. Fortunately for America, Drive-By Truckers are, as a Great Man once said, fired up, ready to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I feel like Cooley and I both nailed what were going for on every song on this record,\\\" Hood says. \\\"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a wasted line or word on this record. There\u2019s nothing I would change, that\u2019s for sure. I think we got this one right.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I\u2019m sure there will be people saying \u2018I wish they\u2019d keep the politics out of it,\u2019\\\" Cooley says, \\\"but one of the characteristics among the people and institutions we are taking to task in these songs is their self-appointed status as the exclusive authority on what American is. What is American enough and who the real Americans are. Putting AMERICAN BAND right out front is our way of reclaiming the right to define our American identity on our own terms, and show that it's out of love of country that we draw our inspiration.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJUNE 2016\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":967},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":302},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":201},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-og.jpg\",\"width\":2034,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":101},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":504},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":655},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/01-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.drivebytruckers.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/drivebytruckers\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/drivebytruckers\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/drivebytruckers\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"drivebytruckers\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1710345,\"name\":\"Kyle Craft\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Kyle Craft grew up in a tiny Louisiana town on the banks of the Mississippi, where he spent most of his time catching alligators and rattlesnakes instead of playing football or picking up the guitar. He's not the born product of a musical family, and bands never came through town -- it was only a chance trip to K-Mart that gave him his first album, a David Bowie hits compilation that helped inspire him eventually to channel his innate feral energy into songwriting and rock and roll. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat self-made talent drives every note of 'Dolls of Highland,' Craft's exhilarating, fearless solo debut. \\\"This album is the dark corner of a bar,\\\" he says. \\\"It's that feeling at the end of the night when you're confronted with 'now what?'\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nCraft knows the feeling well -- 'Dolls' began to take shape when everything he took for granted was suddenly over, including an eight-year relationship. \\\"All of a sudden I was left with just me for the first time in my adult life,\\\" he says. He decided to get himself and the music he'd been working on far away from the ghosts of his home in Shreveport, Louisiana, to make a new life for himself in Portland, Oregon, living under a friend's pool table while he demoed new songs and started to tackle his own question about what came next. \\r\\n\\r\\n'Dolls of Highland' crashes open with \\\"Eye of a Hurricane,\\\" a whirlwind of ragtime piano and Craft's dynamic, enthralling vocals. He calls it a \\\"jealous song,\\\" stirred up by the memories of an ill-fated crush and a drama of \\\"weird little connections, a spider web of what the fuck?\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe swinging, resonant \\\"Lady of the Ark\\\" is also tied up in that web, \\\"a very incestuous song,\\\" says Craft. \\\"It's about these messed up relationships, maybe involving me, maybe revolving around me.\\\" Most of the characters and atmospheres on the album come from in and around Shreveport, where Craft briefly returned while recording the album for an intensely productive reckoning with his past. He stayed in a friend's laundry room in the Highland neighborhood, where he recorded the whole album in two months on a home studio rig. \\\"I dedicated the album to Shreveport and called it 'Dolls of Highland' for all the girls and ghosts in town who influenced it so strongly.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nCraft eventually returned to Portland where Brandon Summers and Benjamin Weikel of The Helio Sequence helped refine and mix the album to move it from its DIY beginnings to a more fully realized work. Craft played most of the instruments on the album, but the recorded songs transmit the power of his live performance. \\\"It's just letting go,\\\" says Craft. \\\"I think it's just all about feeling it in your chest.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then there's Craft's unforgettable voice -- \\\"I'm fully aware that I have a very abrasive, very loud voice, but Bob Dylan is the one that taught me to embrace that,\\\" says Craft. \\\"I stray away from him from time to time, but always come back. I don't want to come off as antique, but I also don't want to be afraid of paying homage to the stuff I've always loved.\\\" With those influences as inspiration, Craft's talent and singular creativity move the conversation into new and unpredictable places. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd no question, this album is very much about moving forward. \\\"After everything fell apart, it didn't take very long for me to learn who I was and what I should be doing,\\\" says Craft, who is walking out on the other side with 'Dolls of Highland.'\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/05-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://www.subpop.com/artists/kyle_craft\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://facebook.com/kylecraftmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/kylecraftmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"kylecraftmusic\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.coxcapitoltheatre.com/event/1316951?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
