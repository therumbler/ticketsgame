But it\u2019s textured in a different setting that will also delight a legion of admirers who never knew he could embrace the wide open spaces of American roots music so brilliantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cReinvention\u201d is an overused word in the creative arts, but \u2018Holy Ghost\u2019 overflows with subtle and surprising pleasures, liberal use of pedal steel, Fender Rhodes, mellotron and banjo, and the best songwriting of Ford\u2019s career. It shows off an artist refreshed and refuelled, taking life at a slower pace at home in California these days \u2013 and it\u2019s the next chapter in a unique Anglo-American collaboration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you know Ford\u2019s back story in full, you know it\u2019s about a multi-faceted reputation forged on the frontline as the fabled lead guitarist with the Black Crowes; at the helm of his own bands such as the Neptune Blues Club and the Sinners; as a vital component of key records and/or tours by acts from Govt. Mule to Izzy Stradlin, from Booker T to Ben Harper; and as the producer of choice for artists such as the great roots-rocker Ryan Bingham and English country-soul talents Phantom Limb.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherein lies the transatlantic connection. Ford produced the Bristol-based Phantom Limb\u2019s second album \u2018The Pines,\u2019 released in 2012, and when it was time to give life to the songs he\u2019d collected for \u2018Holy Ghost,\u2019 the inspirational thought occurred to him to offer the return job to the band\u2019s Stew Jackson, aka Robot Club, in sessions at Rockfield in Wales and the Shed in Bath. Jackson plays on the album along with his fellow Limbs, so to speak, while Marc\u2019s son Elijah adds guitars, and his wife Kirsten contributes vocals. Elijah, himself a fine new talent, has also been working with Jackson on his own album project.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI waited for a while until the timing was right for this,\u201d says Ford. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to act on these songs for a while, so I kind of sat on them as a batch together. Most of them are brand new, but a couple are 15 years old. I just needed to drop out for a little bit and get home back together. I had a daughter, so this is the first time I got to be at home for the first five years.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, Ford knew what he had to do. \u201cI was sitting here one day and, like I said, I\u2019d been waiting on these songs for a while. Then it just dawned on me, wait a minute, Phantom Limb is the perfect band for this. I\u2019ve used a couple of bands here, and although I could have made the record with them, it didn\u2019t seem right, there wasn\u2019t the perfect fit. I would have had to tailor some people or some songs, and it didn\u2019t seem to make sense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cSo I just said \u2018Stew, you allowed me to pull your baby apart and put it back together. I\u2019ve never had a producer produce my own stuff. How about payback? You can do me now. I think I have some of the best songs I\u2019ve ever written, and you\u2019ve got a bitchin\u2019 band.\u2019 He just said \u2018Get here.'\u201d\\r\\nThe results are inspiring, often upbeat, always reflective. As Ford himself says, \u201cit\u2019s hopeful, in a dark way sometimes.\u201d But it\u2019s the work of an artist who\u2019s found the inner strength to recharge, personally and professionally. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI pulled out of gigging and travelling and literally kind of stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt was like, \u2018I\u2019ve got to regroup here, be at home and keep relationships good.\u2019 Otherwise, if you keep running and running, even though it\u2019s work, something has to suffer. So the holy grail now is to find how you keep a family and a musical career together. We moved to San Clemente, which is a little surf town, and the pace here is slower. It really is a small town feeling, a lot of acoustic guitar playing. I think all that reflects in the record.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the process of rethinking himself, Ford has learned all kinds of new music, but his earliest memories in the household of his west coast upbringing were of Beatles, Creedence and Simon & Garfunkel albums, and Miracles and Chuck Berry singles. Later inspiration came from Led Zeppelin and Elton John. \u201cAs I got older, I found the first two Jeff Beck records, \u2018Truth\u2019 and \u2018Beck-Ola,\u2019 and wore those out. Then a friend of mine took me to his house, his stepfather had this 400,000 watt stereo and he sat me down and put on Band of Gypsys. It scared me to death, it changed everything for me. I was like, \u2018I didn\u2019t know you could do this.'\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing in a high school band, he left to form his own outfit, in a rock education that would lead ultimately to Burning Tree, the acclaimed LA trio whose powerful local reputation led to a deal with Epic and a 1990 album. Noticed by a bunch of Atlanta scenemakers of the day called the Black Crowes, Ford would join them in 1993 for \u2018The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion,\u2019 which hit No. 1 and sold two million copies in the US alone as they climbed to the top of the world. His guitars were also front and centre of 1994\u2019s \u2018Amorica\u2019 and \u2018Three Snakes and One Charm.\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHis time with the Black Crowes, including a second stint in the mid-2000s, are so well documented as to need little repetition here. Except for Ford to say that he can look back on his musical passage with them, and on all of his other stops along the way, with real satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019m proud of all the music that\u2019s been made,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that stands, and the Crowes was a fantastic band. Ben Harper\u2019s music was great, \u2018There Will Be A Light\u2019 [on which he plays, as he does the later \u2018Both Sides Of The Gun\u2019] is a fantastic record. Ryan Bingham, I heard at a club at one in the morning and it was like \u2018Please let me record you.'\u201d He did so, for Bingham\u2019s lauded Lost Highway albums \u2018Mescalito\u2019 and \u2018Roadhouse Sun.\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThere are a lot of factors involved when you\u2019re in your early 20s and everything you\u2019ve ever dreamed of happens. I got swept up in it, like many people do. There was just a point where I went \u2018Wait a minute, you\u2019ve reached the top of the mountain and the answers aren\u2019t here, this isn\u2019t really any kind of enlightenment I was looking for.\u2019 Drugs and alcohol were a giant cover-up for a lack of self, and worth. So the only regrets I would have would be personal, wishing that I could have handled certain things better. But then again, I had to learn it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2018Holy Ghost\u2019 is absolutely ingrained with all the things Marc Ford has learned. \u201cMaybe people still want me to be a guitar hero and that\u2019s it,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cI\u2019m determined to change that mindset.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n-Paul Sexton\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/74/23-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://marcfordmusic.com/media/marc-ford-and-the-neptune-blues-club/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/marcfordmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/MarcFordMusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"MarcFordMusic\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1771350,\"name\":\"Cris Jacobs\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"After 10 years fronting the Baltimore band The Bridge, Cris Jacobs is continuing to show his depth and range as a gifted songwriter and performer.
