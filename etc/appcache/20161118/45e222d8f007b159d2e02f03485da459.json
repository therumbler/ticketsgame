It\u2019s a question Slow Club\u2019s Charles Watson and Rebecca Taylor must have asked themselves as they started work on their fourth album. From the cute indie-folk of their 2009 debut Yeah So, to the wonky-pop of its follow up Paradise, two years later, to the sophisticated, polished soul of 2014\u2019s Complete Surrender, this is a band that have never stood still, going out of their way to present a new version of themselves on every release, while maintaining the spirit, the warmth and the chemistry that has marked their music since they formed in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet Slow Club 2016 are a very different proposition to the indie duo of a decade ago, who carried makeshift percussion rigs around their native Sheffield in parents\u2019 cars, sang everything in close harmony and wrote from a shared perspective. The pair live in different parts of the country now, and work in very different ways. Charles is in London. Rebecca lives in Margate, throwing herself into the artistic community there. Charles writes obliquely, using short stories and found narratives to transmit his ideas, while Rebecca\u2019s lyrics are starker and more personal, channelling her heartbreak and happiness in a very direct way. How do you bring two distinct styles, two distinct lives, back together and make them feel like the same band?\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently, you send them to Richmond, Virginia for a week.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake no mistake, One Day All Of This Won't Matter Anymore, the duo\u2019s fourth album, is the best thing Slow Club have ever done - their warmest, their most classic sounding, their most cohesive album yet, smoothing those two disparate approaches with a woozy, late-night, candlelit vibe that softens the pop hooks and makes choruses glow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe secret weapon is producer Matthew E. White, the master of Southern-gothic folk, whose in-house band at Richmond\u2019s Spacebomb Studios provided the consistency and tone the album required. On previous records the duo would play most of the instruments themselves, aided by occasional friends. Here they handed their songs to Spacebomb\u2019s core unit: guitarist Alan Parker, drummer Pinson Chanselle, bassist Cameron Ralston and keyboard player Daniel Clarke, encouraging them to develop their parts and help arrange the music. Almost every track was played live in the studio, allowing the long-established session band\u2019s natural chemistry to augment Charles and Rebecca\u2019s, with the double advantage of recording being very effective, and also comparatively quick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt desperately needed that.\u201d says Rebecca, \u201cWe weren't as on the same page about what we wanted this time, we were sort-of blindly going into it. We needed someone to come in and take control. Going in there with those guys leant itself to that. It was perfect.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a completely new way of working for the pair, recalling the great house-bands of the 60s and 70s, like Muscle Shoals\u2019 Swampers or Phil Spector\u2019s Wrecking Crew. \u201cIt felt old school in the sense that we were the writers and Spacebomb were the players\u201d says Charles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt's great. It's taken us ten years to say \u2018What if, right, we get everyone in the same room, and we have the same sound, and we get people who are really, really good to play it?\u2019 Now we've figured it out.\u201d says Rebecca.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe usual tensions of recording dissipated under the calm, laid back, familial atmosphere of camaraderie and creativity White and his band created.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThere were four players in the room: drums, bass, guitar, keys, so a bunch of people in the studio. I think that's why we had such a laugh.\u201d says Charles, \u201cNormally it's just the two of us and whoever we're working with. We might both be a bit knackered, or one of us is more excited about something than the other, but here there was this constant energy because there was always four or five of these guys, and they'd hear something and have this way of going \u2018Oh daaaaamn\u2019.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt was really funny because we're so British and cynical, and we don't vibe but they'd be, like, \u2018Mmmm!\u2019\u201d says Rebecca.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cMmmmm!\u201d is a good way of putting it. \u201cDaaaaaaamn\u201d even more so. One Day All Of This Won't Matter Anymore is a hugely satisfying listening experience, dark but not downbeat, old-school without sounding dated, an album of great feel. You can understand why words like \u201cvibe\u201d were being thrown around the studio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cTo my mind it's warm,\u201d says Rebecca, \u201cthere's this kind of unspoken finesse you get from these guys playing in a room all at once. It's sexy, and downbeat and cruising and dark. Not dark, like a mood, but candlelit. Where-as the last one was spotlights. I still managed to get a bit of spotlight in here, but it's mostly candles. We're getting on a bit, aren't we? We want everything to be warm, and nice, and have a high thread count. I spent \u00a3190 on sheets the other day. Don't print that, my Mum will be livid.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s really slow\u201d says Charles, \u201cI have a tendency to go really slow on everything and it always gets a bit sped up, but for the first time everything on the record is slower than the demos.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI think it's really fucking brave to go slow\u201d, agrees Rebecca, \u201cthere's a confidence in it that, left unattended, we've always shied away from. I'm really proud of that.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this warmth, of all this chemistry, of all this slowness pays off. One Day All Of This Won't Matter Anymore is a late night record. It\u2019s atmospheric and comforting (that\u2019ll be Rebecca\u2019s high thread count) and languid, but never boring. Slow, it might be, but that never feels like a bad thing. Opening track \u2018Where The Light Gets Lost\u2019 pulls its drifting, six-note guitar riff out of the air and it feels like waking from a deep sleep. Ten years ago \u2018In Waves\u2019 shuffling chord sequence would have been delivered at twice the speed with five times the amount of words, but here bathes itself in lap-steel guitar and takes its time, Rebecca\u2019s vocal all space and wistfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWistfulness and acceptance are very much themes here. On \u2018Come On Poet\u2019, a clear highlight, Rebecca, giving one of her best-ever vocal performances, sings about \u201ca chronic impatience, sufferer waiting for time to heal\u2026 Babies taking their lead from elders who still don\u2019t know anything,\u201d while Charles\u2019s Silver Morning is about \u201ca guy who won once and lost it all\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Complete Surrender was something of a breakup album One Day All Of This Won\u2019t Matter Anymore is about learning that, eventually, you have to accept responsibility for your own life - never an easy thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI didn't write anything for ages because it was all just so self-centred and 'God aren't I awful'\u201d explains Rebecca, \u201cI'm so jealous of how Charles can totally remove himself in songs, I did a little of that, but ultimately I had to go with what was coming out of me, and talk myself into using it. I've lived a thousand lives since that last break up, I've also done a lot of looking into myself and sort of building back what had been really fucking broken down. I feel like I'm still at the beginning of really healing and moving on, and becoming someone who isn't a quivering wreck. I'm my own biggest problem now. Which is just as hard.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy contrast Charles songwriting style has become less confessional, and more oblique. \u201cI\u2019ve started work on a collection of short stories called 'Ike Jime Spike'\u201d. He explains. \u201cThe Ike Jime Spike is basically a long screwdriver used by anglers to kill fish quickly and painlessly, but it struck me that it\u2019s more about the humans suffering and seems like a strange thing. In the stories I wanted to explore the relationship between man and nature. Not all my lyrics are directly linked to this theme but I tried to occupy this space when writing. It became easier to say harder things this way.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf all of this seems a little introspective, or in Charles\u2019 case maybe a little intellectual, then don\u2019t worry. At their heart Slow Club are still a pop band and One Day... contains some of the best melodies they\u2019ve yet created. The duo\u2019s knack for writing hooks and melody has, if anything, become stronger. There are choruses here you instantly feel you\u2019ve known your whole life, like \u2018Ancient Rolling Seas\u2019 timeless, reassuring refrain of \u201cI\u2019ll always be by your side\u201d, or \u2018Champion\u2019\u2019s Dolly Parton via-Linda Ronstadt anthem of self-celebration through the darkest times. Perhaps best of all are a pair of songs to be found at the top of what traditionalists would call \u201cside 2\u201d- Rebecca Casanova, a slice of widescreen, four-to-the-floor pop that recalls soft-rock giants Fleetwood Mac in the way it channels heartbreak onto the dancefloor, and Tattoo Of The King, a Charles Watson tale that takes Neil Young and the Doobie Brothers to the disco. Neither sound like anything Slow Club have done before, while still somehow sounding like Slow Club always have. And if that seems like a contradiction, like two ideas saying something different but working together, well that\u2019s Slow Club 2016 through and through.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":614},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":192},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":192},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":128},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":128},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1310},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":64},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":64},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":320},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":320},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":416},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/00/99-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":416}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/80780101&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\\\"><\\/iframe>\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"//www.youtube.com/embed/awGddf1OOvk?list=PLS02rPvIUWwI94HzdBCr8LdA2d_DjZw40\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.slowclubband.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/slowclub\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/slowclub\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/slowclub\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"slowclub\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1722141,\"name\":\"Annie Hart\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Annie Hart is 1/3 of synthesizer trio, Au Revoir Simone and she brings her love of synthesizers and DIY ethic to her self-produced solo project.
