Ranaldo\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"LEE RANALDO\\n\\n\\\"A solo record works best when you feel like you're opening a window into somebody's life, experiencing the things they're going through or thinking about, places they're seeing, through their eyes. At its best, you find a universality in it.\\\" \u2013 Lee Ranaldo\\nOnly those directly in its path know for certain, but there's a good chance that when Hurricane Sandy hit the Northeastern United States in October 2012, it felt like the end of the world. When the storm finally left New York City alone, many residents dealt with destroyed homes and tattered lives but they also received aid from empathetic strangers.\\nLee Ranaldo and his family were among the lucky Manhattanites. but for a week, they had no electricity, running water or heat. He did, however, have an acoustic guitar and, as has been the case of late, some new songs began spilling out of it, reflecting a prolific period imbued with eerie uncertainty.\\nRanaldo had finished work on his last album, Between the Times and the Tides (released March 2012), before Sonic Youth went on hiatus in the fall of 2011. The record followed an informal period of songwriting, borne of acoustic guitar fiddling and more direct lyrics from a poet known for emotive abstraction. His plans to record a low-key acoustic LP soon evolved and many friends (Steve Shelley, Alan Licht, Nels Cline, Jim O'Rourke, Bob Bert, John Medeski, wife/artist Leah Singer) dropped by to conjure a vaguely psychedelic pop-rock sound that served Ranaldo and SY fans well.\\nA core unit came together, getting tighter after some roadwork, and soon Steve Shelley (Sonic Youth), Alan Licht, and bassist Tim L\u00fcntzel became The Dust. The band dug in at Echo Canyon West thru the winter, evolving a new set of songs with a decidedly more group dynamic. Yet even though he was tracking new songs with the band (plus the always-welcome Medeski), Ranaldo wanted to present songs that were even more personal and adaptable to various live contexts.\\nThe songs on this LP are darker, longer, and more intense than those of its predecessor, which was comparably upbeat. Despair and rage ripple through its atmosphere, but are held at bay, never quite able to touchdown. Ranaldo lives near Zucotti Park, which was HQ for NYC's Occupy Wall Street movement. He has visited Occupy encampments in Toronto, S\u00e3o Paulo, and wherever else he can, often bringing his kids with him so they can witness left wing, non-violent democracy in action. Unlike his last record's \\\"Shouts,\\\" there is no specific tribute to OWS, but there is a yearning for some real, societal shift. \\\"Every time I wait for the revolution to come,\\\" Ranaldo sings on \\\"Home Chds.\\\" \\\"Every night I think it\u02bcs here and then it\u02bcs gone.\\\"\\nAt the same time the songs on Last Night on Earth reveal a guarded optimism. The term \\\"hope\\\" has been politically co-opted and devalued but it's a key element on Last Night on Earth. Ranaldo sings of land and water and love and certainty\u2014external life forces that can turn on us at any second\u2014from an exploratory, inviting place of co-existence. When the world ends, we're all in this together, and that's a really beautiful, scary thing.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":701},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":219},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":146},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":748},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":73},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":365},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":475},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/59/41-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.leeranaldo.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/leeranaldoandthedust\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/leeranaldo\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"leeranaldo\"},{\"id\":783789,\"name\":\"Steve Gunn\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Steve Gunn is a New York-based guitarist and songwriter. With a career spanning nearly fifteen years, Steve has produced volumes of critically acclaimed solo, duo, and ensemble recordings. His albums with GHQ and longtime collaborating drummer John Truscinski represent milestones of contemporary guitar-driven, forward music. A voracious schedule of international performances has cultivated a fervent fanbase for Gunn's music throughout the world.\\r\\nMining the catalogs of Basho, Bull, Chapman, and Sharrock, among other titans of stringed-things and record-session royalty, Steve has steadily processed these inspirations into a singular, virtuosic stream. Friendships and collaborations with Jack Rose, Tom Carter, Meg Baird, and Michael Chapman colored the disciplined evolution of the discursive, deconstructed blues sound, at once transcendent and methodical, that is now Gunn's signature. Close listening reveals the influence of Delta and Piedmont country blues, ecstatic free jazz, and psych, as well as Gnawa and Carnatic music, on the continually unfolding compositions.\\r\\nGunn's 2009 solo masterpiece, Boerum Palace, demonstrated a fully realized power for songcraft. Steve started to sing more and developed a commanding vocal style equal to his guitar practice. His acclaimed instrumental duo recordings with Truscinski, Sand City (2010) and Ocean Parkway (2012), cemented his place among the top of his peers, both present and past. These documents display Gunn's compositional penchant for charting musical travelogues that ramble through city and wilderness alike. Dispatches home are not merely descriptive but corporeal; the evocative, rhythmic power of his writing and phrasing carries the listener along bodily. Steve builds songs as exploratory vessels, opens them up for mechanical tinkering, and lives in them through ceaseless improvisatory permutations.\\r\\nParadise of Bachelors is thrilled to release Time Off (2013), his first album as leader of a trio including longtime friends John Truscinski on drums and Justin Tripp on bass, and a record on which Steve's compelling singing features more prominently than ever before. The album features his oblique character sketches and story-songs about friends, acquaintances, and denizens of his Brooklyn neighborhood, using the trio band format to launch his compositions into new, luminous strata. This is Gunn at the top of his game, writing his most memorable tunes and lyrics, utterly unique but steeped in traditions both vernacular and avant-garde.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":641},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-og.jpg\",\"width\":1444,\"height\":964},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/01/81/95-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://steve-gunn.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/therealstevegunn/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1776603,\"name\":\"Meg Baird\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"MEG BAIRD IS BACK! Don't Weigh Down the Light is her first album since 2011's Seasons On Earth, and it arrives alive with mystery and color \u2014 buoyed by a voice that's a warm, mesmerizing call across time.\\n\\nMeg Baird's last decade would be remarkable by any artist's standards. She co-founded and recorded three albums with Es- pers \u2014 one of the most distinctive and hypnotic bands of the cen- tury's first decade. She recorded two solo LPs for Drag City: Dear Companion and Seasons on Earth. She also collaborated with Will Oldham, Kurt Vile, Sharon Van Etten, and Steve Gunn and toured with the legendary Bert Jansch.\\n\\nAnd while it's been four years since her last release, the days since have been anything but restful. She played drums and recorded with Philadelphia cave punks Watery Love, and toured with Michael Chapman, Michael Hurley, Vile, Cass McCombs, Hiss Golden Messenger, and Lambchop. And after more than a de- cade as a fixture in Philadelphia's boiling-over musical scene, Meg moved west to San Francisco where she joined forces (as drummer and lead vocalist) with members of Comets on Fire and Assemble Head to form the moody and thunderous Heron Oblivion.\\n\\nShe also wrote and recorded this LP \u2014 Don't Weigh Down the Light.\\n\\nLike Meg's previous LPs (and much of Espers output,) the foundation of Don't Weigh Down the Light is her lyrical, precise, and propulsive fingerstyle guitar work and a voice that moves from soaring and tender to soothing and spellbinding. A voice that more than a few have likened to folk's greatest female voices: Sandy Denny, Jacqui McShee, and Shirley Collins.\\n\\nBut where Dear Companion and Seasons on Earth were relatively minimalist affairs, Don't Weigh Down The Light is multi-hued and swimming in texture. Electric guitars and organs float and dart around Meg's intricate picking and voice like ghosts. Distant drums thump as heart- beats. Piano and electric 12-string guitars shimmer like sunlight on rippling, crystalline seas.\\n\\nDon't Weigh Down The Light is also a record of its time and place \u2014 recorded in a city desper- ate to remain a haven for dreamers, freaks, and weirdoes while a new Gilded Age rolls over the land like a flood. So it's a record that finds Meg casting a cautious sideways glance \u2014 questioning sweet talkers and promises of easy illumination. It's also a loving embrace \u2014 and a reverent saluta- tion \u2014 to the sunshine-melancholy artistic traditions of California and the City.\\n\\nFor all the moods and quiet elegance on Don't Weigh Down The Light there is nothing too precious or immaculate in the production. It was recorded at Eric Bauer's Bauer Mansion studio: more famous for producing fuzzed-out and unhinged work from Six Organs of Admittance, Ty Segall, Mikal Cronin, and White Fence.\\n\\nThe studio's informal setting was a perfect match for the stew of pop-song architecture and impressionistic moods that are the backbone of Don't Weigh Down The Light. Songs forged from Meg's deep, natural Anglo-Appalachian instincts and wed to the deepest, most longing sounds of Skip Spence and Ben Chasny, Virginia Astley's pastoral abstractions, Opal's dusty, paisley West, Gene Clark's Byrds-era torch ballads, and Popol Vuh's dreamscapes.\\n\\nInevitably, some songs reflect the solitude of leaving and arriving anew. But there's also a sense of strength in friendship and home, with lyrics full of affection, care and guidance. And in spite of that wry, wary, sideward glance at power and promises, they are a plea to live, to thrive, and to stick around. A reminder that we need the dreamers \u2014 even if it's wake-up time.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":803},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":251},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":167},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":857},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":84},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":418},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":544},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/54/13-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.megbaird.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/pennsylvaniawildlife\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Meg-Baird/106169829414486?\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/meglingbaird\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"meglingbaird\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1382311?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
