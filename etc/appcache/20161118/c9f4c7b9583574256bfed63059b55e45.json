KWahtro\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Those who\u2019ve followed Keller Williams\u2019 recording career to date know that he has given each of his albums a single-syllable title: FREEK, BUZZ, SPUN, BREATHE, LOOP, LAUGH, HOME, DANCE, STAGE, GRASS, DREAM, TWELVE, LIVE, ODD, THIEF, KIDS, BASS, PICK, FUNK, and most recently, VAPE (released April 20, 2015). Each title serves not only as a concise summation of the concept guiding the particular project but also as another piece of the jigsaw puzzle that is Keller Williams. GRASS, for example, is a bluegrass recording, cut with the husband-wife duo the Keels. STAGE is a live album and DREAM the end product of a wish list: Keller collaborating with some of his greatest musical heroes. THIEF is a set of unexpected cover songs. And KIDS offers up, you guessed it, Williams\u2019 first and possibly only children\u2019s record.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe naming trend continued with 2012\u2019s BASS and PICK, respectively a set of songs where Keller plays bass and William\u2019s collaboration with royal bluegrass family The Travelin\u2019 McCourys. With VAPE, released in April 2015 \u2013 Keller celebrates his 20th official album release. What all of the titles reveal, when taken together, is an artist of great stylistic breadth and infinite imagination, a singer, songwriter and musician, always on a quest for the new. Keller Williams has never followed the prescribed path laid out by the conventional music business, nor has he taken the prescribed meds laid out by his team of conventional doctors. Instead, he has taken the A.D.D. path (Artistic, Determined, Dedication). It\u2019s a path that has served him quite well.\\r\\nSince he first appeared on the scene in the early \u201990s, Williams has defined the term\\r\\nindependent artist. And his recordings tell only half the story. Keller built his reputation initially on his engaging live performances, no two of which are ever alike. For most of his career he has performed solo. His stage shows are rooted around Keller singing his compositions and choice cover songs, while accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. With the use of today\u2019s technology, Keller creates samples on the fly in front of the audience, a technique called live phrase sampling or looping, With nothing pre-recorded, the end result often leans toward a hybrid of alternative folk and groovy electronica. A genre Keller jokingly calls \u201cacoustic dance music\u201d or ADM.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat approach, Williams explains, was derived from \u201chours of playing solo with just a guitar and a microphone, and then wanting to go down different avenues musically. I couldn\u2019t afford humans and didn\u2019t want to step into the cheesy world of automated sequencers where you hit a button and the whole band starts to play, then you\u2019ve got to solo along or sing on top of it. I wanted something more organic yet with a dance groove that I could create myself.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams\u2019 solo live shows\u2014and his ability to improvise to his determinedly quirky tunes despite the absence of an actual band\u2014quickly became the stuff of legend, and his audience grew exponentially when word spread about this exciting, unpredictable performer. Once he began releasing recordings, starting with 1994\u2019s FREEK, Williams was embraced by an even wider community of music fans, particularly the jam band crowd. While his live gigs have  largely been solo affairs, Williams has nearly always used his albums as a forum for collaborations with fellow musicians. An alliance with The String Cheese Incident on 1999\u2019s BREATHE marked Williams\u2019 first release on the band\u2019s label SCI Fidelity Records, an imprint he still partners with today for recordings. DREAM, Keller\u2019s 2007 release, found him in the company of such iconic musicians as the Grateful Dead\u2019s Bob Weir, banjo master B\u00e9la Fleck, bass great Victor Wooten, American musician/poet Michael Franti and many others. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThat album took, from start to release time,\u201d says Williams, \u201cabout three years. The object was to get people that I admire musically to play my stuff, so when I\u2019m old I can crank this album in my pimped-out golf cart and have something that I\u2019m really proud of. I was going for the historical effect for my own personal listening pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cEach record,\u201d he continues, \u201cis a little snapshot of history. I like to think of it as a period piece for an artist. Each record is a little bit different but all of them have some kind of common thread, which is my musical ability as far as I can take it. I enjoy making records. In some people\u2019s eyes, they\u2019re a dying breed, but I\u2019m very passionate about it. They document where my head is at that time in my career and where I am in my songwriting.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams\u2019 story begins in Fredericksburg, Virginia, just south of Washington, D.C. There he was exposed to a wide variety of music at an early age, starting with country and bluegrass and working his way up through hip-hop and go-go, a brand of funk particular to that part of the country. Once he began playing guitar, Williams\u2019 sphere expanded to what he calls \u201cthe post-pseudo-skateboarder punk-rock rebellious type of thing, Black Flag and Sex Pistols and\\r\\nRamones, Dead Kennedys, things like that. That slid into the more melodic college rock, like the Cure and the Cult, the Smiths, R.E.M.\u2019s first five or six records.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nThen came the Grateful Dead, a seminal influence on Williams\u2019 own music. \u201cI studied and learned their music and went to the shows,\u201d he says, adding that the impact of Jerry Garcia on his attitude toward music remains incalculable. Another major influence was Michael Hedges, the late virtuoso acoustic guitarist. \u201cHe was really excelling in a whole different world from what I knew,\u201d says Williams.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter relocating to Colorado, further exposure to bluegrass music and progressive acoustic artists such as B\u00e9la Fleck and the Flecktones also had a major impression on Williams. As he began to develop his own distinctive compositional and performing style, Williams incorporated all of the lessons he\u2019d learned from the long list of artists who\u2019d found their way into his world, then filtered their music through his own experiences until something wholly unique emerged. The list of artists whose music he has covered either in concert or on his recordings constitutes a mind-blowing spread: songs originally performed by everyone from Pink Floyd and Ozzy Osbourne to Ani DiFranco and old-school rappers the Sugar Hill Gang! \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he first started out, Williams played in regional bands but also performed as a solo artist, \u201cme sitting on a stool playing covers, like a happy hour situation,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d get dinner and maybe tips. There were bands in high school and in college. But it turned out I  could get the same money playing solo that I was getting with the band. Around that time I was also doing temporary jobs and I was making the same amount playing music as I was scraping mortar out of the cracks of cinder block walls for eight hours in the summertime at minimum wage. So it seemed like the obvious choice was to play music. I started to work and over the years I incorporated more technology. The looping thing started to happen and tickets were sold and people came to shows, so there wasn\u2019t any reason to fix something that wasn\u2019t broken.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Williams calls \u201cthe looping thing\u201d is actually a big part of what has made him such a compelling live performer. \u201cBasically, I have these machines that are essentially delay units,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat I do is step on a button and sing or play something. Then I step on  he same button in time and it repeats what I just played or sang. Once that initial loop is created, I can layer on a bass line or a drum line and then have this layer that I just created in front of an audience that I could sing over and solo over. Nothing is pre-recorded. Everything is created onstage in front of the audience.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nIf it sounds complicated, it is: but the basic thrust is that the technology has allowed  Williams to go out on tour week after week, year after year, and play music by himself\u2014without limiting his sound to what we most often associate with the solo singer-songwriter: a guy strumming a guitar and singing. With his arsenal of tech toys, Williams can expand his reach onstage by, in essence, jamming with himself. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut these days, Keller also performs often with live humans. The summer of 2010 found Keller sharing a bus with two of his biggest heroes, former Grateful Dead drummers Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart, as a member of their powerhouse assemblage the Rhythm Devils. \u201cThat was a very surreal experience,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe rehearsed for a few days and then we were on a bus with 12 people, two of them being the original drummers from the Grateful Dead.\u201d In 2013 and 2014, Keller also performed with Dead bassist Phil Lesh as part of Phil & Friends. \\r\\n\\r\\nWilliams has also toured as part of a string trio with singer/guitarist Larry Keel and his wife, singer/bassist Jenny Keel, hitting key stops on the bluegrass festival circuit. And he has a band of his own, with Keller on rhythm guitar and vocals, Jeff Sipe on drums, Keith Moseley on bass and Gibb Droll on lead guitar. They toured throughout the spring of 2007 to the fall of  2008, and subsequently released a double live record with a companion DVD. In true Keller Williams fashion, it\u2019s called Live. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf it seems as if this is a man who never stops, that would be about right. Keller released the amusingly titled THIEF\u2014his all-covers project with the Keels\u2014early in 2010, and KIDS, his sixteenth album, in the fall of that same year. A father of two himself, Williams was, of course, inspired by his own offspring but, he says, some of the songs were written before his children were born. \u201cWhen Not For Kids Only by Jerry Garcia and David Grisman came out, I knew that there was hope for me with kids music,\u201d he says. \u201cI was really attached to that record.\u201d The songwriting for Kids, Keller says, \u201cwas not necessarily singing to the kids. A lot  of it was me singing from the perspective of the kids. That was my plan, to get on their wavelength, on their level, and be one of them, so it\u2019s kind of like one of their friends singing to them.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, BASS found the multi-instrumentalist only playing bass guitar. BASS was also the first album to be recorded with Keller\u2019s live reggae-funk band Kdubalicious, which in addition to Keller on bass and vocals, features Jay Starling on keyboards and Mark D on drums. On the other end of the spectrum \u2013 but just as tasty \u2013 is Keller\u2019s 2012 release PICK. This collaboration featuring Keller Williams with The Travelin\u2019 McCourys is a classic case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts\u2014although the parts are rather massive on their own, to be sure. \u201cPerforming with The Travelin\u2019 McCourys is one of my favorite things to do in the world,\u201d Keller explains. \u201cThis project has struck a special chord with me [pun intended]. It is very addictive.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, Keller always enjoys working with a band. In 2014 he stepped out with his 6-piece funk band dubbed More Than a Little, which draws from the Richmond, VA R&B/gospel scene including a pair of show stealing female singers. The resulting album, FUNK, is a sexy live recording that pays deep homage to the genre\u2019s roots. \\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Keller Williams\u2019 20th official album release, VAPE, finds the prolific singer/songwriter/guitarist offering up 10 original tracks \u2013 some road tested and some brand new. With a hugely successful career spanning two decades under his belt, the music on VAPE somehow finds Keller more confident delivering his signature, often off-the-wall storytelling. Backed by a variety of fellow musicians including Samuel Grisman/bass, John Kadlecik/guitar, Ronnie   Coury/mandolin, Rob McCoury/banjo, and others \u2013 Keller\u2019s playing has never been more precise and versatile. And as if all of this doesn\u2019t keep him busy enough, Keller\u2019s thirst for music of all kinds has also led him to the world of radio. For the past several years he has hosted Keller\u2019s Cellar, a weekly syndicated program available on both terrestrial stations and online at www.kellerwilliams.net. Williams describes the show as \u201ca self-indulgent, hour-long narrated mix tape of stuff I\u2019m into. It\u2019s rule-less except for what the FCC says we can\u2019t do. I don\u2019t play contemporary country music. I don\u2019t play contemporary Christian music\u2014 however, there is possibly some old gospel. I don\u2019t play opera. Everything else is fair game. World music from all around\u2014African music from all the countries, jazz, funk, reggae, techno, chill, lounge, lounge singers, rub-a-dub, dancehall. I pretty much stay away from smooth jazz. It\u2019s definitely a fun outlet for me. I\u2019m trying to do something different.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nSomething different. That, we can assume, is how it will always be with Keller Williams.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":639},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1363},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/85-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://kellerwilliams.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/kellerwilliams\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/kellerwilliams\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/KellerMusician\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"KellerMusician\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1640281,\"name\":\"Zach Deputy\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"On his new release Another Day (Eusonia Records, 2011), Zach Deputy demonstrates his extraordinary ability to perform and record in multiple contexts and conveys the sensibilities of a mature singer/songwriter. Another Day offers another look at Zach Deputy and seeks to help him cross over into other audiences. Rich with ballads and mid-tempo songs, the music on this recording is best described as soulful rhythm and blues, with flavors of Al Green, Taj Mahal and Stevie Wonder emerging in the swells, changes and modulations of the music, in the voice and even in the lyrical content. The record will appeal to fans of contemporary artists like Jack Johnson and Amos Lee, but the origins of the style and feel remain classic.\\nRecorded over 5 days in August 2010 at Mission Sound Recording in Brooklyn, NY, Another Day is the truest example of pure musicianship. As heard in this recording, Grammy winning producer Scott Jacoby and his team of musicians demonstrate that large budget recordings and \\\"over-production\\\" are simply not necessary. Drummer Graham Hawthorne (Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon, David Byrne), bassist Al Carty (Lou Reed, Alicia Keys, Gavin DeGraw) and pianist / organist Will Buthod (Jay-Z, Swizz Beatz, The Harlem Gospel Choir) and Zach Deputy met for the first time on day one of recording and\u2013 despite their diverse backgrounds\u2013 instantly clicked with each other and created the perfect landscape to support Zach's songs.\\nIn contrast to the music and feel of Another Day, Zach Deputy has made his mark thus far as a touring powerhouse. As a boy, the music of his Puerto Rican, Cruzan and Irish heritage was cooked up in the South Carolina heat. The Calypso rhythms and folk songs of St. Croix competed with the R&B / soul of pioneers like James Brown and Ray Charles for space on the family stereo. As Deputy honed his craft, a unique hybrid of these influences emerged, ultimately creating the signature Zach Deputy sound. To bring this sound to the stage, the big, impossibly upbeat South Carolinian with the infectious smile puts on a solo show\u2013 enhanced by looping technology\u2013 that is essentially a one man dance party offering up what he calls \\\"Island-infused, Drum 'n' Bass, Gospel-Ninja-Soul\\\" to the enthusiastic crowds of dancers who flock to clubs from coast-to-coast. It is these late night dance parties\u2014 more than 250 per year\u2013 that have made Zach Deputy one of the hottest up-and-coming performers on the camping festival circuit and \\\"jam band\\\" scene. For Zach, most days begin in a hotel room and end a couple of hours after walking off stage. The constant touring and the compelling live show may be the key to Zach's success on the road, but it is an unlikely inspiration for Another Day, as there is little similarity between what fans have come to expect from Zach and what is offered up in this new record.\\nThus, Another Day is an appropriately titled album, and it is truly an album in the classic sense\u2014 a collection of songs that come from the same time and place, inspired by the same muse. Reflective and introspective, it provides a glimpse at the soul of an artist and the depth of a songwriter. Full of hope and anticipation of the promise of another day, a new day, it is a pivotal point in the career of a touring musician. Whereas it is a departure for Zach Deputy, it is one that he feels confident his fans can relate to, but it isn't the end in itself. Deputy's multi-faceted diamond gets one side polished in this offering, and it is a side that will shine brightly for a new audience.\\nIn April 2016, Zach released an album called Keep on Movin' under the name Zach Deputy & the Hashtags. \\\"Keep on Movin' is a turn-around point in my career. All I expected was a jam session, with maybe a cool take or two, but to my astonishment in only two afternoons at the boat house, we produced an entire record and inspired the birth of a band.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":410,\"height\":354},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":410,\"height\":354},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":259},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":173},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-og.jpg\",\"width\":410,\"height\":354},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":86},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":410,\"height\":354},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":410,\"height\":354},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/09/67-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":410,\"height\":354}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.zachdeputy.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/zachdeputy\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/zachdeputy\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/zachdeputy\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"zachdeputy\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.granadatheater.com/event/1259385?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
