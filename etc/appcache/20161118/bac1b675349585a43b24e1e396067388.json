A naturally charismatic DJ with a back catalogue of standout productions, Joseph is an instinctive performer with a genuine enthusiasm for entertaining. Widely regarded as one-to-watch since making his production debut in 2007, Capriati's rise to prominence has been relentless. Established as a key artist for Adam Beyer's Drumcode label; resident at Marco Carola's 'Music On' events in Ibiza; a priority artist for global festival brands Awakenings, Time Warp, Monegros, Tomorrowland and Kazantip; and a firm favorite with club crowds across Europe and North & South America; Joseph Capriati is a unique artist within the electronic scene, whose powerful performances and musical magnetism spontaneously attract affection from fans and peers alike, marking him out as a leading light amongst the next generation of international techno headliners.\\n\\n2013 was a landmark year for Joseph Capriati. Not only did he release his sophomore 'Self Portrait' album on Drumcode, but the inspirational Italian lit up marquee events across the globe including Berghain Berlin, Space Miami, Pacha New York, Output New York, Stereo Montreal, Cocorico Riccione and Cavo Paradiso Mykonos, plus a festival-hopping summer schedule and a truly magical Ibiza season. Having made his debut for Marco Carola's vibrant Music On brand in summer 2012 with six memorable sets (including the closing party) in the legendary main room of Amnesia, Capriati completed a euphoric eight-date residency for Music On in 2013. However, Capriati's 2013 Ibiza season didn't stop there with a headline set at the Amnesia Opening party and two show-stopping appearances for Circo Loco at DC10 completing his schedule. All this comes on top of a series of impressive firsts, including closing the main room of the internationally respected Time Warp Festival in Mannheim; an all-conquering coast-to-coast tour of USA; a marathon 12-hour set in front of a sold-out 7000 capacity Metropolis club in his home town of Naples, and invitations to play back-to back sets with Marco Carola, Danny Tenaglia, Adam Beyer, Dubfire and Dave Clarke. It therefore comes as little surprise to even the most casual observers of Techno that Joseph Capriati's name now appears as top billing at the most high profile events worldwide. Acknowledged everywhere he goes as an ambassador for the new techno cohort, Joseph is adored by his rapidly growing army of dedicated fans for his honest and humble approach to his art.  \\n\\nWith a path laid out before him and the force of momentum behind him, Joseph Capriati welcomes the future with excited anticipation. \\\"I just want to make music or play gigs everyday. It is the most important thing in my life. When I am in the studio or on stage I feel disconnected from the world and I enter another dimension where there is just the music, the people and myself. I could be sick, or be feeling sad about something, but when I'm playing I totally forget everything and this makes me happier. Looking at the people dancing and following my musical trip is an amazing thing. There is nothing better than this for me.\\\" So the future for Joseph Capriati is simple. Keep on doing what he loves and do it with a passion and commitment that has proved so potent a driving force to this point.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://josephcapriati.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/JosephCapriatiOfficial\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/josephcapriati\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"josephcapriati\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1358973?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
