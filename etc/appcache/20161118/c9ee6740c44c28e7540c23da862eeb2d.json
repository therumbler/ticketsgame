Now, on their fourth studio album Crush, drummer Adam Deitch, guitarists Adam Smirnoff and Eric Krasno, bassist Erick \\\"Jesus\\\" Coomes, keyboardist Neal Evans, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet player Eric Bloom deepen that sound by channeling the sonic freedom and infectious energy of their incendiary live show.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Lettuce and Co- Produced,  recorded/mixed by Joel Hamilton at Brooklyn's Studio G, Crush first came to life on the road, with the band developing new material and testing it out live as they toured. \\\"We've all noticed that our music goes into a lot of different directions onstage, and we wanted to capture that in a way that we never really have before,\\\" says Coomes, who names classic psychedelia and '90s hip-hop among Lettuce's key inspirations on Crush. \\\"It's definitely more wide-open in terms style, but it still stays true to the funk.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe follow-up to 2012's Fly, Crush finds Lettuce brilliantly infusing their psychedelic and hip-hop sensibilities into bass-heavy funk. With its spidery guitar work and hypnotic beats, \\\"Phyllis\\\" is a delicately sprawling epic that embodies what Deitch refers to as \\\"a chill-hop vibe that's kind of the flip-side of all that powerful uptempo funk that people might expect from us.\\\" On \\\"Get Greasy,\\\" Lettuce give a nod to the groove-fueled EDM subgenre known as future funk, building off its highly danceable rhythm with a blissfully loose and horn-laced arrangement. And on \\\"He Made a Woman Out of Me,\\\" guest vocalist Alecia Chakour lends her bluesy growl to a scorching take on Bobbie Gentry's 1970 country-soul classic.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether paying homage to Led Zeppelin on the fiery and guitar-driven \\\"Silverdome\\\" or delivering a deeply riveting and richly textured hip-hop medley with \\\"Oresteia,\\\" Lettuce maneuver through Crush's kaleidoscopic sound with sophisticated ease and powerful synergy. \\\"More so than any of the records we've done before, this album is very much about the improvised grooves and improvised solos,\\\" says Krasno. \\\"Instead of going at it like, 'Here's a melody, now here's a guitar solo, here's another melody, here's a sax solo,' everyone's leaning on each other in a way that's completely unspoken. It's all of us moving as one unit and creating this new sound together.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Lettuce, that sense of unity and togetherness has much to do with a camaraderie that's only intensified over the lifespan of the band. Formed in 1992, when several band members attended a summer program at Boston's Berklee College of Music as teenagers, Lettuce was founded on a shared love of legendary funk artists like Earth, Wind & Fire and Tower of Power. After returning to Berklee as undergrads in 1994, Lettuce started playing in local clubs and steadily built up a following that soon extended to cities across the country and then throughout the world. Releasing their studio debut Outta Here in 2002 and its follow-up album Rage! in 2009, the band dedicated the coming years to balancing their frequent touring with involvement in a host of other musical endeavors (including Evans and Krasno's role as founding members of acclaimed soul/jazz trio Soulive).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, Lettuce have watched their fanbase expand as they've hit bigger and bigger stages and earned their name as a can't-miss festival act. And in making Crush, the band had no trouble harnessing the spirit of their explosive live show. \\\"Some of these shows we've played over the past couple years have been so amazing, it's like you go home a different person,\\\" says Coomes. \\\"I'm sure remembering those moments in our minds and our hearts helped bring out something special when we were recording these new songs.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nSo while Crush offers everything from all-out party jams to headphone-ready journeys into space funk, each track was born from an unabashed joy and love of live performance. \\\"That energy we get when it's prime time and we're about to go onstage and we're just excited beyond belief\u2014that all came out on this new album,\\\" says Deitch. \\\"There's a feeling that the band is rising, and it's a really beautiful thing.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":641},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1367},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/13/03-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.lettucefunk.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/lettucefunk\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/LettuceFunk\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/lettucefunk\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"lettucefunk\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1773683,\"name\":\"Jaw Gems\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Jaw Gems, an electronic outfit from Portland, Maine, is a collective of young, experimental producers bringing beat-music \u2013 traditionally programmed and played on samplers \u2013 to a live band setting. The mesmerizing result is a harmonic convergence.\\n\\nCombine legendary beat-makers like J Dilla and Flying Lotus with indie rock and electronic icons like Deerhunter and Washed Out, then add Radiohead's dreamy ambience and you begin to approach the sound of Jaw Gems.\\n\\n\\\"Dilla is the common thread for how we all met and began playing together,\\\" says keyboardist Hassan Muhammad. \\\"Not many people in Portland knew about him seven years ago, so through various friends we were all pointed out to each other and we were blessed with the opportunity to hold a weekly residency at a bar, playing all the stuff we liked and getting increasingly weird.\\\"\\n\\nSince their start in 2009, the band has been exploring sonic and rhythmic ideas that emphasize interlaced melodies and heavy grooves. First outfitted solely with dueling vintage synthesizers, a drummer, and an electric bassist, Jaw Gems have now incorporated a Roland sp404 and the Juno 106 analog synth, going on to employ the beat- repeating, sample-warping technologies of the present to help create their wall of sound. Armed with new gear, Jaw Gems were able to evolve their beats, trigger intricate samples, and alter sounds in an increasingly advanced way. \\\"You can do so much with these devices, and we all have our own ways of using them,\\\" says bassist Andrew Scherzer.\\n\\nThis August, Jaw Gems will release their second album, HEATWEAVER, via STS9's\\n\\n1320 Records. The 14-tracks create a thickly layered transcendental auditory world \u2013 a meticulously crafted collection grounded in a modern electronic aesthetic. HEATWEAVER melds neck-breaking, hip-hop synthesizers and nostalgic atmospheres, while simultaneously touching on elements of psychedelic funk, neo-soul, and punk rock.\\n\\nJaw Gems likes to keep their recording process relaxed to allow for creative diversity.\\n\\nSetting up shop in a makeshift home studio, the band hunkers down and lets their songs come to life. \\\"We like to make a retreat out if it,\\\" says drummer DJ Moore, noting that all of the musicians have been involved in other projects. \\\"Making music is how we chill, and the album naturally unfolded once we were all committed to being in the same place together for some time.\\\" The title itself came from thinking of the album visually. \\\"We thought about what images the music evoked throughout the whole process, and when someone said \\\"heat weaver,\\\" we all felt it embodied our sound,\\\" he says.\\n\\nPut four beatmakers in a room together for a week, and the outpouring of ideas could be endless. \\\"As we develop as individual musicians each of our sounds morph and evolve in different ways, so when we come together to record we all bring something new to build upon,\\\" Moore says. \\\"Our creative process is never the same,\\\" says keyboardist and sampler Quist. \\\"We tend to refine our ideas in rehearsal, figuring out how to play them as a band, but most of our ideas start off as a beat one of us made. On HEATWEAVER, we let some of our beats stay in a more bedroom beat format, and others we revamped to sound a lot more live.\\\" In this case, Jaw Gems was left with a solid compilation attesting to their evolution as tenacious genre-bending producers. \\\"Jaw Gems have done the magic trick of delivering a thoroughly listenable instrumental album that you can also sing along to,\\\" says electronic musician Daedelus.\\n\\nPerhaps it's this uninhibited sound that has also attracted the likes of other notable musicians. T3 of J Dilla's Slum Village calls HEATWEAVER \\\"mad fresh.\\\" Lettuce drummer Adam Deitch says, \\\"The swing that J Dilla made famous on an MPC beat machine in the late '90s is embedded in Jaw Gems' musical DNA, just as much as soul and funk. They have created a psychedelic, jazz-rooted, West African feeling.\\\"\\n\\nLyle Divinsky of Colorado's The Motet has declared them his \\\"new favorite band\\\" and describes their sound as \\\"a completely unique brew of hip-hop, jazz, funk, avant-garde, and classical music, steeped in originality and psychedelia.\\\"\\n\\nSince the release of their debut album, Blades Plural, Jaw Gems has gone on to share stages with icons such as STS9, Lettuce, and Daedelus. The band also emphasizes matching their work with video. Some examples include Akai Floss, which reached over 7,000 views independent of any label or premiere.
