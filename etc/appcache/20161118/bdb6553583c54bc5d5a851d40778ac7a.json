have always been good at imagining the end of the world,\u201d wrote Rebecca Solnit, \u201cwhich is much easier to picture than the strange sidelong paths of change in a world without end.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe future won\u2019t look like the past: dystopian dread takes this for granted, but utopian imagination is just as valid. Future Politics, Austra\u2019s third, and most ambitious album to date, calls for radical hope: \u201ca commitment to replace the approaching dystopia,\u201d says Katie Stelmanis, who leads Austra with the support of Maya Postepski (Princess Century, TR/ST), Dorian Wolf, and Ryan Wonsiak. \u201cNot just hope in the future, but the idea that everyone is required to help write it, and the boundaries of what it can look like are both fascinating and endless. It\u2019s not about \u2018being political,\u2019 it\u2019s about reaching beyond boundaries, in every single field.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFuture Politics, a collection of urgent, but disciplined anthems for dancefloor and headphones, asks each of us to remember that apocalypse is not an inevitability, but the product of human decision-making. It aims for a world without borders, where human compassion and curiosity drive technological innovation rather than profit, where the necessity of labor is replaced with time for creativity and personal growth, and the terror and destruction wrought by colonialism and white supremacy is recognized as a dark age in human history. The album is radicalism distilled: to galvanic beats, gorgeous, kinetic melodies, and the vulnerable majesty of Stelmanis\u2019s voice. \u201cFuture Politics,\u201d with its steady, propulsive beat and siren-like synth hook, is both anthem and ultimatum: we have a duty to imagine better, and to imagine big.\\r\\n\\r\\nStelmanis, wrote, produced and engineered the album, with Maya Postepski adding production on half the tracks. It was mixed by Alice Wilder, the band\u2019s live engineer, and mastered by Heba Kadry in New York. But its haunting first single, \u201cUtopia,\u201d is heart-filling, irresistible pop that feels pulled from the air. \u201cFreepower\u201d deals with the paradox of a physical world in peril while our collective consciousness evolves\u2014there is no denying our reliance on each other and the systems we invent. \u201cTo solve the problems of global capitalism,\u201d Stelmanis says, \u201cyou need to think on the level that global capitalists are thinking.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking Future Politics was a process of starting from zero. Austra\u2019s debut, 2011\u2019s Feel It Break, and 2013\u2019s critically celebrated Olympia, were followed with five years of non-stop touring, and half a decade without a fixed address. Katie settled in Montreal, where she found herself alone, facing both a language barrier and the dissolution of a few faith-sustaining relationships, romantically and within the band. \u201cI knew writing this record would have nothing to do with music at first,\u201d Stelmanis says. \u201cIt needed to have a purpose other than just my own ego.\u201d The album\u2019s center suite, \u201cI\u2019m a Monster\u201d through \u201cAngel in Your Eye,\u201d is about the intersection of personal depression and collective despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespair can be paralyzing, but it can act as a compass\u2014the less you can ignore, the more you have to act. \u201cI had a process of overcoming my own cynicism,\u201d Stelmanis says. \u201cI came to a whole bunch of philosophers and economists who were writing about real possibilities for reinventing society.\u201d Texts that took a realistic approach to climate change and economic disaster, while offering real alternatives: Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work by Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams; Naomi Klein\u2019s This Changes Everything; David Harvey\u2019s Rebel Cities. The album\u2019s opener, \u201cWe Were Alive,\u201d is about \u201covercoming apathy\u2014becoming more political, and more earnest.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Stelmanis moved to Mexico City, where the album was completed. (The cover art was photographed at the Cuadra San Crist\u00f3bal, Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n\u2019s famous equestrian estate.) \u201cIt was an invigorating, and creatively liberating time\u2014I was entirely immersed in the culture, and in the magic realism of Mexico\u2019s rich and violent history,\u201d Stelmanis says. \u201cEconomic disparity is a huge topic of conversation every day in Mexico, as is colonialism and neoliberalism, and how NAFTA fucked over Latin America. Reading about this history and contrasting it with the white capitalist theory I had learned in school made the issues I was reading about in Montreal feel more global, and feel bigger.\u201d The album\u2019s final track, \u201c43,\u201d is about the 43 students disappeared in Iguala, Guerrero in 2014, written from the perspective of a mother who is searching for her son.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mexico, Stelmanis was introduced \u201cto a whole generation of Latin American producers who are mixing traditional folk music with techno beats. It\u2019s an underground revolution rooted in the preservation and celebration of Latin American indigenous cultures, and also Latin American independence from the USA\u2014very similar to what A Tribe Called Red is doing in Canada.\u201d Inspiration also came from European club culture\u2014Objekt, Peter Van Hoesen, Lena Willikens, and \u201890s legends like Massive Attack; in all, artists who understand the dancefloor as a source of radical ideas and radical joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nStelmanis\u2019s music has always had a political charge\u2014after high school she performed in the riot grrrl band Galaxy, with Postepski and Emma McKenna\u2014but this \u201chas become more important as I\u2019ve gotten older. I\u2019ve experienced more sexism in my industry, I\u2019ve witnessed the downfall of the middle class, I\u2019ve lived through George W. Bush and Stephen Harper.\u201d (Her latest album credits only women as producers, mixing and mastering engineers.) This is a reversal of the clich\u00e9 that radicals get more conservative with age. If you\u2019re old enough to have seen both the nightmarish and the fantastical become ordinary, but young enough to imagine the rest of your life, the more radicalism seems like common sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nChange, Solnit writes, comes from \u201cwriters, scholars, public intellectuals, social activists, and participants in social media\u201d\u2014also \u201cartists, club scenes, parties, teenagers, ghettoes,\u201d says Stelmanis. \u201cEvery single person\u2019s idea about the future is valid and relevant, especially the freaks and the queers and the outsiders.\u201d This is DIY on a global scale: the ethos of a self-made, self-determining culture, but with global imperatives. \u201cTo change the cultural landscape\u2014which is what we do as artists\u2014is to essentially change the mainstream.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1329},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":415},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":277},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-og.jpg\",\"width\":1479,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":138},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":692},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":900},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/08/26-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.austramusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/austra\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/austraofficial\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/stelmania\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"stelmania\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1766829,\"name\":\"The Range\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Potential is the new album from producer James Hinton under his alias of The Range.\\r\\n\\r\\nHinton made the computer his primary instrument after falling under the spell of Baltimore club, bringing in his broader sonic influences from early \u201890s jungle, early \u201800s grime and mid \u201800s electronica to a new sonic whole.
