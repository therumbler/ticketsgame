This offering from the band finds songwriter, Tim Cohen at a crossroads. It was written and recorded during a year that split his time between two lives, in two worlds. The newer of these was on a horse ranch in the northern Arizona desert where he and his partner spent their first year with their newborn daughter. The second of these two was the music world. The latter took place on the road, on tour with Magic Trick or with the Fresh & Onlys. And in the case of Other Man's Blues, it took place for one week at Phil Manley's Lucky Cat Studios in San Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nTim arrived at the studio with a color-coded composition book of songs he'd been writing while bouncing to and fro. This book would have to suffice in lieu of rehearsal time with the 13 other musicians who appear on the tracks. About half of the tracks feature James Kim on drums, the other half James Barone (Beach House). Alicia Van Heuvel (Aislers Set) and Paul Garcia split time on bass. Joel Robinow (Once and Future Band / Danny James) contributes on keys. Emmett Kelly (The Cairo Gang / The Muggers) provides a couple stunning guitar solos. There are omnipresent vocal harmonies from Alicia, Noelle Cahill and Anna Hillburg, the latter of whom also plays some trumpet. San Francisco standbys Dylan Edrich, Tom Heyman, and Marc Capelle all contribute. It was a loose, largely improvised affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album's roster is less the product of grand ambition, and more the result of an open-door policy at the studio. These sessions also served as an opportunity for Tim to hang out with friends while in town. He'd see who was around, they'd swing by. Allegedly tequila was centrally involved. A \\\"hit the joint and come up with a bit\\\" approach. \\\"Here's a chord chart. Go.\\\"  And guest appearances are more than just a little icing on top here. It's the principle that warranted giving this project a band name five years ago: when Tim's non-onlys oeuvre stopped being credited to Tim Cohen and instead was attributed to Magic Trick. Especially in the case of Other Man's Blues, the players on the album define what shapes these songs take.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it's a wide variety of shapes you'll find on this album. Take this less as a conscious display of versatility (although it does demonstrate Cohen & Co.'s ability to shape-shift) and more as a result of the freewheeling, haphazard recording environment described above. A ghostly choir of female voices open the album like a seance. And the spirit they conjure proceeds to flit about over the course of the ensuing ten tracks, animating various stylistic forms, from the baroque pop of \\\"Forest of Kates\\\" to the icy post-punk of \\\"I Held the Ring.\\\" There's the air-tight R&B groove of \\\"Startling Chimes,\\\" the krauty \\\"Purest Thing,\\\" a jammy side-to-side trot that moves \\\"First Thought\\\" along, taking a detour into country before culminating in a glorious Grateful Dead indebted coda. But throughout, it's Tim's lyrics that are pushed to the front of the mix. This album is a display of solid songwriting - collectively fleshed out, but from Tim's composition book, and with Tim's lyrics about family and about himself. These songs are the sound of his friends helping him suss through the conflicts of his new dual existence as father and musician, between old self and new.\\r\\n\\r\\nMagic Trick's 2013 offering, River of Souls, opens with Cohen asking, \\\"Should we live from the mirrors other side?\\\" Maybe, what you have here on Other Man's Blues is an attempt to do just that. You can hear that his scope is widening, is being forced to widen by his circumstance. These songs are full of empathy. They reckon with notions of sacrifice and devotion, acknowledge the \\\"winds of desire\\\" and admit that \\\"musings come from below\\\" like a force of nature. Our protagonist is mid-transformation or maybe even pre-transformation. He is able to \\\"regard his gruesome self\\\" only because he is becoming a new man. Both sides are present. Which is the Other Man? Who is Tim Cohen? What is this magic he is trying pull off? Is it a trick? Or true sorcery? Either way, he must evolve.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":638},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1361},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":332},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":332},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":432},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/10/05-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":432}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/apzZBXuH564\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://timcohen.bandcamp.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/timmycohen\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/magictricktheband/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/magictrickband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"magictrickband\"},{\"id\":962535,\"name\":\"Sweet Chariot\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Sweet Chariot is a San Francisco and Oakland based band with members who prefer old gear and cold beer.

From an early age Kai Clark felt the pressure of such unreasonable expectations, but has always followed his own path in life, not one that had been projected on to him by anyone else. If Kai were to ever become a musician, it would happen naturally, on his own terms. When the time was right.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cMy father never wanted me to become a musician,\u201d says Kai. \u201cMaybe it was because he thought he could shelter me from the music business and didn't want me to live that life.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nBut as all musicians know, the pull to play music, once felt, is profound and inexorable. For Kai, who grew up in Mendocino, California, that moment came just before he entered his teenage years.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cI think I was around 12 when I first learned a couple chords and would pick up an old guitar that used to sit in our living room when no one was around. For some reason I was drawn to the blues and could play and make up lyrics of my own to the chords and rhythm. I started carrying that old guitar around when I went to school and it started to become a part of me.\u201d Kai\u2019s first electric guitar was a 1973 sunburst Fender Stratocaster \u2013 a treasured gift from his mother on his 15th birthday, which he plays to this day.\\r\\n \\r\\nSoon thereafter, Kai followed his instinct.  Having learned to sing and play at the same juncture, the impulse to write songs felt natural.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cMy mom says I would sit on the couch and write these songs about love and life and she would wonder where it came from, as I was too young to have any experience in those matters,\u201d says Kai.  \u201cI guess it was always part of me. Something deep in my soul that I \u2013 like my father \u2013 was probably born with.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen Kai turned 17, certain painful realities, including family illnesses and his father\u2019s untimely death in 1991, served to push him deeper into the solace offered by music.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cThere was a fire inside me and music seemed to quench it,\u201d he says. \u201cMy band and music became my family, my healing guide. Times were tough and I don't think I would have made it through without music. It literally saved my life!\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nBut in 2003, Kai\u2019s life took an abrupt change.  Again, following his own path, not one foisted upon him by anyone, he enrolled in the prestigious California Culinary Academy in San Francisco \u2013 an affiliate of Le Cordon Bleu \u2013 and graduated with honors in 2004.\\r\\n \\r\\nThree years later, however, he discovered that music was again calling him.  He returned to Southern California to play gigs and record with the Kai Clark Band, but in 2010 he put family first, went on hiatus and moved back to Northern California to raise his two children with wife Amber.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Kai Clark Band\\r\\nKai\u2019s music is pure Americana, and combines elements of blues, country and rock, with a wide range of influences that include Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Jimi Hendrix, Taj Mahal and Keb Mo.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe brief hiatus from the music business now over, Kai looks forward to resuming his career with the renewed passion and energy that comes from the peace of having followed his own path, in his own time.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cI never stopped playing and writing,\u201d says Kai. \u201cHaving children has definitely inspired me with music and in life in general. I feel like I\u2019m writing and playing the best I ever have and am really excited about getting back into the studio and out on the road to do live shows.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nHe has also come to terms with his father\u2019s legacy. Musicians who also happen to be the progeny of famous rock stars often try to avoid direct association or comparison with their parents\u2019 achievements. This arises out of a fully understandable desire to have their talents assessed on their own respective merits. Kai Clark will always be the son of Gene Clark, founder member of The Byrds, but he has also embarked upon a musical career that both openly embraces his father\u2019s legacy, while simultaneously furthering his own unique vision.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cI have a better knowledge and respect for my father\u2019s music,\u201d says Kai.  \u201cI love playing his songs \u2013 which I never really pursued much in the past, mainly because of my own prolific writing. No matter where life will take me from here, I will always write and play music. It is as much a part of me as the blood that runs through my veins.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nTom A.
