wouldn\u2019t be hard to make the argument that rock and roll in its purest form is pretty much a teenage fantasy writ large. Like a blacklight poster sprung to life, the lure of picking up a guitar that will transform your adolescent bedroom into an arena filled with screaming fans and pot smoke is the myth that keeps rock and roll forever young, and it\u2019s a kind of dream narrative that has keeps getting re-told, whether it\u2019s The Byrds\u2019 \u201cSo You Want To Be A Rock-N-Roll Star\u201d or about half the tracks on Weezer\u2019s blue album, the burning adolescent desire to nothing less than fucking rock is the very thing that makes rock music a constantly renewable resource\u2014and it\u2019s also what makes Radkey\u2014a trio of power riffing brothers\u2014such a classic kind of rock and roll phenomenon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormed in the quiet enclaves of St. Joseph Missouri, the trio of 20 year-old Isaiah Radke (bass), 18 year-old Solomon Radke (drums), and 22 year-old Dee Radke (vocals/guitar) began making music together in 2010. Fueled by a steady diet of Nevermind and small town boredom, Radkey\u2019s music quickly went from a bedroom hobby into a full-time pursuit. The band opened for Fishbone in 2011 \u2013 less than a year after first playing together \u2013 and eventually headed out on the road to play shows with the likes of Red Fang, Against Me, and Touche Amore. Given that the band members were homeschooled (and thanks to their incredibly supportive parents), the idea of jumping in the family van and hitting the road gradually morphed from a kind of surreal fantasy into a much-celebrated reality. In 2013 the band unleashed two EPs (Cat And Mouse and Devil Fruit) and knocked out tons of big-ticket live appearances (including Riot Fest, Download, and, in 2015, Coachella and Japan\u2019s Punksping) in addition to taping a memorable spot for Later with Jools Holland. Though early press on the band often focused on their unconventional backstory\u2014a rock band comprised of three homeschooled African-American teenagers from Missouri\u2014the band\u2019s backstory was always eclipsed by their incendiary live sets: balls-to-the-wall garage punk that is messy, explosive, and crazy loud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe last couple of years have been really crazy,\u201d says Isaiah, the group\u2019s most outspoken member. \u201cTraveling in England in Europe was really cool for us. It\u2019s incredible\u2014and such a weird feeling\u2014that you are doing something that is actually important to people. To travel to other countries and see people singing along with us is just\u2026it\u2019s really strange. I never thought our music would become a thing that could take us to all of these places.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter nearly five years of playing and touring together as a band, all of the Radkey\u2019s hard work comes full circle on Dark Black Makeup\u2014the band\u2019s full-length debut. Recorded primarily in the UK alongside producer Ross Orton (Arctic Monkeys, The Fall, Jarvis Cocker), the album is a blistering punk opus\u201413 tracks that show off the band\u2019s knack for combining stadium-sized riffs with surprising pop sensibilities. Tracks like \u201cLove Spills\u201d and \u201cEvil Doer\u201d rank among some of the best\u2014and hookiest\u2014songs the band has ever written, while tracks like \u201cLe Song\u201d and the album\u2019s title track show just what an unstoppable live juggernaut the band has become. The songs are both tightly wound and explosively huge-sounding \u201cWe wanted to show people that you can still make a proper rock record,\u201d explains Isaiah, \u201cSomething that is both super catchy and super heavy. We want people to hear it and think Fuck Yeah! Mostly we just try and only write songs that we love\u2014that we love the shit out of\u2014and that way it never gets boring and it never feels like a drag to play them live even if we\u2019ve been playing them for years. It seems like a simple thing, but we really just want to make the music that we want to hear.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDark Black Makeup tackles more than a few teenage tropes\u2014boredom, anger, girl problems, broken friendships\u2014but does so in a way that is not only clever, but also refreshingly honest. No where is this more evident than on the record\u2019s title track, which itself is a kind of high-decibel wake up call for young people to take ownership of their own lives: a sort of punch in the face for teen angst that is made all the more visceral coming from three musicians just barely out of their own teen years. \u201cThat song is about how much of your teenage years can just be such a waste,\u201d says Isaiah, \u201cIf you spend all of your time not caring about anything just because you think you\u2019re not supposed to then you\u2019re probably leading such a boring life. You could be partying or making something, as opposed to just spending all your time worrying about what other people think. It\u2019s like, wake up. Hang out. Do something. It\u2019s annoying that you can\u2019t necessarily change the fucking world at that age, but you can make your own situation better. Stop wasting time\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFive years in and the brothers Radkey are happy to be making a musical statement that will hopefully put to rest a few of the preconceptions that have followed them throughout their career thus far\u2014namely those based around their age, their hometown, and race. \u201cSurprisingly that\u2014the racial thing\u2014hasn\u2019t been a factor for us,\u201d says Dee. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s never been about that. Mostly we get given a hard time about our age, but that\u2019s also something we can\u2019t really change. We might walk into a venue and feel like people are taken a little bit by surprise when they see us, but usually after we play all of that stuff kind of goes away. We get a lot of questions about being brothers\u2014like, do we argue?\u2014and it\u2019s a good question I guess, but the answer is no, we don\u2019t really argue very much. And yes, we all write the songs together\u2014everyone writes\u2014so it\u2019s not a thing we really spend too much time thinking or talking about it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ambition of Dark Black Makeup is evidenced by the heightened songwriting and broadened sonic palette, but the energy behind the music remains the same\u2014visceral, urgent, and raw. It is the sound of three people doing what they love\u2026loudly. \u201cOur only ambitions have ever really been to make a record that people will love and to be able to play as many shows as we can,\u201d says Isaiah, \u201cIt\u2019s also a personal journey. We\u2019ve been living this for years now. This is literally all that we do and the record is the evidence of that. I stop and think, man I\u2019m 20 years old and I\u2019ve been doing this since I was basically 14. We\u2019re still making the same kind of music we were when we started, but we\u2019re better at it now. Thankfully, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to actually go out into the world and experience some real shit, which gives us something to write about now. We just want people to listen. And play it really loud.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":641},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1367},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/00/53-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"2exIQQxe8i4\",\"title\":\"Radkey - Love Spills (Official Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2exIQQxe8i4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2exIQQxe8i4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.radkey.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/radkeyband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1747391,\"name\":\"The Fame Riot\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The Fame Riot is not a band; it's a religion.
