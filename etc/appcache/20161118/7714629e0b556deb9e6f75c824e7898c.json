On a steamy day in Austin, Texas at Yellow Dog Studios, there was a reverent hush that made it feel like a sacred service was underway. When the studio door opened, a song tumbled out. \\\"Better get right, before the Lord gets ready,\\\" a Gospel-drenched refrain; deliberate and soulful stuff. Through the glass, The Departed was playing live, facing each other in a circle, with Steve Littleton on Hammond B3 in a separate room, and Seth James singing with a world weary voice in the booth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guys came back into master control to listen to the track with co-producer Adam Odor. They all were looking down at their respective electronic devices while the music was on. Adam whispered that Cody Canada and The Departed were making a straight up rock record this time around, tapping into the eternal emotions and sonics that have informed the great American musical styles from the start. That album is called Advent\u016bs, the Latin word for arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Advent\u016bs album is fourteen tracks deep. The band members, Cody Canada, Seth James, Jeremy Plato, Steve Littleton, and new drummer Chris Doege, have never had the luxury before of starting the recording process with so many songs. They have worked collaboratively, bringing thoughts, phrases, verses and riffs together. This project, in fact this band, is a testament to the creative process. It is about playing what you want with whom you want, carving out a road family fueled by mutual appreciation for each other's talent as well as the camaraderie.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdam Odor put the process in perspective, \\\"The Departed had the last year and a half to lock in, to find out who they are and what they are together. That's the way they did it in the old days, when a band would get signed to a label. The A&R guy (Artist and Repertoire) would let them tour for a year or so, before he took them in the studio to record. That is what is happening with The Departed. These guys are all so good, the musicianship and the songs, and that is a rare thing when you have them both.\\\" Cody explained further, \\\"For this album, we were ready to roll. When we started practicing there was the feeling that we are honored to be doing this together. Doing other people's songs for the first album, This Is Indian Land, gave us time to let the new stuff percolate. There are some really intricate songs, and so far, we have only played a couple of them out in public.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCody Canada was 16 years old when he arrived in Stillwater, Oklahoma. He found a creative nirvana of musicians who planted seeds that would stay with him for the rest of his life. Cody recalls, \\\"I met Tom Skinner, Scott Evans, Bob Childers, Jimmy LaFave, Mike McClure, the Red Dirt Rangers and they were all playing this really, really good music. It was kind of in that same vibe as the Allman Brothers and The Band. But what came out of it was really diverse. There were more country acts like Jason Boland. The All American Rejects were the rock guys. Then you had the whole Red Dirt hippie thing\u2026I didn't even know what Red Dirt was until somebody told me. I got turned on to it all and it's stayed with me ever since.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada was front man for Cross Canadian Ragweed for fifteen years, where he tapped into those influences for their nine albums, four of which charted on Billboard's Top 10 Country Albums Chart. They sold over a million albums and played to sell-out crowds, bringing the term \\\"Red Dirt\\\" to the nation. When Cross Canadian Ragweed decided to part ways, Cody resurfaced with a mission in mind, to pay homage to the Red Dirt writers and music that were formative. The Departed's first priority was getting into the studio and cutting the Oklahoma tribute album that Cody had wanted to do for years. This is Indian Land came out last year, a 15-track \\\"buffet of really kick-ass Okie songs,\\\" Canada noted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so a seamless transition was made, Cody Canada and his long time Ragweed band mate, Jeremy Plato on bass and vocals; along with Seth James on guitar and vocals (Seth James Band, Ray Wylie Hubbard), Steve Littleton on B3 organ and keys (Live Oak Decline, Stoney LaRue & the Arsenals, Medicine Show) and Chris Doege on drums (Seth James Band, Nashville touring acts). The band members have known each other for years, and they know each other's musicianship. They are excited to be playing together, stoked about the new beginning that their first studio album of original material provides.\\r\\n\\r\\nCody Canada & The Departed continues to hit the road hard. As excited as they are about their gigs, they are taking it all very seriously. Canada continues, \\\"Now it's a new band playing new songs so we've got to learn everything, get our game together and practice. It's a whole lot of fun. I can't sleep at night. It keeps me awake, not from worry but from excitement. We're just ready to tear it up.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCody Canada, Jeremy Plato, Seth James, Steve Littleton, and Chris Doege embrace the future with Advent\u016bs. The music rocks, shimmers, simmers; amplified by the heat of the Texas sun. Advent\u016bs signals the arrival of The Departed.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atjmbo.jpeg\",\"width\":764,\"height\":509},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atjmbo1.jpeg\",\"width\":764,\"height\":509},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atlg.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atlg1.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atmd.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atmd1.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-og.jpeg\",\"width\":764,\"height\":509},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atsm.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atsm1.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-sq.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-sqsm.jpeg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atxl.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atxxl.jpeg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/49/17/69-atxxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thedepartedmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Codycanadaandthedeparted\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/departed_music\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"departed_music\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1767245,\"name\":\"Dalton Domino\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"There's a perfectly natural reason as to why Dalton Domino's debut LP, 1806, carries a varied and skillfully unpredictable quality to it. Domino is filled with the wandering spirit of a storyteller that's never content with simply drawing from the tales of others. Over his life, he's lived in a number of places, some of them such as Frisco, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada, might as well be on different planets for all of the contrasts a perceptive fellow like Domino can tune into. Though he's also lived in Alabama and Mississippi, a couple of states with a rich musical heritage to rival most states, Domino says Lubbock, Texas, no matter where else has laid his head or worked a job, has been, and always will be home. \\n\\n\\\"I was born in Memphis, and I've lived in several spots,\\\" explains Domino. \\\"But I seem to move every five years, and Lubbock is the place I lived the longest, so that is where I'll always call home.\\\" \\n\\nAnother key driving factor to Domino's ability to expertly proffer a number of styles that still feel cohesive and thoughtful on 1806 is in the musical upbringing he enjoyed. Whether it was the hymnal singing from his Grandmother, or the 1950's Sun Records his Grandfather would play, Domino soaked it all in \u2013 even the heavy metal his own step-\u00ad?father would often listen too. Indeed, Domino's formative youth was somewhat unusual, and as a result, his musical choices of the past, might seem strange, given the powerfully grizzled way he can deliver a sage line of West Texas wisdom now. \\n\\nWhether it's gothic western of \\\"Howl,\\\" the rocking roadhouse vibe of \\\"Dallas,\\\" the sawdust shuffling, rootsy ode to an inspirational women \\\"Jesus and Handbags,\\\" or the menacing, swampy, stomping \\\"Killing Floor,\\\" the tunes on 1806 fit well, and offer the listener a well-\u00ad?rounded, satisfying experience. For good measure, \\\"All that Matters\\\" is suited for country radio with its delicate electricity, declarations of a pleading lover, and Domino's ability to simply tell a story we can all relate to, yet can't express in the same way. \\n\\nTwo key moments as Domino traveled the oft-\u00ad?difficult path from adolescence into his teenage years proved to be the foundation from which he would build his identity as a musician with something personal and unique to say. Even in Junior high, Domino recognized music was the way in which he could best express what his soul wrestled with. \\n\\n\\\"A big musical moment for me was in 2003, when I went to a punk show in Las Vegas,\\\" Domino clearly recalls. \\\"New Found Glory and MXPX were playing, which was perfect because I had grown up skateboarding and hearing the live bands at the Van's Warped Tour. Punk music really was my base, because I loved the freedom of the lyrics. The songs dealt with the stuff that was relevant to me. The older I've become, the more I've enjoyed that same freedom I see in the writing of so many great Texas and Red Dirt artists. The feeling I get from great lyrics is what will has always stuck out to me.\\\" \\n\\nShortly after Domino's punk-\u00ad?tinted epiphany, his Grandfather passed away, and at the age of 14, Domino began to explore the depths of personally vulnerable songwriting in order to cope with the loss of the man that had raised him for the first 10 years of his life. \\n\\nOver the years, Domino has kept the fuel for creating original music from his own viewpoint burning on high. With musical heroes ranging from Lubbock legend Terry Allan, to Bright Eyes, to another young singer-\u00ad?songwriter with West Texas ties, Charlie Shafter, its clear Domino wants his music to hit the listener in both the gut and the mind, just as his favorite artists' best tunes always manage to. \\n\\n\\\"Every song I have was about a specific moment or a period of time,\\\" Domino explains. \\\"I can't just make up a song. I have to live in it, or I have to relive the emotions I felt in my life at the moment the song requires.\\\" \\n\\nDominos tragic and triumphant travels through musical and geographical terrain have led to this moment where he's a man with serious things to say, as music is the one true way he can fully express it all to us.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.daltondomino.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/DaltonDominoMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/MrDaltonDomino\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"MrDaltonDomino\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1379265?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
