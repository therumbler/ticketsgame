His youthful energy and attention to song structure and melodic content elevates him above the rest. He entertains both the eye and the ear as he magically transforms the steel string guitar into a full orchestra via his use of altered tunings, tapping, partial capos, percussive hits and a signature two-handed technique.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcKee's crossover success has helped him to achieve millions upon millions of YouTube viewers, underscoring his emergence as one of today's most unique and influential artists. He has been featured as a cover story in both Acoustic Guitar Magazine in the U.S. and Acoustic Magazine in the UK, and is also the figurehead of the unique Guitar Masters tours. McKee's tour dates have taken him through Europe, Asia, Australia and North America, including tours with legendary acts including Prince and Dream Theater.\\r\\n\\r\\nLive performances of Andy's have become a point of fascination with his loyal followers. So, in late 2015, Andy decided it was time to release a live album. Featuring tracks from his entire catalog, Live Book was recorded live in December 2015 at The Melting Point in Athens, GA, the Red Clay Music Foundry in Duluth, GA, and Workplay in Birmingham, AL. McKee went through the recordings from all three shows and selected the finest takes of each set. Reflecting on the song choices, he looks to provide current fans the chance to relive their favorite shows, and hopes that he can showcase the energy he creates for those who haven't been able to attend a show and new fans alike.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I've always wanted to do a live album; for quite a few years I've felt it's something that has been missing from my collection of releases,\\\" says McKee. \\\"This album will feature some of my YouTube hits like 'Drifting' and 'Rylynn', some songs from my 2014 EP Mythmaker, and a cover of a Michael Hedges song called 'Because It's There' played on harp guitar that I haven't released yet.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMcKee is the first artist to be signed CGP Sounds, the record label founded by fellow guitarist Tommy Emmanuel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm honored to be a part of his label. I heard Tommy 15 years ago at a festival in Kansas and was blown away by his playing and performing, and I still am,\\\" Mckee stated. \\\"To be the first person on his label is surreal, and I'm excited and proud to be a part of it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLive Book released worldwide on April 22. The album, McKee's first live record, was released through CGP Sounds. In support of the new album, McKee is now embarking on \\\"The Next Chapter Tour\\\" throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information on Andy McKee please visit www.andymckee.com\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":683,\"height\":1024},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-og.jpg\",\"width\":683,\"height\":1024},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":975},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/72/69-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.andymckee.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/andymckee2\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/andymckeemusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/therealmckee\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"therealmckee\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1260911?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
