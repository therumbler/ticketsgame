When faced with that decision, Portland, Oregon born, bred, and based artist Madgesdiq (Antoine Stoudamire) chose to set his hoop dreams and family legacy aside, to spread his message of love and unity through the power of words and music.\\r\\nMadgesdiq's music is Hip Hop at its core infused with a hybrid of Reggae,Funk, Soul, Rock and More!!! The vibe is melodic, head knocking and up beat. The sound is original, current, classic, and futuristic.  The lyrics are poetically braggadocious, honest, intimately explicit and full of life and it's experiences, and paint pictures easy enough for the listener to not only relate to but vividly see. His flow is naturally and athletically smooth, laid back with  a touch of edginess and awareness that reflect his Northwest upbringing and universal sensibility.\\r\\nOn a mission to not only entertain, but inspire and increase the awareness of the listener, this child of the golden era of hip-hop and faithful follower of Rastafari, delivers words and prophetic messages that carry the weight of the masters who have come before him. His instructions penetrate the ears, hearts, minds and souls of all those within reach of his call.\\r\\nWhen Madgesdiq steps onstage, you\u2019re not just witnessing an M.C. whose positive energy ministers the universal message of self\u2010acceptance and meaningful living, you are also encountering an infectious spirit who is ready to take the world by storm in the name of love and divine purpose.\\r\\nSince his debut release The Rebirth, Madgesdiq has continued to evolve as an artist. Each of his albums, which include the self-titled Madgesdiq, I Wanna Be Free, and Rastamerica (hislatest and most personal album to date), illustrate the portrait of a man who continues to bring rhyme to his inspiration and inspiration to his rhyme, while at the same time carving his own niche, delivering simple, honest and moving stories that live within and throughout what he fittingly terms \u201cEvolution Music, music that causes one to grow.\u201d\\r\\nPreviously known more for his feathery jump shot than his poetic flows or head of locks, this charismatic figure who once played along side Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo Mourning at Georgetown University, starred at the University of Oregon, and played professionally in places such as Brazil and Portugal, has since crossed over (no pun intended) and now finds himself in a different arena sharing the stage and/or collaborating with such Hip Hop and Reggae living legends as KRS-ONE, Chuck D and Steel Pulse, saxophone extraordinaire and Grammy Award nominee Mike Phillips, K\u2019naan and the modern day prophetic sounds of Midnite.  He has also appeared on \u201cLyric Cafe\u201d, which aired on BET J and was chosen to be the opening speaker for the National Poetry for Therapy Convention held in Portland Oregon in 2008.\\r\\nUsing the stage as his court, the 6\u20193\u201d Oregon native attacks the microphone with the same assertiveness, versatility, intelligence and instinct that he would use if he were breaking down a would be defender who attempted to stop him from scoring. His flow is naturally smooth, his body language athletically fluid, his energy infectious and his message simple but profound: \u201cBe Free, Do You and Love Life\u201d.\\r\\nNot limiting himself to just music, Madgesdiq has also written and self-published two books of poetry; Steppin\u2019 Out originally released in 2006 and Let Go published in 2012.  These two collections of poem and prose, which chronicle his journey towards freedom and truth, not only serve as a catharsis for the author, but as a source of inspiration for others as well. His willingness to openly discuss his pain, his fears, his faith, his observations, his aspirations truly resonate with the recipient, enlivening the spirit to the point that one feels compelled to take a deeper look inside themselves and a closer look at the world in which we live. \\r\\nWhen it comes to truth that shines an undeniable light through eloquent lyricism and ordered steps, you need not look any further than Madgesdiq. In him, you find an engaging personality destined to touch the lives of many, all while staying true to who he is and doing what he loves, inspiring others to do the same.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-og.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/16/55-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/43378026&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\\\"><\\/iframe>\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"https://soundcloud.com/madgesdiq\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.madgesdiq.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/madgesdiqmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1252137,\"name\":\"DJ Klavical\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://secretsociety.ticketfly.com/event/1356415?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
