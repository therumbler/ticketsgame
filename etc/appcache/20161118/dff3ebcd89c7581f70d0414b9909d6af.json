And at this point in the Atlanta rapper\u2019s career, few would disagree with this assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Rittz began his ascension by touring with rising star, Yelawolf. Wolf then sang the rapper\u2019s praises to Tech N9ne. Tech, never one to let a good opportunity pass him by, quickly signed Rittz to his Strange Music label. Two successful releases, The Life And Times Of Jonny Valiant and Next to Nothing, followed \u2013as did a show-stopping appearance on the 2013 BET Awards Cypher. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince his last album\u2019s release, Rittz continued to prove his mettle on the road. He toured again with Yela, as well as Kxng Crooked (formerly Crooked I), and headlined shows all over the country. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe ups and downs of life on tour are a big theme on Top Of The Line. While raising hell for months at a time was fun (as documented on the rousing \u201cAll Night\u201d), it wasn\u2019t without consequences. The powerful song \u201cJust Say No\u201d chronicles how the tour with Yelawolf went wrong. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI came back home from the Slumerican Made tour with a knee injury from partying and overdoing it,\u201d Rittz admits. \u201cIt\u2019s so embarrassing. I had to goto the hospital in North Carolina. I had to really be like, \u2018You need to slow down and start respecting what you do a little bit more.\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201dThat slowing down came with a five-month break from touring, during which Rittz composed the bulk of Top Of The Line.He had a very specific musical vision in mind, which was brought to life primarily by Strange Music in-house producer Seven. The initial inspiration came from a very unlikely source.\\r\\n\\r\\n \u201cThere\u2019s this composer, Lalo Schifrin,\u201d Rittz reveals. \u201cHe did the music for Bruce Lee\u2019sEnter the Dragon, and a lot of classic 70s movies. His music had that old kind of funky vibe to it, but it was dark at the same time. I wanted the Enter the Dragonsoundtrack over down South drumbeats, with West Coast basslines. I told Seven, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019 He started making beats that were exactly what I wanted, to a T. He really nailed it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201dIn addition to Seven, Top Of The Linefeatures music from Grammy-nominated Best \\r\\nKept Secret, Heartbeatz, Kato, Wonder and longtime collaborator Matic Lee. On the lyrical side, Rittz\u2019 patented razor sharp double-time flows are joined by contributions from Strange Music compatriots Tech N9ne and Krizz Kaliko on \u201cThe Formula,\u201d Southern rap pioneers Devin the Dude and MJG on \u201cPropane,\u201d Atlanta pioneer Cheeto Gambine (the inventor of the \u201cNorthside\u201d sign you can see Rittz throwing up in almost every picture) on \u201cDiamonds And Gold,\u201d and, on the standout track \u201cInside Of The Groove,\u201d Bay Area legend E-40 and singer Mike Posner. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chemistry with me and Mike Posner,\u201d Rittz explains. \u201cWe just sound good together. That song was one of the first beats that I got, and it had the feel of the title Top of the Line. It\u2019s smooth, it\u2019s laid-back, it\u2019s classy, it\u2019s got a grown up sound to it. When I got that, that put me in the mood for what this album should be. It should be more smooth and a little bit more fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201dTrue to his word, Rittz keeps Top Of The Linemore hopeful and upbeat than his previous work, whichfrequently focused on his personal struggles as he attempted to make it to the top of the rap game. Now that his place is secured, he can bring newfound positivity to his fans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m known for having some depressing songs and talking to the people about struggling and life kicking their ass,\u201d he admits. \u201cI still do that on this album, but even when I do, there\u2019s some kind of positive twist of hope at the end. I\u2019m not in as bad of a space as I was, so I wanted to celebrate that and be grateful for where I\u2019mat, and have that reflect in the music as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201dThat celebration comes through on \u201cKISA\u201d (short for \u201cknight in shining armor\u201d), a \u201ccouples\u2019 anthem\u201d dedicated to Rittz\u2019 now-fianc\u00e9e, a woman who has been by his side both in life and in many of his songs. It also shines on another single, the boastful \u201cGhost Story.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201c\u2018Ghost Story\u2019 is a hard song showcasing rap skills,\u201d Rittz says. \u201cYou keep hearing people saying they want to hear bars and metaphors. I can do that. I can do it all. I just feel like I\u2019ve risen above the competition. I don\u2019t even see them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201dRittz proves this over and over again on Top Of The Line. Whether it\u2019s on the dramatic title track, the rolling and smooth \u201cBack To Yesterday,\u201d or the party-starting \u201cPull Up,\u201d the album showcases an artist at the top of his craft, and finally in a better place after the struggles he documented in such vivid detail in his earlier songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album also continues the trend of Rittz making songs with his idols. Last album, it was fast-rapping pioneer, Twista. This time, Memphis\u2019 MJG and Houston\u2019s Devin the Dude show up on the single \u201cPropane.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cMJG, to me, is responsible for the way so many Southern artists have rapped for the last twenty years,\u201d says Rittz. \u201cDevin the Dude is one of my favorite rap artistsof all time, period. I used to ride around and study his syllables. The average ear might not pick up on Devin\u2019s clever word play at first, but the way he raps has always had a huge influence on me as an artist. To be on a song with these guys is like being in the ring with Hulk Hogan. I never would have thought it would happen in a million years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201dTop Of The Line shows a Rittz who deserves that kind of honor \u2013an unparalleled rhymer who has reached a place where he can finally revel in having reached theupper echelon of the rap game. \u201cThis is the top of the line,\u201d he explains. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThis is the top tier of this type of music. And that\u2019s what I aim for every time I make a song.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":959,\"height\":959},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-og.jpg\",\"width\":959,\"height\":959},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/62/01-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"GS2NmwtzKS4\",\"title\":\"Rittz - The Formula (Feat.

One of Funk Volume's premiere acts, Jarren admits, \\\"I love the music I do now. I do it in the safe-mode.\\\" That's rather shocking for an artist whose last album, Freebasing With Kevin Bacon lived up to its name, at least in attitude and style, evident on single \\\"Skitzo.\\\" He continues, \\\"I want to take it a lil' further. I just haven't had the balls to go all the way there yet, 'cause I presently want to keep a foot in the mainstream too.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, courage is not something Benton's music or live show is lacking. Studied in the anything-goes showmanship of Prince, Marilyn Manson and Method Man, Jarren shares, \\\"The essence of giving of a good show is not givin' a fuck,\\\" he says, while pointing to stage-diving, beer-chugging and more depending on the night's particular vibe. This type of authenticity, balanced with intricate, golden ear-informed lyricism has attracted attention from Erick Sermon (EPMD, Redman) to No I.D. (Common, Kanye West) in courting Jarren to potential major label deals. However for the father and family provider, only indie juggernaut Funk Volume really voiced his biggest concerns. \\\"All I was asking for was progress. I just wanted to know that what I was doing was the right move \u2013 especially chasing a dream with a family.\\\" Funk Volume offered what Def Jam and the others weren't \u2013 and in recent years, Jarren has been able to support his family and his dreams simultaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to Funk Volume, which Jarren refers to as \\\"family,\\\" the rapper maintains strong ties in the Atlanta community, such as Rittz, Playboy Tre, Spitzwell and his SMKA affiliates. \\\"It's the best of both worlds,\\\" says Jarren, of playing a significant role in a respected collective of talent, as well as being an artist in one of the most powerful new labels in Hip Hop. \\\"We all still came from that era about lyricism, even if you were making Southern music.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter two successful digital releases and a video fast-approaching one million YouTube plays, Jarren is hard at work on what will inevitably be his biggest album to date. Following the star-filled supporting cast of Freebasing With Kevin Bacon and Huffin' Glue With Hasselhoff, the comedic emcee promises to break from the series with a purpose in mind. \\\"This one has a different vibe. It's a lot more personal stuff so people can learn who Jarren is,\\\" he says, also suggesting more refined production that translates more to his ambitions of being a household name. In the same vein, that courage Jarren felt was missing is brewing on his upcoming work. The vet points to \\\"Heart Attack\\\" and \\\"Smells Like Murder\\\" with R.A. The Rugged Man as some of the most conceptual, dazzling work he's recorded to date.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"From my ranges of influence, I think a lot fans appreciate my personalities, but they don't really get into the music\u2026 yet,\\\" admits Benton of his available catalog. The stakes are high and the time is right for the man who has pursued a dream for a decade. \\\"I love this. I'm not driven by money, but I'm conscious of making music that can be universally appreciated.\\\" It is coming to life for an artist closely connected with the tenants of Hip Hop: style, skill and absolutely not givin' a fuck.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":637,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":452},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":301},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-og.jpg\",\"width\":637,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":151},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":754},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":637,\"height\":960},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/93/98/85-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"fZz4B0aDKlc\",\"title\":\"Jarren Benton - Silence (Official Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZz4B0aDKlc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"f4hbJ5zh-SQ\",\"title\":\"Jarren Benton - \\\"Skitzo\\\" [Official Video]\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f4hbJ5zh-SQ\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"RpR7HqmfAKM\",\"title\":\"Jarren Benton - \\\"Anarchy\\\" Official Music Video ft.

Lately though, a formally clad, masked rap duo by the name of Whyte Noyze has been popping up just about everywhere. And they're not just showing up \u2014 they've managed to join forces with some of DFW's biggest creative heavy-hitters for their projects. So, just who are these guys? And what's up with those masks? \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Whyte Noyze guys put it, both members grew up in very stereotypical, suburban households; Multi/ID in Carrollton and Melvin Gulley in Euless. Their parents weren't very accepting of their love for hip-hop. Multi/ID reminisces about his love for Cypress Hill's Black Sunday \u2014 and also its tragic end in his childhood home. \u201cI had very evangelical parents \u2014 they found that album and broke it,\u201d he says. Adds Gulley, \u201cI think the album I got caught with was N.W.A. You know, growing up in a white household, they loved that.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the pushback they received from their parents wasn't enough to deter them from following their creative dreams. Multi/ID's brother had a studio set up in their parents' garage when they were kids, which allowed the now-anonymous artist to hone his skills. As for Gulley, he remembers a time before song recognition apps and entire websites dedicated to song lyrics, which forced him to put more effort into learning about his favorite music genre.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved hip-hop.
