Others chronicle their times. It\u2019s a rare artist who can do both, telling their own story through songs that also encapsulate the essence of people and places who have helped define their era overall. Woody Guthrie comes to mind, and so does Bob Dylan. Bruce Springsteen certainly as well. Yet few others, for whatever genius they may possess, can relate their own history to the history experienced by those who find that common bond, be it in a coming of age, living through the same realities or sharing similar experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nEllis Paul is one of those gifted singer/songwriters.Though some may refer to him as a folksinger, he is more, for lack of a better word, a singular storyteller, a musician whose words reach out from inside and yet also express the feelings, thoughts and sensibilities that most people can relate to in one way or another, regardless of age or upbringing. The exhilaration of the open road. A \u200bcelebration of heroes.\u200b \u200bThe hope for redemption. Descriptions of those things that are both near and dear. The sharing of love..., intimate, passionate and enduring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the scenarios that emerge from Ellis Paul\u2019s new album, Chasing Beauty, a set of songs which detail, in typical Paul fashion, stories of people and places that reflect larger truths about us all. \u201cKick Out the Lights (Johnny Cash)\u201d pays tribute to that fearless American icon name-checked in its title. \u201cPlastic Soldier\u201d offers homage to a wounded soldier returning from Afghanistan. A real-life barnstorming pilot takes the spotlight in \u201cJimmie Angel\u2019s Flying Circus,\u201d while iconic Boston blue collar musician Dennis Brennan takes the focus in \u201cWaiting on a Break.\u201d Even the Empire State Building and the Boston Red Sox get their due, via \u201cEmpire State\u201d and \u201cUK Girl (Boston Calling),\u201d respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reality, these stories are a continuation of tales Paul has told for more than a quarter century, over the expanse of nineteen albums, numerous critical kudos (15 Boston Music Awards alone), inclusion in several movie soundtracks, and stages he\u2019s headlined both near and far. \u201cI\u2019ve got a car with over 4\u200b75\u200b,000 miles on it, and it's my third road vehicle,\u200b\u201d Paul declares. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing 200 shows a year for over twenty years. There isn\u2019t a town in the country where I won\u2019t find a friend. I\u2019m a nomad. And I\u2019m gonna write and play until I\u2019m gone.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt he will. Still, it\u2019s somewhat ironic that Paul gravitated towards this bigger world of intent and expression given that the place Paul considers his hometown these days isn\u2019t New York or Nashville, or Boston or Austin or \u200bCharlottesville, VA. where he lives, but rather Presque Isle, Maine, a tiny enclave surrounded by three rivers. Not surprisingly, the name translates to \u201calmost an island.\u201d Presque Isle shares a vanishing tradition with many small towns these days, where family farms are giving way to industrializ\u200bation\u200b \u200band giant corporations, and earning a livelihood from the land is no longer the simple option it once was. Nevertheless, it\u2019s still a haven for traditional values and for people as real and authentic as the soil they once tilled. If there\u2019s one grace left to cling to, it\u2019s the grace of nature\u2019s beauty, sealed off by the surrounding mountains and fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise, his geographical origins also couldn\u2019t have been further from the world at large. He was born in the dead of winter in the small town of Fort Kent, Maine, a place nestled right up next to the Canadian border. He came from humble origins, a family of potato farmers who could count among their forebears a veteran of the battle of Gettysburg, whose heroism on that field of honor earned him the 140 acres of Maine farmland that his descendants would continue to sow. It was the place that taught Paul the meaning of hard work and self-reliance, and the values that accompany as much drive and determination any individual could muster.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a boy, Paul found his escape in athletics, working out as a runner and testing his mettle in the open spaces near his home. He became a star competitor, and enjoyed the advantage of traveling throughout the nation after being given opportunities to compete. Along the way, he saw more of the country than most people do in a lifetime. \u201cI was lucky to be able to travel for competitions all over the U.S. and to see places I once could only dream of,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles, the endless plains of Texas, the Kansas prairie, the Rocky Mountain in Wyoming. Every trip was funded by a hat the town passed around on my behalf, and it never came back empty.\u201d When Paul finished second in a nationwide track competition, he was met at the airport by the high school marching band and a fire engine with spinning lights that drove him in triumph through town. In an expression of hometown pride, the mayor handed him the key to the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u200bNo one ever told Paul he had to follow in his family\u2019s tradition. He was a dreamer after all, and he had seen enough of America to know there was more out there than his little town could ever offer. Consequently, his ambitions were never destined to stay bottled up for long. He would write, paint, play trumpet and sing in the school choir. \u201cI never had anyone tell me I had to be a farmer,\u201d Paul insists. \u201cI had plenty of people telling me how my hard work and talent \u200bc\u200bould take me places\u200b. T\u200bhat\u2019s enough to get you dreaming, And enough to make you believe those dreams are within reach.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, Paul found those dreams were within his reach, at least in terms of his imagination. However\u200b their pursuit would take him far from home. His first destination was Boston College, courtesy of a \u200b\u200btrack\u200b scholarship. Yet as Paul describes it, his athletic endeavors, combined with his academic responsibilities, served to rob him of his creativity. It was only after he suffered a knee injury which forced him to take a year off that he rebounded with a new form of expression, made possible when his girlfriend\u2019s sister gave him a secondhand guitar. \u201cA mysterious, lustful partnership with the instrument followed,\u201d Paul concedes. \u201cIt became a marriage, a friendship, a lifelong bond that only comes when you find that one thing that becomes an extension of yourself. I played for hours, choosing to write \u200bmy own original \u200b\u200bsongs and sing instead of studying, socializing or exploring what the Boston streets could offer after hours.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter graduation, Paul did find time to explore those paths, while taking opportunities to indulge his creative ambitions. Working as a teacher and social worker with inner city children by day and pursuing the possibilities offered by Boston\u2019s fertile music scene at night, he gained prominence in local coffeehouses and open mic nights. It was the same circuit that opened the door for other like-minded artists of the day, and in turn, gave Paul exposure to such creative contemporaries as Shawn Colvin, Dar Williams, Patty Larkin, John Gorka, Catie Curtis, and Bill Morrissey. It also helped him win a Boston Underground Songwriting competition and placement on a Windham Hill Records singer/songwriter compilation, bringing him his first hint of national exposure at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major tipping point in his career came with the opportunity to open for Bill Morrissey, one of New England\u2019s most prominent folk artists. Paul would repeatedly ask Morrissey about his own influences and seek his advice on who he ought to listen to. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s a very smart thing to do,\u201d Morrissey muses. \u201cIt helped set him apart. A lot of young singers I meet are not curious about what went on before; they just say, \u2018I want to sing another song about my life.\u2019 Paul has a sense of roots, of connectedness to the whole history of folk music; he sees the thread that runs through all the generations of this music.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was mutual admiration that caused Paul to ask Morrissey to produce his first full album, 1993\u2018s Say \u200bSomething. It was released on Black Wolf Records, the label he founded with \u200bRalph\u200b Jaccodine, the man who would become his manager. \u201c\u200bRalph was fulfilling a dream to get into the music business,\u201d Paul recalls. \u201cStarting with a folk singer isn\u2019t a rocket\u200b launch, but we got off the ground. We started a label and began a lifelong\u200b, DIY\u200b \u200bpartnership and have been\u200b \u200bin the trenches\u200b for over 20 years.\u200b\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul also became infatuated with the music of Woody Guthrie, drawn to Woody\u2019s social consciousness and the humanitarian streak that ran through his work. He even had a tattoo of Guthrie imprinted on his right shoulder, referring to it as \u201ca badge of who he \u200bwas.\u201d His commitment to Guthrie\u2019s legacy eventually led to his inclusion in a ten day celebration of Woody\u2019s work held at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 1996, an event that included such notables as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, the Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco and which was presided over by Guthrie\u2019s daughter Nora. Later, when Guthrie\u2019s hometown of Okemah, Oklahoma hosted the first Woody Guthrie Folk Festival in July, 1998, Paul was tapped as one of the headliners. He has since made this an annual part of his touring schedule,\u200b garnering the honor of being named an honorary citizen of Okemah in the process. The connection with Guthrie continued into the new millennium when Nora Guthrie invited him to put music to a set of her father\u2019s lyrics. He later participated in the \u201cRibbon of Highway\u201d tour, a communal salute featuring such luminaries as Arlo Guthrie, Marty Stuart, Ramblin\u2019 Jack Ellott, Nanci Griffith, Guy Clark and Janis Ian, among others. \u200b\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\u2019s likely no greater evidence of how Guthrie\u2019s insights and humanity have rubbed off on Paul than in this particularly telling tribute from Nora Guthrie. \\\"A singer songwriter is only as good as the times he reflects,\u201dshe said in praising Paul. \u201cIn times like these, when so many nuts are running the show, it's comforting to know that Ellis Paul is actually holding our sanity on his own stage! Wise, tender, brilliant and biting, Ellis is one of our best human compasses, marking in melodies and poems where we've been and where we might go if we so choose to. Personally Ellis, I'm goin' where you're goin'!\u200b\\\"\u200b\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere Paul is \u201cgoin\u2019\u201d is to practically every place a microphone beckons and a crowd of the folk faithful awaits. He\u2019s become a staple at the Newport Folk Festival, \u200bplayed Carnegie hall, and venues from Alaska to Miami, Paris and London. In addition to his 19 albums released on the Rounder and Black Wolf record labels, his music has appeared on dozens of distinguished compilations. A \u200bFilm/\u200bDVD entitled \u200b3000 Miles\u200b\u200b -- part concert film, part documentary, part instructional video -- provides a further prospective on both the man and his music. He\u2019s also released a pair of children\u2019s albums, earning him honors from the Parent\u2019s Choice Foundation \u200bfor both.\u200b \u200bH\u200bis latest, \u200b\\\"\u200bThe Hero In You\u200b\\\" has been turned into a\u200b picture book, detailing the lives of great American heroes\u200b.\u200b Ellis' literate, evocative and insightful writings are further showcased in a book of poetry and short stories entitled \u201cNotes from the Road,\u200b\\\" already in it's third pressing. \u200b\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s no wonder then that recently Paul received \u200ba \u200bprestigious\u200b honor: an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of Maine, which also asked him to \u200bwrite the school's \u200ba\u200blma \u200bmater a\u200bs well as \u200bdeliver its commencement address in May 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappily, his music has been shared with a wider audience as well, through commercials, documentaries, TV shows and in the soundtracks of several blockbuster films, among them three by the Farrelly Brothers -- \u201cHall Pass\u201d (starring Owen Wilson and Alyssa Milano), \u201cMe, Myself, & Irene\u201d (starring Jim Carrey) and \u201cShallow Hal\u201d (starring Jack Black and Gwyneth Paltrow). Peter Farrelly summed up the sentiments of all those who have come to know and appreciate Paul\u2019s music by referring to him as \u201ca national treasure.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNot surprisingly, Paul\u2019s consistently been heralded by others as well. \u200bO\u200bne writer noted \u201cthat it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music -- storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent would, out music doesn\u2019t have to reflect our culture.\\\" \u200bAnother reviewer was even more pointed. \u201cEllis Paul is one of the best singer/songwriters of his generation,\u201d she commented. \u201cAnd for many of us he is the face of contemporary folk music. Few are as smart, as literate, as poetic as Paul. I cannot think of another artist on the acoustic music scene is better loved by fans, or more respected by his contemporaries.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, he is all that, and in a very real sense, even more. He\u2019s an observer, a philosopher, and an astute storyteller who shares with his listeners the life lessons he\u2019s learned, and in turn, life lessons they ought to heed as well. By affirming and defining who he is, Ellis Paul affirms and uncovers the essence of us all.\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Lee Zimmerman (writer/reviewer for American Songwriter, No Depression, New Times, Country Standard Time, Blurt, Relix, and M Music and Musicians\u200b)\u200b\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":600},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-og.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":600},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":600},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/57/28/49-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://ellispaul.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"https://myspace.com/ellispaul\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/ellispaulmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ellispaulsongs\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ellispaulsongs\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1099013?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
