She has come to the edge of the rushing river of confusion and experienced a God who made a way where there seemed to be no way. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it is from that place\u2014of finding God in the dark and unexpected\u2014that Holcomb wrote and recorded Red Sea Road (Full Heart Music), set to release Jan 27th, 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI think my first record was probably more help my unbelief,\u201d says Holcomb. \u201cBut I think this one would be more I\u2019m surprised and delighted to say that God is faithful\u2026I know that\u2019s true more than I did a year or two ago.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLoss, disappointment, and fear of the unknown have marked Holcomb\u2019s journey of grappling with and believing in God\u2019s faithfulness. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a year in general of just aching with the people that we love and walking through a lot of brokenness,\u201d says Holcomb. \u201cA lot of life lived and lost.\u201d But the suffering has created a collection of songs rich in lyrics, powerful in melody, and equal parts honest and hopeful. \\r\\n\\r\\nHolcomb says, \u201cThis record feels more declarative because I have just needed to sing the truth into the dark.\u201d It sounds more declarative too. From triumphant anthems to contemplative, piano-driven melodies to upbeat and catchy ones, each song on Red Sea Road is connected by a common thread of bold and much-needed truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Holcomb began writing for the album\u2014before she knew it would be an album\u2014she thought, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is for anybody else, but I need to sing these songs. I need to sing these for my own soul.\u201d It\u2019s what David did in the Psalms, she says. \u201cHe bosses his soul around in song.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote this idea into the chorus of the title song on the album, \u201cRed Sea Road\u201d: We will sing to our souls / We won\u2019t bury our hope / Where He leads us to go there\u2019s a red sea road / When we can\u2019t see the way, He will part the waves / And we\u2019ll never walk alone down a red sea road.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wrote \u201cRed Sea Road\u201d for several close friends who suffered tragic losses in their families, yet clung to hope in Christ in the midst of it. As she worked on the song with longtime co-writers Christa Wells and Nicole Witt, Wells recalled something author Ann Voskamp had written on her blog: \u201c\u2026we believe that an unseen Hope makes a Red Sea Road where there seems to be no way.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nHolcomb says that phrase captured the essence of what she was trying to say through this song. During trying times, just like the Israelites experienced with the Red Sea in front of them and the Egyptians behind them, our temptation is to throw our hands up in despair. \u201cWhat I was seeing in all of this,\u201d she explains, \u201cis that He was drawing near and making a way for us to carry on when we felt like we couldn\u2019t carry on any longer.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe saw this steadfastness and hope in her friend\u2019s families, and she saw it in another family: her own. \\r\\n\\r\\nRight before they began recording Red Sea Road, Holcomb\u2019s dad, and producer on the album, Brown Bannister, went to the doctor for a regular appointment. That routine check-up turned into an unexpected cancer diagnosis. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe were about to start recording and this blow happens to our family,\u201d recalls Holcomb. But her parents\u2019 response to the diagnosis surprised and encouraged her: \u201cIt was so strange because I remember my mom and dad had a lot of peace. They were like, \u2018We\u2019re going to choose to praise God, and at the end of the day, no matter what happens, healing is ahead. Whether it\u2019s this side of glory or the next, we have hope. We have hope because of Jesus.\u2019\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWatching their peace and trust in God allowed her to feel peace too, she says. The circumstances were not good, and yet, we sensed God\u2019s nearness and felt peace when it made no sense to feel that way. It was a powerful season that marked my heart forever. The whole experience brought new meaning and depth to the instruction found in Philippians 4:4-5: \u201cRejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your graciousness be known to everyone. The Lord is near.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDrawing from this truth, she wrote the words to the album\u2019s first single, \u201cFind You Here,\u201d a soft yet powerful song that talks about the surprising places we find God: Here in the middle of the lonely night / Here in the middle of the losing fight / You\u2019re here in the middle of the deep regret / Here when the healing hasn\u2019t happened yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day Bannister went in for surgery, Holcomb was recording \u201cFind You Here\u201d in the studio with Ben Shive, co-producer on the album. She brought a copy of the scratch vocal to the hospital, and she and her mom and dad listened to it together that night. \\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Bannister is cancer free. \u201cI know that\u2019s not the end of every cancer story,\u201d says Holcomb. \u201cBut it was a really sweet gift to our family to get to listen to that song as we were walking through that scary & unknown season together. It was such a reminder for us that Jesus draws near to the brokenhearted. My prayer is that \u2018Find You Here\u2019 would help bring peace to anyone walking through a season that is overwhelming or heartbreaking.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with Jesus drawing near, Holcomb says another theme on this album is the promise that He will. He\u2019ll bind up the brokenhearted / He\u2019ll set captives free from darkness / He\u2019ll breath hope into the hopeless\u2026so ring the lyrics on the aptly titled \u201cHe Will.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nHolcomb began writing \u201cHe Will\u201d when she got sick in the middle of a radio tour. She had been meditating on Isaiah 61\u2014\u201cHe has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and freedom to the prisoners\u2026to comfort all who mourn\u2026to give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes\u201d\u2014so instead of focusing on how bad she felt while on the road, she says she focused on God\u2019s promises. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt was such a beautiful trip. I felt so bad but ended up just seeing God carry and support me so much\u2026This whole record has been God reminding me that He\u2019s faithful even when you\u2019re sick. Even when things don\u2019t turn out like you thought they would, He will bring healing and hope. He will be who He says He is.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough music is a natural outpouring for Holcomb, and she has the accolades to back up her talent\u2014As Sure As the Son landed her a Dove Award for New Artist of the Year and a nomination for Best Pop/Contemporary Album\u2014this growing artist calls herself  \u201ca very reluctant musician.\u201d Having had two kids since starting her last album, she knows the pull of creating and touring while also being a mom and a wife. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI know this job often takes you away from home,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though I love this, I feel called to this, and I feel alive when I\u2019m doing it, it\u2019s still hard to leave my kids. At the end of the day, though, I just want to be faithful to the work God has called me into, whether that\u2019s being a mom, writing a song, or traveling to perform.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Red Sea Road, Holcomb learned that she can write music anywhere, anytime, even with two small children at her feet. She wrote during nap times and at night, but if inspiration struck during waking hours for her kids, she would simply pull out her phone and start recording. Sometimes it was while cooking dinner, sometimes it was when she was pushing Emmylou, her daughter, on the swing. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of, \u2018Hey, here\u2019s life. I\u2019m going to write this song and you\u2019re going to be crawling around at my feet and dancing as I\u2019m writing it.\u2019\u201d Maybe the writing process wasn\u2019t perfect, she says, but \u201cit was beautiful.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen it comes to her music career, Holcomb has never held on too tightly: \u201cI want to say yes if He\u2019s calling me to this. And I want to say yes if He\u2019s calling me away from this. So I just hold this thing with really open hands. Right after I released my first record, people were already asking, \u2018When\u2019s your next record?\u2019\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer response? \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s next, but it\u2019s more Jesus and it\u2019s more of God\u2019s Word and more of me asking Him to help me believe that His promises are true on the days that I struggle to believe.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Red Sea Road turned out to be. Only, it\u2019s not just an album helping Ellie Holcomb to believe. It\u2019s an album that will sing light into the dark of anyone\u2019s life who is listening. It will remind us all that Jesus is near and no matter what path feels impossible right now, He will make a way where there seems to be no way. Because unseen hope makes a red sea road.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1440},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-og.jpg\",\"width\":1365,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":975},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/55/28-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.ellieholcomb.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/ellieholcombmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ellieholcomb\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ellieholcomb\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://cgwaco.ticketfly.com/event/1378006?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
