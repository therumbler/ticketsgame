urge to begin a new project, for CRX\u2019s Nick Valensi, came from a primal place: He just wanted to play. \u201cI was at a place where I got really hungry to perform in front of audiences, and do things a little more simply,\u201d Valensi says. \u201cThe Strokes don't play that often anymore, and when we do it's awesome, but it got to the point where I needed to balance that out with a project I could take on tour whenever I wanted to. And the idea of playing clubs again was really exciting to me.\u201d But Valensi couldn\u2019t start playing until he\u2019d written some songs, and he realized he\u2019d have to finally embrace an aspect of performing he\u2019d resisted up until that point -- singing. Last summer, he just dug in, grabbing whatever spare time he had to record demos on his laptop at home. \u201cIt was a learning process,\u201d says Valensi. \u201cIt took me some time to figure out how my voice sounds most natural, and to think about what I wanted to say.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nIn his earliest writing sessions, Valensi gravitated toward more aggressive, riff-driven songs like the menacing \u201cUnnatural,\u201d whose breakneck tempo approaches speed metal velocity. The heavy, hazy \u201cBroken Bones\u201d -- inspired by a motorcycle accident that left the guitarist hospitalized for two weeks -- counterbalances its massively sludgy bottom end with Valensi\u2019s surprisingly effortless falsetto. But as he continued demoing songs, Valensi found himself exploring other sonic territories, indulging his long held love of 70s power-pop and 80s new wave on tracks like the bright, catchy \u201cWays To Fake It\u201d and the dub-tinged \u201cOne Track Mind.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the songs progressed, Valensi invited a few trusted musician friends to join the nascent project, and to contribute as songwriters. In addition to Valensi on guitar and vocals, CRX includes bassist Jon Safley, keyboardist/vocalist Richie Follin, drummer Ralph Alexander, and guitarist Darian Zahedi. \u201cOnce we were all in a room together, it got collaborative pretty quickly,\u201d Valensi says, noting that about half of New Skin\u2019s ten tracks are cowrites with the band. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter demoing several songs, Valensi reached out to Queens of the Stone-Age\u2019s Josh Homme, for feedback on the tracks and advice regarding producers who might be right for the band. It quickly became apparent that there was no better person for the job than Homme himself. \u201cHe was really enthusiastic about the demos,\u201d says Valensi. \u201cThere were even specific things he loved from the demos so much that we ended up including them on the album, which was very much a Josh decision.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nNew Skin, CRX\u2019s debut album, was recorded at Homme\u2019s Pink Duck Studios in Burbank, with work wrapping up in early 2016. And even as this year marks the fifteenth anniversary of The Strokes first LP, it represents the beginning of a promising new chapter for Valensi. \u201cOne of the coolest things for me is that I began making this record as a vehicle to get onstage,\u201d he says, \u201cbut along the way, it started to feel like we were working on something more special than that. I\u2019m excited to be singing and having a lot of fun with it, and I\u2019m really enjoying the feeling of having to work hard to win people over. It\u2019s like being a kid again -- like everything is new and kind of scary but irresistibly fun, too.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":614},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":192},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":192},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":128},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":128},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-og.png\",\"width\":1622,\"height\":1038},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":64},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":64},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":320},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atxl1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":320},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atxxl.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":416},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/27/91-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":416}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.crxmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/CRXmusic/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/crxmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"crxmusic\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1739273,\"name\":\"Dead Heavens\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/56/47-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.deadheavens.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/deadheavens\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/deadheavens\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"deadheavens\"},{\"id\":920351,\"name\":\"Streets of Laredo\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Streets of Laredo is a sing-a-long collision of jangling harmonies, stomping percussion, horns, guitars, and more crazy instruments than you can shake a sampler at. \\r\\n\\r\\nFounded by close-knit family members Daniel, Dave and Sarahjane Gibson and inspired by the fervour and madness of the 70's folk-rock circuit, the band was born out of trying to escape the mundane everyday working life. Older brother Dave tells the story, \\\"Both Dan and I had done the hard yards in bands in New Zealand but we were worn out and a little lost by it all. And broke. I was running this t-shirt company and Dan walks in one day to tell me that he's finished with music and he's gonna go get a real job. All of a sudden my 'big brother' instinct kicks in and rather than see this young songwriter throw it all away, I gave him a job doing t-shirt orders, and we started working on demos and writing songs together, pretty much day and night from then on in.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRefining their sound and songs one holiday weekend at a beach house on the New Zealand coast, the Gibsons started to fashion a sound that was equal parts folk storytelling and psychedelic madness. \\\"Sonically we wanted to stay true to our long list of influences, but we wanted to screw it up as well \u2013 kinda twisty, like Paul Simon on bad acid.\\\" With just one home-town show under their belt, a handful of demos and a whole lot of hope, they took the plunge and decided to move halfway around the world. Fast forward to the summer of 2012 and Streets of Laredo in a rehearsal space in Brooklyn NY with a guitar, a drum-machine and no money, trying to figure out what comes next. And what came next was songs, lots of 'em.\\r\\n\\r\\nSarahjane describes the feeling, \\\"I'd never lived overseas before, let alone in a city like New York, so the sense of isolation and homesickness \u2013 coupled with excitement and the unknown \u2013 was hugely overwhelming. But pretty soon all of these emotions were turning into lyrics and songs that were really about being a brand new immigrant in America. I mean, the only thing we really knew was that we'd finally made it to New York, we were making music, and we sure as hell weren't about to leave.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nQuickly adding fellow countryman Thom Darlow and local Brooklynites Sean McMahon and Andrew McGovern to the mix, this now rambling, multi-instrumental, seven-piece started to craft a dance-inducing mix of  vocal hooks, beats and wild sounds that saw the New York music scene embrace them as their own \u2013 building a firm reputation in the music halls of Brooklyn and the Lower East Side for playing danceable, crazy songs that kept fans coming back for more \u2013 not to mention seeing the band feted as a must-see act at both CMJ and SXSW. Dan sums it up nicely, \\\"It all started with the song Girlfriend. We'd started writing that song before we left New Zealand so it had idealistic hints of what we thought this place would be like \u2013 but after living in Brooklyn for a while it took on a whole other layer, kinda like a mistress that can be unfaithful and hard to deal with but also a lot of fun \u2013 and that kind of informed the writing of what would become our debut record.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA quick trip back to New Zealand saw the band record the bones of 'Volume I & II' \u2013 ten songs inspired by their old life in NZ and their new life in NYC \u2013 in an old converted Auckland theatre where, courtesy of friendships and favours, they locked down that distinctive Streets of Laredo sound. \\\"An influential blog called Girlfriend a 'twisty psychedelic take on the old folk narrative', which seemed fairly appropriate for our sonic tastes and style, and the rest was history.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nLike Bob Dylan running late to a Ramones concert or Paul Simon getting blind drunk with Grizzly Bear, however you describe them the resulting songs and sound have had an instant effect on fans and critics alike. Streets of Laredo are proud to announce the much-anticipated release of Volume I & II, out October 7 on Dine Alone Records.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":674},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":211},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":140},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-og.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":899},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":70},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":351},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":457},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/15/07-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"<iframe style=\\\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\\\" src=\\\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2751965773/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3616472412/transparent=true/\\\" seamless><a href=\\\"http://streetsoflaredo.bandcamp.com/album/demos\\\">Demo&#39;s by Streets of Laredo<\\/a><\\/iframe>\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"//www.youtube.com/embed/OEwjxMbPnNs?rel=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.streets-of-laredo.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/streetsoflaredo\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/streetslaredo\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"streetslaredo\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.dougfirlounge.com/event/1340823?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
