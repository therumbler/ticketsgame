With conscious, thought-provoking lyrics, infectious reggae-laden grooves and high-energy, impressive live performances, Sol Seed creates an unforgettable live-music experience for people of all ages to enjoy. Since transplanting to Eugene from Southern Oregon three years ago, Sol Seed has swiftly gained powerful momentum in the NorthWest music scene, creating a diverse and loyal fan base all over Oregon, Hawaii, Washington, Montana and California. They have been awarded Eugene WOW Hall Awards \\\"Best New Act\\\" 2011 and \\\"Favorite Local Band\\\" 2012 and 2013, in addition to \\\"Eugene's Best Band\\\" two years running by Eugene Weekly readers, and recently won the prestigious title \\\"Next Big Thing\\\", another Eugene Weekly award. Dominating the NW summer festival circuit including Oregon Country Fair, North West World Reggae Festival, Kaleidoscope, Jefferson State Hemp Expo and more, Sol Seed has also shared the stage with national acts such as Ziggy Marley, Slightly Stoopid, The Green, Karl Denson, Pepper, The Expendables, Pacific Dub, Nappy Roots, Heavyweight Dub Champion and many more. After a number of small EP releases, the group released their first full-length album \\\"Grown Deep\\\" in September 2012, which immediately gained air-time on a number of radio stations all over the West Coast as well as the Hawaiian islands. After a very successful 2013 Kickstarter campaign to fund their next album release, \\\"Family Tree\\\", Sol Seed is in the studio with the full-lungth studio album slated for a Spring of 2014 release.\\r\\nThis Oregon based band got their start in early 2010 when songwriters Michael Lennon and Michael Sorensen joined hands with fellow friend and musician Benny Pezzano through a Southern Oregon open mic. An undeniable synergy was all but tangible as their creative forces coalesced, and they immediately began to grow a diverse collection of original music. They soon joined with Native American Award winning guitarist, Kenny Sequoia Lewis, and in October 2010, transplanted to Eugene to pursue life and music, where soon after they linked up with MC, Didgeridoo player and percussionist Sky Guasco. With 5 members, each member boasting very different influences and skill sets, Sol Seeds depth and volume of sound increased exponentially. With day-jobs being an ancient memory, the close-knit members of Sol Seed have fully embraced the band that has created much more- A movement, a lifestyle. With an infectious enthusiasm for life and an unequivocal knack to communicate its beauty, the group shares their message of perspectivism and unconditional love through uplifting music rooted in the soul.
