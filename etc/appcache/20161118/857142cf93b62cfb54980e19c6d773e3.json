The now 27-year-old\u2019s claim to fame came early on in his teens when he, alongside his brother, appeared on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d as Nuttin\u2019 but Stringz. Two urban kids from Jamaica, Queens, playing a blend of hip hop and classical melodies with a violin was somewhat surprising to viewers, and unique to say the very least; and the duo quickly shot to stardom\u2013 appearing in commercials and movies, touring, and even adding a platinum selling album to their accolades. But growing creative differences eventually became too much for the pair to bear, and the success of Nuttin\u2019 but Stringz came to an end\u2013 shattering the name and reputation Damien worked hard to establish, and forcing him to rebuild from rock bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the fall, Damien is reveling in the climb. Since re-launching his career, Escobar boasts of 200K downloads from his first R&B mixtape, \u201cSensual Melodies\u201d; and has more than a few notable solo headliner performances under his belt including: CBS Upfront Presentation, Food & Wine Magazine\u2019s Best New Chef Awards, Indy Car Championship Awards, Major League Baseball Annual Golf Fundraiser Event, Angela Simmons \u201cElectric Daze\u201d Fashion Show, Russell Simmons\u2019 Hip Hop Inaugural Ball, and corporate concerts for FRIDAYS, Walmart, Target, and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nEscobar, once a self-proclaimed retired violinist, is now on everyone\u2019s radar; and has even obtained online success with viral videos picked up by media giants such as WorldStarHipHop.com, Huffington post, and Allhiphop.com. A recent feature in PEOPLE Magazine elevated Escobar to new heights in his solo career; highlighting his movement of giving back to others by doing random acts of kindness.The star even found his way back on national television, accepting an invitation to appear as a performer in WEtv\u2019s \u201cDavid Tutera\u2019s: Unveiled\u201d. And since then invitations to appear on television haven\u2019t ceased; landing Escobar in the interviewee chair at FoxNews and NBC, with other appearances lined up for the remainder of 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a veteran, knowing the ups and downs of the industry, Escobar has committed to centering his career around the loyal fans he refers to as \u201cgood people,\u201d who constantly remind him of why he got back into music. His appreciation for the support system he feels sustains him, spawned his Pop-Up Performance campaign. Armed with a giant speaker, a mic, and his violin, Escobar set out to surprise unsuspecting New Yorkers with a pop-up concert experience. The response to his documented journey was overwhelmingly positive, and resulted in Damien announcing a five city pop-up performance tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, Escobar is appreciating his journey as a fresh new artist, with the release of his high-energy, inspirational single \u201cFreedom\u201d which debuted on CNN.com. He is scheduled to go on tour in Mid-May, and can be seen on \u201cThe Katie Couric Show\u201d on May 28th. The artist has also tapped into the book industry, penning his first children\u2019s book entitled \u201cThe Sound of Strings.\u201d He will begin his book tour at the start of the new school year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010 Nuttin\u2019 But Stringz disbanded and Damien Escobar emerged as a solo artist out to make a name for himself. Humble in his dealings but confident in his craft, Damien makes it no secret that he\u2019s determined to gain recognition for being the \u201cdopest\u201d violinist to crossover into mainstream music. In an industry not overpopulated by instrumentalist, the urban-rock violinist is looking to change the game. He\u2019s a pioneer with a plan, and the future of music rest in his hands.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.damesco.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/dameesco\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Dameesco\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Dameesco\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1305359?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
