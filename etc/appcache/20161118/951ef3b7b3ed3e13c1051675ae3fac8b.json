Bands as diverse as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Rank and File, Lords of\\r\\nthe New Church, The Residents and a week-long stint by Iggy Pop graced the hallowed walls of that\\r\\nnow-defunct nightclub. If you drive down Spring Street today, there's just a doc-in-a-box where the\\r\\npunk rock used to be.\\r\\nI met Tim Nielsen just after I moved to Atlanta from Milwaukee. One night I was playing in a pickup\\r\\nband with Die Kreuzen, my good friends from back home. (Check out their Touch and Go records\\r\\nproduced by Butch Vig.) They were staying on my floor, just passing through on tour. We played a lot\\r\\nof shows together a couple of years back when I was in a punk band called The Prosecutors, so we\\r\\nfigured what the fuck? Let's see what happens.\\r\\nTim was there that night. He played in the big 688 band The Nightporters and was a rock star in\\r\\nAtlanta. He pulled me aside after the show and asked me if I lived down here. I told him that I had just\\r\\nmoved to town and was working at the sewage plant, retired from the music world for good at age 24.\\r\\nTim stopped by my apartment one afternoon a couple of weeks later and TOLD me he was gonna find\\r\\nme a band to be in. My music was on the folk side of Dylan at the time but I decided I was up to\\r\\nplaying just for the fun of it. He got me practicing with a few guys but it wasn't really happening, so\\r\\neventually he decided we'd just start our own damn band.\\r\\nTim quit The Nightporters and stole their drummer and we played our first drivin' n' cryin' show at\\r\\n688 in October 1985. A little over a year later, I'm sitting in my living room with an album, a real,\\r\\nfreakin' 12-inch vinyl LP record called Scarred But Smarter.\\r\\nI wanted to be in a band that would be unafraid of changing genres, mostly because I'm easily\\r\\ndistracted and change subjects mid-sentence. \\\"Needs help with self control,\\\" read every report card\\r\\nafter fifth grade\u2026.smartass\u2026underground comic-readin' journalistic wannabe\u2026too lazy to write a\\r\\ncomplete story\u2026.I settled on the song format\u2026it's perfect\u2026a short poem\u2026with its own soundtrack.At 24, I wrote:\\r\\nNobody said it would be fair\\r\\nThey warned you before you went out there\\r\\nThere's always a chance to get restarted\\r\\nTo a new world, new life\\r\\nScarred but smarter\\r\\nAt that time, I had restarted myself. I come from an industrial land of things that used to be:\\r\\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, class of 79\u2026a town, back then, that encouraged you to leave high school, get a\\r\\njob in a factory, get injured and then get workers compensation while picking up a side job at a liquor\\r\\nstore or record shop where you got paid under the table.\\r\\nThe band released its first album for Island, Whisper Tames The Lion, produced by Anton Fier, in\\r\\nearly 1988. The album peaked at No. 130 on the Billboard 200. College radio success (and some\\r\\ncommercial) accumulated with airplay of the songs \\\"Can't Promise You The World\\\" (for which the\\r\\nband filmed its first video) and \\\"Powerhouse\\\".\\r\\n1989 marked the release of some of the band's most memorable songs on the Mystery Road album,\\r\\nsuch as \\\"Honeysuckle Blue\\\" and \\\"Straight To Hell.\\\"\\r\\nTHE '90s\\r\\nIn 1991 the more hard-rocking Fly Me Courageous ended up being the band's most commercially\\r\\nsuccessful album, with the album being certified gold. The next few years the band toured with artists\\r\\nsuch as Neil Young and Soul Asylum. In 1993, DNC released another album produced by Geoff\\r\\nWorkman, entitled Smoke, which peaked at No. 95 on the Billboard's Top 200 album chart. This\\r\\nalbum was another all-out rocker, marked with guitar assaults, but it failed to catch on with the\\r\\npublic as had its predecessor.\\r\\nLotsa touring, lotsa recording, lotsa people, lotsa stress, lotsa change, lotsa lotsa.\\r\\nIn 1994, the band decided to move away from the heavy guitar sounds of the previous two records\\r\\nand brought in keyboardist Joey Huffman to replace Buren Fowler. That same year the band left\\r\\nIsland Records and found a new home at Geffen Records. The band's first and only Geffen album,\\r\\n1995's Wrapped In Sky, featured newly added keyboard sounds and a return to the band's original\\r\\nsound. 1997 brought along a self-titled album, followed two years later by a live album, The Essential\\r\\nLive Drivin' 'N' Cryin'.THE '00s\\r\\n2009's (Whatever Happened To The) Great American Bubble Factory (the first recording of new\\r\\nmaterial in 12 years!) was the perfect crescendo to a long twenty-plus year career of drivin' n' cryin'.\\r\\nI think we found the true essence of what we started to build back in 1985. It's the truth as we see it\\r\\nset to a soundtrack fueled by music we love, everyone from The Ramones, The Clash, The Seeds,\\r\\nIggy, Dylan, Patti Smith Group, R.E.M., Thin Lizzy, The Rolling Stones. You get the point.\\r\\nThe song title for (Whatever Happened to the) Great American Bubble Factory hit me one afternoon\\r\\nwhen I was at the dollar store getting some bubbles for the neighborhood kids. As I was standing in\\r\\nline, I looked down at the \\\"made in\\\" label and noticed that those bubbles were made in\\r\\nChina\u2026..China!! That's a long way for a bottle of freakin' soap to travel. Come on, maybe we can't\\r\\nmake TVs or refrigerators or cars here anymore, but bubbles?\\r\\nIn my world, the first step to a renewed America and our deliverance from an unspeakable disrespect\\r\\nof the American workforce would be the opening of THE GREAT AMERICAN BUBBLE FACTORY. They\\r\\nwould come from miles around to see the Willie Wonka of the New Deal\u2026.There's hope again!!! If you\\r\\ncan make it here, why don't you make it here\u2026\\r\\nWe started demos for this record back in 2001 on September 10th. The next day the world was\\r\\nupside down and traitors were everywhere, underneath every coffee cup. Joe McCarthy was back\\r\\nand I just didn't feel like I was ready to tell the story of the blue-collared optimist\u2026\\r\\nShe said, 'Son, you're dreamin'\\r\\nWell, ma, if I'm dreamin'\\r\\nJust don't you wake me\\r\\nThat record weaves in and out of the \\\"Midwestern Blues\\\" to the Flannery O'Connor South of \\\"This\\r\\nTown\\\" to the industrial grind of \\\"Detroit City\\\" to the optimistic anthem (and Dictators cover!!) \\\"I\\r\\nStand Tall\\\" to the genuine pining for home in \\\"I See Georgia.\\\"\\r\\nI wanted you settled in, riled up, loaded for bear and somewhere out there on the road in search of\\r\\nthe great American dream\u2026The '10s\\r\\nCut to 2011/12: the Georgia General Assembly commended Drivin' N' Cryin' in a house resolution for\\r\\nthe band's achievements.\\r\\nSadler Vaden joins the band (replacing Mac Carter on lead guitar), we cut a deal with Redeye\\r\\nDistributors to keep our records out there in the public eye, we sign on with the William Morris\\r\\nEndeavor to book our shows, and a new record release concept comes to mind\u2026!\\r\\nA couple months ago I was writing in the morning and my wife was listening to a record. She said I\\r\\nshould record that song and I said 'well, I did.' It was the last song on the last record ! It dawned on\\r\\nme then that most people that listen to records don't usually listen past five or six songs, so I'm going\\r\\nto make a record with only five or six songs on it. In fact, I'm going to do four\u2026 Or five\u2026 Or maybe\\r\\nthe rest of them this way!!!! This solves a lot of problems for drivin n cryin. I love the fact that we\\r\\nhave never shied away from the fact we are influenced by so many different sounds. But sometimes\\r\\ncombining them on one record can be somewhat disconcerting to a particular group of fans. I love\\r\\nthat. I love the psychedelic element of challenging the listener. I mean it's all based on a library of\\r\\nmusic from our past\u2026 THE KINKS and THE WHO meet the RAMONES and THE COUNT FIVE at a little\\r\\nbar owned by BOB DYLAN and JOHNNY CASH\u2026 But the opportunity to focus on a specific genre or\\r\\nsubject is exciting to me\u2026. Also an opportunity to record with all the people we have been looking\\r\\nforward to working with is almost limitless\u2026 We would love to work all over the country with our\\r\\nfriends and the five song format means we only need a few days of their time\u2026 I think people will be\\r\\nexcited when they own a few and can contrast the different sounds and producers\u2026 We released\\r\\nnumber one, Songs From The Laundromat, on June 12, 2012. Paul Ebersold produced number two:\\r\\nSongs About Cars, Space And The Ramones (released Oct 1, 2012) - a tip of the hat to The Ramones,\\r\\nStooges, MC5. So we toured all over for those 2 EPs and then headed in the studio again to work on\\r\\nnumber 3\u2026 Songs From The Psychedelic Time Clock.\\r\\nNow jump to 2013: Songs From The Psychedelic Time Clock is released April 16, 2013. The band hits\\r\\nthe road (again!) in support of all 3 EP releases, starting the tour in Atlanta with 2 sold-out nights at\\r\\nthe legendary Star Community Bar (2 NIGHTS! NO HITS!) and capping it with a very cool show at\\r\\nAtlanta's Music Midtown Festival, sharing the stage with Journey and Phoenix. Work begins on a\\r\\nsuper secret TV project for Fox's FX Network to air January - April 2014. (more on this at a later\\r\\ndate!) On days off between tour dates, the band convenes in Nashville TN and Memphis TN with\\r\\nproducer Paul Ebersold to work on EP4 Songs For The Turntable.2014 ushers in great new things including new lead guitarist Aaron Lee Tasjan. Tasjan was honored\\r\\nby ASCAP at the Kennedy Center in 2013 as one of America's great songwriters of the next\\r\\ngeneration. A much sought after guitarist, he has played lead guitar with The NY Dolls, Alberta Cross,\\r\\nEverest, Todd Snider, collaborated with Sean Lennon in the band Operation Juliet and had his songs\\r\\nrecorded by Jack White and Pat Green.\\r\\nSeason 5 of F/X Network's hit TV show 'Archer' features 12 songs produced by Kevn Kinney (8 of\\r\\nwhich are Kinney-penned songs, including a complete re-working of DNC hit 'Straight To Hell').\\r\\n'Songs For The Turntable' is released on Blank Records to great reviews and acclaim. Once again\\r\\nuber-producer Paul Ebersold assumed the helm, working with the band both in Nashville and\\r\\nMemphis, TN. Work begins on compiling the tracks and bonus material for a vinyl box set release.\\r\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\\"I don't have the patience anymore for a two year recording project, a big build up as if you're JD\\r\\nSALINGER, a tour and then reality again\u2026 I don't like hype\u2026 I just want to offer up my art for the fans\\r\\nor soon-to-be-fans.
