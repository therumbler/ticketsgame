outfit from Brooklyn, NY, whose modern take on the classic funk sound has established them as leaders in the funk revolution that\u2019s currently taking place in the genre. Blending elements of Pop, R&B, and Soul with their distinct aggressive funk core, Turkuaz sounds like the musical love child of Sly & the Family Stone and Talking Heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the release of their new album Digitonium, Turkuaz\u2019s sound is more accessible than ever and poised to break out to a more mainstream audience. With a playful feel that evokes the best of 80s dance music, Turkuaz\u2019s tightly arranged songs are built on thick grooves, driven by powerhouse rhythm and horn sections, as well as four distinct vocalists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group\u2019s constant coast-to-coast touring since 2012 has earned them a passionate and dedicated national fan base that\u2019s consistently growing. A dance band at their roots, Turkuaz\u2019s live shows are high-energy, floor-shaking, visually appealing events filled with colorful clothing and choreographed dance moves that always leave attendees wanting more.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkuaz\u2019s crossover appeal has never been more evident\u2014from a recent video performance going viral and receiving over 2 million Facebook views, to their music providing the soundtrack to New York Knicks games at Madison Square Garden, to constant rotation on Sirius XM Radio, Turkuaz is, as Relix Magazine says, \u201con the verge.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/85-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://turkuazband.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/turkuaznation\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Turkuaz\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Turkuaz\"},{\"id\":1664939,\"name\":\"The New Mastersounds\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"<iframe width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wn86zVDp6A\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nFor their landmark tenth studio album, The New Mastersounds trace the New Orleans side of their funky family tree back to their roots. Made for Pleasure, due out October 2, 2015 from revered independent label, Royal Potato Family, was recorded at The Living Room, a converted wood-frame church directly across the Mississippi River from downtown New Orleans. The British foursome\u2019s latest collection of infectious grooves is steeped in those storied waters and the rich musical history they\u2019ve carried.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the occasion, The New Mastersounds \u2013 guitarist Eddie Roberts, drummer Simon Allen, bassist Pete Shand, and keyboardist Joe Tatton \u2013 invited several guests to join them in the studio. Longtime compatriot Mike Dillon recorded with the band for the first time, while former American Idol semi-finalist and Native American activist Charly Lowry leant her powerfully soulful vocals to three tracks. Tenor saxophonist Joe Cohen and trumpeter Mike Olmos, both members of Roberts\u2019 Stateside band, the West Coast Sounds, also joined the sessions. A late addition was Denver-based reggae singer Spellbinder, who added his distinctive vocals to an unexpected cover of Iggy Azalea\u2019s hit \u201cFancy.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title Made for Pleasure \u2013 which is taken from the organ-driven, Meters-influenced opening track \u2013 captures both the band\u2019s guiding mantra and the raucously seedy underbelly of the Big Easy. \u201cThat\u2019s very much the ethos of the band,\u201d Roberts explains. \u201cWe make music for our own pleasure and for other people\u2019s pleasure. It\u2019s about sharing energy with an audience, whether it be live or listening at home.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat energy was in flux when the band reunited in the studio for a week last January. Roberts, usually the Mastersounds\u2019 chief songwriter and musical director, found himself suffering an unusual bout of writer\u2019s block. Far from resulting in a less-inspired album, however, the affliction led to the rest of the band contributing ideas and developing them live in the studio, leading to their most collaborative effort to date.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt was a very interesting and exciting week,\u201d recalls Allen. \u201cAs it unfolded we wrote and developed a whole load of new things, some of them going in directions that we\u2019ve not gone in before. It was scary initially, then exciting, and then very satisfying at the end when we realized we had a really great record.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat collaborative spirit extended to the recording itself; The Living Room\u2019s 3,500 square-foot space allowed all of the musicians, including the horn players, to record live together in the same space. That was especially unusual in the case of the horns, which have traditionally been overdubbed on New Mastersounds albums. \u201cIn the past the guest horns haven\u2019t really influenced the writing process of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Allen says. \u201cBut on this record they were with us while we were jamming in the studio, so grooves and tunes that might not have gone anywhere suddenly came to life because they were coming up with top-line melodies to make sense of our grooves.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOne such tune is \u201cHigh & Wide,\u201d a brisk, up-tempo tune that evokes the punchy, buoyant horn- driven funk of classic American R&B. The horns are also a key element on \u201cLet\u2019s Do Another,\u201d a cinematic tune reminiscent of both Headhunters-style funk-jazz and vintage action films \u2013 an impending gunfight or car chase looms heavily over the track.\\r\\n\\r\\nMike Dillon also contributes vibraphone and tabla to the latter tune, one of three appearances he makes on the album. While he\u2019s performed live with The New Mastersounds frequently over the years as their paths have crossed on the festival circuit, this is the first time their chemistry has been captured in the studio. The versatile percussionist, a member of Critters Buggin, Les Claypool\u2019s Fancy Band and Garage A Trois, also contributes congas to the classic soul-jazz sound of \u201cCigar Time\u201d (penned by Roberts during a single cigar break) and percussion to the relentlessly anthemic \u201cEnough is Enough,\u201d featuring Lowry\u2019s impassioned vocals.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoberts initially encountered Lowry during a gig with Everyone Orchestra in the vicinity of her North Carolina home. The guitarist was immediately blown away by her knockout voice and her dedication to the Native American cause. \u201cShe\u2019s so natural and she\u2019s got things to say,\u201d Roberts enthuses. \u201cShe\u2019s an amazing being and I was excited to work with her.\u201d She also sings on \u201cJust Gotta Run\u201d and the upbeat, gospel-inflected \u201cJoy.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSpellbinder came into the picture after the recording session was completed, when Roberts happened upon him \u201ctoasting\u201d \u2013 the reggae equivalent of hip-hop freestyling \u2013 in a Denver bar. \u201cI loved his voice and they were very conscious lyrics,\u201d Roberts recalls. \u201cSo I went up to him after he\u2019d finished and asked him what he was doing on Sunday. I was going in to mix the album that weekend, so I asked him to lay some lyrics down. I hadn\u2019t told the rest of the band, so when I finished the mixing I told them I had a surprise for them.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise was an urgent vocal performance over the top of the band\u2019s first recorded excursion into reggae, a bold cover of \u201cFancy\u201d by unlikely Australian rap sensation Iggy Azalea that had been suggested by Roberts\u2019 18-year-old daughter. The song follows a similar dip into pop hits on the Mastersounds\u2019 previous album, Therapy, a cover of Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cTreasure.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album\u2019s other cover stems from closer to home: \u201cSitting On My Knees\u201d is a dose of classic British mod psychedelia by the Dave Pike Set, which becomes a showcase for Roberts\u2019 ferocious guitar playing. Also inspired by the homeland if \u201cJust Gotta Run,\u201d a nod toward the Northern Soul scene of the \u201870s and \u201880s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Mastersounds themselves have become as widespread as their influences since their founding nearly twenty years ago. Only Allen remains in their native city of Leeds; the band now has members living in such far-flung locales as Denver, Colorado and the Balearic Islands off the coast of Barcelona. They\u2019ve also become collaborators with many of those influences, working with such idols and peers as Lou Donaldson, Corinne Bailey Rae, Grace Potter, Karl Denson, Melvin Sparks, Fred Wesley, Pee Wee Ellis, Maceo Parker, Zigaboo Modeliste, Art Neville and Ernest Ranglin.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/00/79-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.newmastersounds.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/newmastersounds\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/NewMastersounds\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"NewMastersounds\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1279859?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
