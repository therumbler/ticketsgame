In just a few short years, the group\u2014Wilbur, fellow horn player Wenzl McGowen, and drummer James Muschler\u2014has gone from playing on New York City subway platforms to touring with the likes of Beats Antique, They Might Be Giants, and Lotus, as well as selling out their own headline shows in major venues around the country. On \u2018Red Sky,\u2019 their third and most adventurous album to date, the band uses everything they\u2019ve learned from their whirlwind journey to push their sound to new heights, bringing together the raw, transcendent energy of their live performances and the sleek sophistication of their studio work into a singular, intoxicating brew that blends elements of virtuosic jazz, groovy funk, and pulse-pounding electronic dance music.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI think \u2018Red Sky\u2019 is more focused than any of our past albums,\u201d reflects McGowen. \u201cWe practice meditation and yoga, and I think that we\u2019re more evolved as people than we\u2019ve ever been right now. That evolution expresses itself as focus, and through focus comes our energy.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was two years ago that the band released \u2018This Is Cave Music,\u2019 an exhilarating thrill ride that earned rave reviews from critics and fans alike. NPR hailed it as \u201cunhinged\u201d and \u201cirresistible,\u201d praising each musician\u2019s \u201cremarkable abilities\u201d and naming their Tiny Desk Concert one of the best in the prestigious series\u2019 history. The album followed their 2013 debut, which had Relix swooning for their \u201cdeep bass lines, catchy melodies and pounding rhythms,\u201d while the Wall Street Journal celebrated their \u201celectronic house music mixed with brawny saxophone riffs.\u201d Though the band\u2014whose members initially met as students at the New School\u2014turned heads in the music industry as relative unknowns with a charismatic, unconventional sound (they play with unique tonguing techniques and utilize found objects like traffic cones attached to the bells of their horns to manipulate tone, for instance), they were already a familiar and beloved sight to straphangers in New York, who would react with such joy and fervor to their impromptu subway platform sets that the NYPD had to ban them from locations that couldn\u2019t handle the crowds. NY Mag once referred to their sound as \u201cJay Gatsby on ecstasy,\u201d while the NY Post fell for their \u201ccatchy melodic hooks and funky rhythms,\u201d saying they had \u201cthe power to make you secretly wish that the short [subway] wait becomes an indefinite delay.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the band\u2019s busking days are behind them now, the lessons they learned from all those platform parties helped guide their approach to recording \u2018Red Sky.\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhat we discovered playing in the subway,\u201d McGowen explains, \u201cis that the more focus and the more energy you put into the music, and the more you listen to everything around you and integrate everything around you into your expression, the more the music becomes this captivating force for people.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nRecorded at The Bunker studio in Brooklyn, \u2018Red Sky\u2019 is nothing if not captivating. The album opens with the tribal urgency of the title track and proceeds, over the next 45 minutes, to utterly demolish any and every possible barrier that could stand between your ass and the dance floor. On \u2018Shot,\u2019 Wilbur sings a stream of consciousness vocal line over an airtight groove, while \u201cPsychotubes\u201d channels the apocalyptic fire and brimstone of death metal, and the staccato intro of \u201cThat\u2019s What They Say\u201d gives way to a gritty, late-night come-on of a saxophone line that\u2019s far more suggestive than any whispered words ever could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the band is heavily inspired by electronic music, they made a conscious effort to use as little in the way of \u201cstudio tricks\u201d as possible on \u2018Red Sky,\u2019 aiming instead to capture the sound of their live show, which has evolved significantly from their days underground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhen we were playing in the subways, we were playing entirely acoustic,\u201d explains Wilbur. \u201cIt was just two saxes and a drum set. Then Wenzl acquired a baritone sax and we all started getting into music production and incorporating electronic music into our live shows.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt their performances, the band now plays through what they call a Reverse DJ setup, in which the live sound from their horns runs through Ableton software on their laptops to process recorded effects onto the output. In addition, to flesh out their sound on the road, the band began utilizing Moog synthesizers, an EWI (an electronic wind instrument that responds to breath in addition to touch), and other more traditional instruments like clarinets. Wilbur added vocals to his repertoire on some tracks (something the subway never allowed him to do), and Muschler, meanwhile, traveled halfway around the world to expand his percussion skills.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI went to India, and the first morning I woke up, it was like 5am, and I followed this music along the banks of the Ganges,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI eventually ended up finding this amazing tabla player, and after his performance, I asked him for lessons. He agreed, and I went for daily lessons with him and another guy for the next two weeks. After that, I took a train to Calcutta, where I met with the guru that I\u2019d studied with in New York, and I did morning lessons with him and practiced throughout the day. It was an incredible musical immersion experience.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band members all speak reverently of meditation and consciousness and the role it plays in their music (McGowen believes his introduction to it, spurred on in part by Wilbur and Muschler, saved his life), but equally close to their hearts are the environmental causes they champion. Moon Hooch tries to live up to their green ideals while traveling as much as possible, playing benefit shows, supporting local farmers and co-ops, participating in river cleanups, filming informative videos for their fans, and more. The band even runs a food blog, Cooking In The Cave, in which they highlight the healthy, sustainable, organic recipes they utilize with their mobile kitchen setup on tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the members of Moon Hooch, commitments to consciousness and environmentalism and veganism and philosophy and peace aren\u2019t separate from their commitment to music, but actually integral parts of it. It\u2019s all tied into that same core approach that led to their discovery on the subway platform: try, even if it\u2019s just a little bit every day, even if it\u2019s just with the power of your mind, to make the world less like it is and more like you wish it could be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019d say all of our songs express the essence of that kind of energy,\u201d concludes McGowen, \u201cbecause before you can even think any thoughts, there exists the energy that drives those thoughts, and that energy is intention. I feel like we\u2019re putting the intention of positive change constantly into our music. While we\u2019re playing, I often see the future emerging: skyscrapers getting covered in plants, frowns turning into smiles, fistfights into hugs. I can see the energy of love and collaboration and trust replace the energy of fear, hatred and violence.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s an ambitious vision, to be sure, but considering the band\u2019s track record at turning their thoughts and dreams into action and reality, perhaps it\u2019s only a matter of time.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":641},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1367},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/81/57-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.moonhooch.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://facebook.com/moonhoochmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/moonhooch\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"moonhooch\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1679113,\"name\":\"Honeycomb\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Currently based out of Massachusetts, the vocal cord conductor known as Honeycomb has quickly risen to the top of the food chain of northeast beatboxers, placing 13th in the 2015 American Beatbox Championships.

The three have been writing songs and performing since they can remember. As children, the siblings were all soloist in the Metropolitan Opera's children's chorus, singing along side the likes of Pavarotti, Rene Fleming and Placido Domingo. And before that, they were performing and touring with their parents, both professional NYC freelance musicians.
