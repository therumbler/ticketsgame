STREET FRIEDMAN\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Recently relocated from Brooklyn to the North Shore of Long Island, it is no surprise that Roger Street Friedman developed a great passion and love for music. His father was an artist, his mother was a writer, and his two older brothers talented guitar players. He left home at 18 to join a rock band in NYC and pursued a career in music until his mid 20's when he left the music world to pursue other interests. After nearly three decades of being virtually out of the music business he was struck by a creative revelation. \\n\\nEight years ago he and his wife found out that she was pregnant with their first child.  This unexpected joy, along with the pain of losing his parents, provided Roger with a renewed sense of artistry and led to the realization that music is what he should be pursuing full time. He started writing and performing around Brooklyn and in January of 2014 released his acclaimed debut \\\"The Waiting Sky\\\". \\n\\nHis songs have been widely played on Americana and Roots Radio stations throughout the country and he's been featured on USA Today, CMT, American Songwriter and Relix Online\u2026 to name just a few.  Last month Roger and his band were featured on John Platt's \\\"The Sunday Breakfast\\\" on WFUV in New York. The album is currently in the Top 20 on The Roots Music Report. \\n\\nHe and his band have opened for the legendary Los Lobos and The Blind Boys of Alabama and recently performed a coveted Quad Showcase at the annual Northeast Regional Folk Alliance gathering in upstate New York. He also did a live performance and was interviewed by Jimmy Buff on WDST. \\n\\nOf \\\"The Waiting Sky\\\" John Apice from No Depression writes: \\\"Roger has a voice you can listen to all the way through \u2013 track to track\u2026Its songs are sympathetic, arouse feelings, and they are above all sophisticated \u2013 not complicated \u2013 just possessed of life lessons, sparks of reminiscence. They all possess a good example of what great music is supposed to be. It's not an opera, it's not even a soap opera. These songs are more like buttons on a shirt that hold it closed against the wind, holding all the memories in your chest, in your heart.\\\"\\nRyan Smith of \\\"The Direct Buzz\\\" says; \\\"True artistic beauty can't be forced or fabricated. It requires authentic inspiration and dedication from an artist to see his or her vision come into fruition. Roger Street Friedman's debut solo album \\\"The Waiting Sky\\\" exemplifies this.\\\"\\n\\nFriedman's aesthetic is a diverse blend of folk, blues, R&B, rock n' roll, and country. He's been compared to Jackson Browne, Peter Gabriel, The Dead, Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, and Joan Armatrading. His songwriting is concise and powerfully introspective. Backed by a phenomenal band, his live shows are intimate, and filled with warmth.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":388,\"height\":260},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":388,\"height\":260},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":201},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-og.jpg\",\"width\":388,\"height\":260},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":388,\"height\":260},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":388,\"height\":260},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":388,\"height\":260},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/36-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":388,\"height\":260}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.ei-pr.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/rogerstreetfriedman\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/rsfmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"rsfmusic\"},{\"id\":1774875,\"name\":\"Derek Smith\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"From the tangled web of Chicago open mics and showcases to middle-of-the country comedy clubs and dive bars emerges Derek Smith.\\n\\nDerek Smith was a different kind of little kid.

In recent years the term seems to have very different meanings depending on who you're talking to. The distance from this idealism, and the search for identity that inevitably comes with it, are some of the themes explored on Butchers Blind's new EP, entitled A Place In America. This latest release marks a significant step forward for the band \u2013 the songwriting, the performances, and the recordings have never sounded sharper and more in focus.\\nButchers Blind formed in 2009 in Bellerose, New York. Pete Mancini, Paul Cianciaruso, Brian Reilly, and Christopher Smith came together through mutual friends and a shared love of music. In 2011, they signed with Paradiddle Records, and released two critically acclaimed LP's \u2013 Play For The Films (2011), and Destination Blues (2013). The albums garnered the band glowing reviews and radio airplay around the world. Constant live shows and regional touring have cemented the band's reputation as a solid live act.\\n\\nThe songs on A Place In America expand on their established Americana roots sound and venture into new sonic territories. Whether its the layered keyboard textures on 'Dead Horses' or the rich, harmony driven sound of 'Only Love', the band is comfortably at home trying out new arrangements in the studio. 'Black and White Dreams', 'Ghosts', and 'Twisting In The Wind' are classic representations of the Butchers Blind sound \u2013 melodic, hard driving rhythms that stay with you long after you hear them. The title track, however, is the centerpiece of this release; an image-heavy lyrical narrative drives the song as the band builds to a boiling point. A simple, honest refrain cuts through the tension: \\\"I wish I had a place in America\\\".\\n\\nWe are all searching for a place, a name, or something to call our own. With this next release, Butchers Blind just might find their place in the proud tradition of American music.  \\n\\nButchers Blind are:\\nPete Mancini - Guitar/Vocals\\nPaul Anthony - Drums/Vocals\\nBrian Reilly - Bass\\nChristopher Smith - Piano\\n\\nButchers Blind has opened for Blues Traveler, Gin Blossoms, Pure Prairie League, Steve Forbert, Robbie Fulks, James Maddock, Iain Matthews, Turin Brakes, and Marah.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atjmbo.jpeg\",\"width\":340,\"height\":255},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atjmbo1.jpeg\",\"width\":340,\"height\":255},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atlg.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":225},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atlg1.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atmd.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":150},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atmd1.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-og.jpeg\",\"width\":340,\"height\":255},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atsm.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":75},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atsm1.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-sq.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-sqsm.jpeg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atxl.jpeg\",\"width\":340,\"height\":255},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":340,\"height\":255},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atxxl.jpeg\",\"width\":340,\"height\":255},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/37-atxxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":340,\"height\":255}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://butchersblind.com/home.cfm\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/butchersblindmusic\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/butchersblindmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/butchersblind\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"butchersblind\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://goldsoundsbar.ticketfly.com/event/1386267?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
