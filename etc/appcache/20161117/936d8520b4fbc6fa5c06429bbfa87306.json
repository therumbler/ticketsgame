allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\u2019t call country music newcomer Luke Combs an outlaw. The word doesn\u2019t really fit, though he does have an undeniable independent streak. And outsider doesn\u2019t really work anymore either, since he\u2019s come to Nashville and quickly won himself a record deal and quite a bit of attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutlier is the better fit for Combs. The 26-year-old has built an already enviable following and succeeding far beyond expectations. His social engagement numbers are in the hundreds of thousands and streaming spins are in the millions, is only now releasing his first single, \u201cHurricane,\u201d to Country Radio.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cStand in front of me while I\u2019m on a stage and you will be a fan,\u201d Combs said earnestly. \u201cI'll make a fan out of you. I'm going to give everything I've got on stage and play songs that I've written that are genuinely important to me.  That, I think, is what really, translates.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nCombs will soon be taking his unique sound to a wider audience, having signed with River House Artists/Columbia. The Asheville, North Carolina, native will release his debut album, This One\u2019s For You, later this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis One\u2019s For You showcases everything that\u2019s exciting about the former college rugby player and singer-songwriter \u2013 the booming voice, the ability to capture and convey a wide variety of emotions, the honesty that resonates in his songs and the ability to win over men, as well as women, in his audience - a rare quality in today\u2019s music scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombs has covered a lot of ground in the first five years of his career, building an audience in Charlotte and Boone where he majored in Criminal Justice at Appalachian State, then circling out until his fan base grew into the thousands and he moved to Nashville to pursue the next level.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough he enjoyed singing most of his life, he\u2019d never considered music anything more than a hobby. He was working at a go-cart race track the summer between his junior and senior year when his mother mentioned an interesting fact. \u201cKenny Chesney didn\u2019t learn how to play guitar until he was 21,\u201d she said. Combs was 21 and had an old guitar laying around, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, around this time, he discovered the music of fellow former Appalachian State University attendee Eric Church, whose presence could still be felt on campus as his career began to take off in distant Nashville. Combs appreciated Church\u2019s raw honesty and emotional timbre. He also liked that Church crafted his own songs, adding authenticity to his rowdy live-show persona. He dove anew into the music of Chesney and childhood favorite Tim McGraw, relearning the love for country music he had as a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next three years, he formed a band, played live every chance he got and built a multi-state following in the thousands. So like Church and all those others, he figured he\u2019d go see what Nashville had to offer. Not long after he was booked to play a club in Rome, Georgia. Out of nowhere, he drew a crowd of 400 fans who were singing along with every word. It didn\u2019t go unnoticed and that date led to a showcase in Nashville and soon thereafter, a booking agent and a manager joined Team Combs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey started him out in markets like Birmingham, Alabama, and Greenville, South Carolina. They put him on a tour of the small towns that make up the Southeastern Conference \u2013 places like Starkville, Mississippi, and Athens, Georgia. The trend was always the same with audiences doubling in size each time he came back. He was an act breaking out of towns that didn\u2019t break acts.  All of those roads have led to here, as he preps to embark on a tour in support of his debut album launch that stretches as far as the West Coast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThere's nobody that's a champion for the little guy or the underdog,\u201d Combs said. \u201cI feel like that's why when I get on stage people can relate to me. They say, \u2018Man, that could be me up there. That's just a regular guy. I can walk up to that guy and say hello to him and he's going to be nice to me. He's going to drink a beer with me.\u2019 That's who I want to be.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, a much wider array of fans will get their chance to meet Combs \u2013 the singer/songwriter will embark on an aggressive touring schedule leading up to his album launch including stops in Nashville, Ft. Worth, Seattle, Los Angeles and many, many more in between.\\r\\n\\r\\nCombs is probably best known for the single, \u201cHurricane,\u201d a song about a small town break up that has already helped him amass over 140,000 followers and climbing across social media platforms, and now 20 million streams of his music.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cPeople just love it. You can't plan that,\u201d Combs said. \u201cYou can't plan what people are going to like or what people are into. It just doesn't work. I put it out, and people loved it. I might have been even a little surprised by it myself. I do owe a lot to that song, and that's why it's important to me. It's gotten people to come to my shows. It's gotten people to hear my other songs. All my deals have come from that song.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOther standouts on the project include the catchy party singalong \\\"Beer Can\\\" and rockin\u2019 self-help mantra \\\"Don't Tempt Me With A Good Time\\\".  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the raucous blue-collar anthems ring true, Combs rounds out the album with feel good nostalgia on \u201cThat\u2019s What Memories Are Made Of\u201d and tugs the toughest of heartstrings with the clever word play in \u201cI Got A Way With You\u201d.  Combs co-wrote every track on the full-length debut.\\r\\n\\r\\nFans have quickly latched onto the album\u2019s title track, \u201cThis One\u2019s For You,\u201d a tribute to all the people who\u2019ve helped Combs make it to this pivotal point in his life and career.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have met people along the way that have both directly and indirectly influenced me musically.  Then, there\u2019s the support of my family and friends. I've gone through so many things that my parents have helped me with, my friends have helped me with\u2026I felt like I owed a lot of people a lot of things for me getting to this point. That song is my way of saying \u2018thank you\u2019.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.lukecombs.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/lukecombsmusic/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/LukeCombsMusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"LukeCombsMusic\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1383069?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
