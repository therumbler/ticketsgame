Celebrating 20 years of their self titled debut LP\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Toby Morse - vocals\\r\\nRusty Pistachio - guitar, vocals\\r\\nAdam Blake - bass\\r\\nColin McGinniss - Guitar\\r\\nTodd Friend - drums\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nH2O is a band that had beginnings like any other band. No one could have guessed that a few guys and a former roadie from New York would start a band as a one-song side project and it would turn into a world-touring powerhouse. They took humble roots and worked their way to add their chapter to the long history of New York Hardcore and they would define the term \u201cmelodic hardcore\u201d that would become so common years later. From 1996 to 2003 was unavoidable- four albums on Blackout!, Epitaph, and MCA records with over 300,000 copies sold, constant world touring with the likes of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Rancid, AFI, Pennywise, & the Used, Sick Of It All, the Misfits, 7 Seconds, and Madball, as well as runs on the Warped Tour-they established themselves as a household name and inspired countless others in their wake. In the pre-internet world of hardcore and punk, H2O was the band that blended the heavily-tattooed, unbridled rage of New York bands like the Cro-Mags and Agnostic Front, with the punk melodies of bands like the Descendents and Token Entry. It\u2019s hard to argue that bands a decade later would take the melodic hardcore groundwork laid by H2O to wider audiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's now 2008 and H20 is still here, but Nothing To Prove is not a comeback \u2013 that\u2019s way too simple. Nothing to Prove is a statement of everything the band is and a taste of what the band will be in the future - and it\u2019s nothing short of incredible. Frontman Toby Morse said it best, \u201cThis time feels urgent. I feel everything on this album has been building up over the last seven years. That\u2019s why this album is called Nothing To Prove - because it\u2019s all out on the table.\u201d This is H2O\u2019s most personal, most angry, most positive, hardest, yet catchiest album to date, and it comes into a scene not unlike the scene that H2O originally entered. Hardcore and punk as concepts have been diluted, confused and hyphenated to the point where it\u2019s a marketing term. Nothing To Prove is a ten-song breath of fresh air and honesty that is poised to revive an otherwise stagnant \u201cscene\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe re-emergence of H2O hits with the first notes of the opening track, \u201c1995.\u201d Only a few solitary chords before the crashing of a fast, raw and melodic song, complete with classic sing-alongs and a perfect breakdown. The title track is next and while it\u2019s only a minute and a half blast, \u201cNothing To Prove\u201d sums up H2O\u2019s manifesto for this release: the band is back and while their history speaks for itself, they\u2019re not resting on any laurels. Featuring Agnostic Front\u2019s Roger Miret and the one and only Danny Diablo, the band shows they haven\u2019t forgotten where they came from. As the album progresses, H2O reminds the listener that their penchant for infectious anthems and choruses has not dissipated one bit.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLyrically, we see Toby Morse as up front and honest as he\u2019s ever been. Anthems about being straight edge in his 30\u2019s (\u201cStill Here\u201d), to being a responsible adult with tattoos (\u201cHeart On My Sleeve\u201d), and the personal sacrifices and vulnerabilities we all feel (\u201cUnconditional\u201d) are all present on Nothing to Prove. With \u201cSunday,\u201d listeners get a stunning display of Morse\u2019s personal story - the passing of his father when he and his brother, H2O guitarist, Todd Morse, were young children, and the subsequent birth of his own child on the same day of the week. Toby bares it all in one of the most personal songs H20 has written. Ending with the anthem, and first single, \u201cWhat Happened?\u201d we are presented with a testament to the power of H2O. The song is an anthem about questioning the ethics and motives of bands and music in general today, but the subject is addressed in a positive way. They take an infectious anthem and up the ante with appearances by Lou Koller of Sick Of It All and Matt Skiba from Alkaline Trio both showing what they do best. It\u2019s a formidable closer and it\u2019s the last statement in an album that is the most forthright in their career thus far; their hearts are on their sleeves. Bassist Adam Blake commented, \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen Toby NEEDING to write lyrics. He just kept writing and writing and writing and it came so easy to him once he got started.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes Nothing To Prove such a monumental album is that it is a collaboration of many long-time H2O fans, only now, instead of stage-diving and singing along, they\u2019re behind the boards of the recording studio, designing the artwork and releasing the albums. Produced by longtime fan and friend of the band, Chad Gilbert (New Found Glory), a new perspective was brought in. Toby said, \u201cChad really knew how to help us take good songs and make them sound great.\u201d Gilbert stated, \u201cI am a fan of H2O and this is an album that fans of H2O want to hear. They needed to make this record and I\u2019m really proud to be a part of it.\u201d Bridge Nine Records\u2019 owner Chris Wrenn and label manager Karl Hensel both have their own histories with H2O running over a decade as well. \u201cThis entire project has been amazing,\u201d Wrenn stated. \u201cEveryone involved is passionate about the album and it\u2019s been a great experience watching this album get created start to finish and to see the band\u2019s reaction and excitement about the finished product. They\u2019ve never had this kind of control or say in every last aspect of the process. It\u2019s an honor that H2O is a part of our legacy and it\u2019s an honor that Bridge Nine is apart of H2O\u2019s legacy.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nH2O, much like you\u2019d expect, is hitting every corner of the globe spreading the word that H2O is undeniably back.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":634,\"height\":634},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-og.jpg\",\"width\":634,\"height\":634},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":634,\"height\":634},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/19/71-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1722073,\"name\":\"Wisdom In Chains\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Wisdom In Chains was started a few years back with members from America and Europe. Maarten, a guitar player from Holland in a band called Daredevil made the call to Richie and Mad Joe who where in Krutch at the time. Maarten had the idea to start an old school band, with heavy punk and OI influences. The three met while Krutch was on tour in Europe. The plans where made and Maarten came to the USA to record. The group released a self entitled CD on Gangstyle Records. Only one show was ever performed by the group due to the extreme distance between the members. Eventually Maarten who was a key writer in the band would convince Richie and Joe to find local members and keep this band going. So they recruited local guitar star and just crazy motherfucker in general Tony Meltdown. Tony was in a band called The Ninth Plague and basically shreds on the guitar. Shannon Sparky was brought in on drums, he was a logical choice. Shannon also played with Richie and Mad Joe in another band called Out To Win (aka MUSHMOUTH). The search was on for the bass player, and the only guy that could jam with these cats was Big Show Greg, a local trouble maker and drunk. The new line-up was complete and now the band is hitting the highways and playing killer street rock with heavy old school HC and OI influence. After two well received releases with this line-up Meltdown would eventually leave the band, filling his shoes is none other then Evan Feeble. Evan a long time friend and also guitar player from Feeble (Mad Joe's first band) joins the group just in time for their long awaited I Scream Records release The question on the streets is \\\"Can they top their previous efforts?\\\" the answer \\\"HELL YEA\\\" their new album \\\"Everything You Know...\\\" will be full of surprises. Lou from Sick of it All, joins them on a track, this release is so diverse and interesting some consider it the \\\"rebirth of the album\\\" time and thought where put into this release, from the
