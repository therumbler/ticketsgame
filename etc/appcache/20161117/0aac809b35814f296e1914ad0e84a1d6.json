Elena Mendoza\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"With Y LA BAMBA, Luzelena Mendoza draws from both her strict Catholic upbringing as an only daughter of a Mexican immigrant and a debilitating illness that led her to fall away from her faith, to create what LA Weekly calls \\\"Devendra Banhart-influenced art-folk with hazy femme vocals and traditional Mexican sounds.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMendoza's father immigrated to the Bay Area from the Michoacan region of Mexico after meeting her mother who had received her US citizenship as a teenager.  Her father got a job at a southern Oregon sawmill and Luzelena would spend her childhood summers on a farm in California's San Joaquin Valley among peach, almond, and fig orchards.  It was in these strong Mexican communities that she would soak up the melodies and the stories that were being told while, as she remembers it, \\\"the men with tassel hats\\\" strummed their guitars and sang their traditional folk songs in three part harmonies.  \\\"I remember singing along, mimicking my father's voice and dancing like a little wild child,\\\" she recalls.  For Mendoza, this music was the only way she could relate to her father, and was a bright spot in a rough childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, Mendoza traveled to New Zealand and India, in a quest for a deeper understanding of her spiritual growth as an active Christian, hungry for the tools to create a shift on this planet.  During her trip to India, she contracted amoebic dysentery and giardia, causing her to suffer from insomnia, lose 60 pounds and fear her loss of sanity. \\\"It shook me in ways I was not expecting, leading me to struggle with my prayer life and search for a healthy relationship with God, the universe, and with myself,\\\" says Mendoza of her condition (which was only complicated with a misdiagnosis).  \\\"I gave up on Christianity and what religion was starting to mean to me due to a natural awareness that was knocking on my door.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon her return to the US, she took in a white six-toed cat to keep her company as she fought to regain her physical, emotional and spiritual health.  She christened her new feline companion La Bamba, a name that she incorporated into a moniker for her home recordings and performances at open mic nights in her new home, Portland.  Bassist and vocalist Ben Meyercord caught some of Mendoza's open mic performances and the two quickly found a musical connection.  In a whirlwind week that she said happened magically, Mendoza recruited Mike Kitson on drums and David Kyle on guitar.  Luzelena played in an Ashland band with Kitson when she wanted a more quiet alternative to her early punk roots and Kyle was a musician she met online that shared her spiritual and eccentric philosophies.  Intuition told her that she was going to meet the final piece in her musical puzzle and, sure enough, she stumbled upon accordion player Eric Schrepel playing the squeezebox at a puppet show.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a raw songbook of home recordings under her belt and a new group of musicians to help Mendoza with her musical vision, Y LA BAMBA began to captivate audiences in Portland and tour stops around the US.  Eventually, the quintet would attract the attention of The Decemberists guitarist Chris Funk, who offered his production skills for the band's first studio recording.  Funk worked tirelessly to capture Y LA BAMBA's rustic tones, songs inspired by the traditional tunes of Mendoza's childhood, and her signature vocals that resemble the sounds spilling out of a 1930's Victrola.  Dubbing the confidently stunning body of songs Lupon (after a nickname that Mendoza's father despised), Y LA BAMBA has emerged from the studio, ready to wow listeners everywhere.  Lupon will be available during the fall of 2010 on Tender Loving Empire.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://ylabamba.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/luz.e.mendoza1\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1765200,\"name\":\"Rebecca Gates\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":962301,\"name\":\"Casey Neill\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Casey Neill's career has always walked the line between lyrical song craft and ferocious live shows. He is a songwriter and bandleader from Portland, Oregon with a sound that explores haunting melodies, high octane folk-punk, and weather beaten narrative. Neill performs solo and with his band, The Norway Rats - a murderer\u2019s row of Northwest music vets from acts such as Black Prairie, Eels, and The Minus 5. For over a decade he has toured throughout the US, Europe, and Japan. A new record titled 'All You Pretty Vandals' produced by Chris Funk of the Decemberists was released in November of 2013. It\u2019s an anthemic, junkyard rock album Neill says he\u2019s \u201cspent a decade trying to get to - both in my own writing and the sound of the band.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cBe it through raucous rockers, fragile acoustic ballads, passionate bursts of punk fury or soulful touches of Irish folk, Neill's narrative talent and concern for real people's struggles stand out. (Neill) evokes an epic feel that fits perfectly with the implicit grandiosity of this emotional material, delivered with a raspy, affectionate voice that recalls Life's Rich Pageant-era Michael Stipe. The results are so evocative, you'll be tempted to steep further in these memories, the better to share Casey Neill's particular blend of personal and historical experience.\u201d \u2014 SPLENDID \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"These are songs with stories well told. This is what it's all about\\\" \u2014 STEVE EARLE \\r\\n\\r\\nCasey is a frequent side player in power pop band The Minus Five along with Scott McCaughey and Peter Buck of R.E.M. He added vocals to tracks on \u2018Scott the Hoople in the Dungeon of Horror\u2019 - a 5 LP, 57 song collection of new Minus 5 music released this past Record Store Day. Hardcore bands, bluegrass acts, and other songwriters have performed and recorded Casey\u2019s songs - most notably Irish supergroup Solas\u2019 take on \\\"Lowground\\\" on their CD's \\\"Waiting for an Echo\\\" and \\\"Reunion\u201d. His career launched in 1997, after inking a three record deal with acoustic label Appleseed and contributing tracks to their Pete Seeger Tribute collection along with Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, and Bonnie Raitt. A compilation of his material entitled 'Memory Against Forgetting' was released by Indigo Girl Amy Ray's Daemon imprint in 2005. Following a few years treading the boards in New York City, Casey moved back to Portland and it's thriving music community.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Soul-searing songs \u201c\u2014 UTNE READER \u201cremarkably good songwriting\u201d \u2014 NO DEPRESSION\\r\\n\\r\\n In 2007, a far more electric Casey Neill record \u2019Brooklyn Bridge' was released and The Norway Rats were formed. 'Goodbye to the Rank and File' followed in 2010 and garnered rave reviews from online blogs, radio, and press. In 2011, Casey was hired by New York's Mabou Mines Theater Company to perform and compose for their new work 'Landscapes' at PS122. In the year since the release of All You Pretty Vandals, Casey and band have performed over 100 shows in 21 states including NPR\u2019s prestigious Mountain Stage Radio show. The album is a series of character sketches, and two cities dear to him, Portland and New York. There are love songs to Patti Smith (\u201cShe Came Alive\u201d) and the Lower East Side (\u201cSainted Streets\u201d), hymns to the roadless Northwest wilderness (\u201cThe Dark Divide\u201d), and \u201cMy Little Dark Rose\u201d, featuring Langhorne Slim. The song is a snapshot of Portland in the 90s, when the city was \u201ca much rougher place and the music was louder,\u201d adds Neill. \\r\\n\\r\\nMusic critic Jay Horton described it best for Portland\u2019s arts paper Willamette Week: \u201cCasey Neill has been filtering post-hardcore energies through an Americana muse for tales of wry lamentation, and the barroom mythologizing wed to painstaking craft has never sounded so perfectly realized. He brings a certain empathetic grandeur to high-minded tales of resolutely low lives with crack musicianship and casual authenticity\u201d.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atjmbo.jpeg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":599},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atjmbo1.jpeg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atlg.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atlg1.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atmd.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atmd1.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-og.jpeg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":599},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atsm.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atsm1.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-sq.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-sqsm.jpeg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atxl.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":499},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atxxl.jpeg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":599},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/78/33-atxxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.caseyneill.org/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/caseyneillandthenorwayrats\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/caseyneill\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"caseyneill\"},{\"id\":1765201,\"name\":\"Jim Brunberg\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1765202,\"name\":\"Ashleigh Flynn\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1765203,\"name\":\"Silver Ships\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1765204,\"name\":\"Kasey Anderson\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1767237,\"name\":\"Ezra Holbrook\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Ezra Holbrook is one of the Northwest's best songwriters, with an authentic and moving collection of songs that reflect on themes of redemption, forgiveness and love with heartfelt vocals and accomplished guitar work.
