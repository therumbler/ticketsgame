a new vitality to classic funk, matching their smooth and soulful grooves with a hip-hop-inspired urgency and mastery of beat. Now, on their fourth studio album Crush, drummer Adam Deitch, guitarists Adam Smirnoff and Eric Krasno, bassist Erick \u201cJesus\u201d Coomes, keyboardist Neal Evans, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet player Eric Bloom deepen that sound by channeling the sonic freedom and infectious energy of their incendiary live show.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Lettuce and recorded/mixed by Joel Hamilton at Brooklyn\u2019s Studio G, Crush first came to life on the road, with the band developing new material and testing it out live as they toured. \u201cWe\u2019ve all noticed that our music goes into a lot of different directions onstage, and we wanted to capture that in a way that we never really have before,\u201d says Coomes, who names classic psychedelia and \u201890s hip-hop among Lettuce\u2019s key inspirations on Crush. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more wide-open in terms style, but it still stays true to the funk.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe follow-up to 2012\u2019s Fly, Crush finds Lettuce brilliantly infusing their psychedelic and hip-hop sensibilities into bass-heavy funk. With its spidery guitar work and hypnotic beats, \u201cPhyllis\u201d is a delicately sprawling epic that embodies what Deitch refers to as \u201ca chill-hop vibe that\u2019s kind of the flip-side of all that powerful uptempo funk that people might expect from us.\u201d On \u201cGet Greasy,\u201d Lettuce give a nod to the groove-fueled EDM subgenre known as future funk, building off its highly danceable rhythm with a blissfully loose and horn-laced arrangement. And on \u201cHe Made a Woman Out of Me,\u201d guest vocalist Alecia Chakour lends her bluesy growl to a scorching take on Bobbie Gentry\u2019s 1970 country-soul classic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Lettuce, that sense of unity and togetherness has much to do with a camaraderie that\u2019s only intensified over the lifespan of the band. Formed in 1992, when several band members attended a summer program at Boston\u2019s Berklee College of Music as teenagers, Lettuce was founded on a shared love of legendary funk artists like Earth, Wind & Fire and Tower of Power. After returning to Berklee as undergrads in 1994, Lettuce started playing in local clubs and steadily built up a following that soon extended to cities across the country and then throughout the world. Releasing their studio debut Outta Here in 2002 and its follow-up album Rage! in 2009, the band dedicated the coming years to balancing their frequent touring with involvement in a host of other musical endeavors (including Evans and Krasno\u2019s role as founding members of acclaimed soul/jazz trio Soulive). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, Lettuce have watched their fan base expand as they\u2019ve hit bigger and bigger stages and earned their name as a can\u2019t-miss festival act. And in making Crush, the band had no trouble harnessing the spirit of their explosive live show. \u201cSome of these shows we\u2019ve played over the past couple years have been so amazing, it\u2019s like you go home a different person,\u201d says Coomes. \u201cI\u2019m sure remembering those moments in our minds and our hearts helped bring out something special when we were recording these new songs.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo while Crush offers everything from all-out party jams to headphone-ready journeys into space funk, each track was born from an unabashed joy and love of live performance. \u201cThat energy we get when it\u2019s prime time and we\u2019re about to go onstage and we\u2019re just excited beyond belief\u2014that all came out on this new album,\u201d says Deitch. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that the band is rising, and it\u2019s a really beautiful thing.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"http://www.amazon.com/Lettuce/e/B000APQNZG/?tag=930clu-20\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.lettucefunk.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/lettucefunk\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/LettuceFunk\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/lettucefunk\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"lettucefunk\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":92675,\"name\":\"Tauk\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"166\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/273427447&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\\\"><\\/iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nOn their third studio album Sir Nebula, TAUK tap into their singular chemistry to elevate and expand their all-instrumental blend of funk, hip-hop, progressive rock, and jazz. Revealing both their refined musicality and unbridled creativity, the Oyster Bay, New York-bred rock-fusion four-piece (guitarist Matt Jalbert, bassist Charlie Dolan, keyboardist/organist Alric \u201cA.C.\u201d Carter, and drummer Isaac Teel) push into new sonic terrain and build entire worlds within each richly textured soundscape.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the hazy atmospherics of \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d and soaring riffs of \u201cProgram Select\u201d to the urgent rhythms of \u201cShenanigans\u201d and sprawling melodies of \u201cWhere You Are,\u201d Sir Nebula finds TAUK introducing a cosmically inspired element to their music. \u201cThe album ended up taking on a more ambient kind of vibe than anything we\u2019ve done before\u2014there\u2019s a spaciness in the songs that lets you get lost in the sound,\u201d says Dolan. And while the album is endlessly hypnotic, TAUK also deliver the dynamic tension-and-release jams that have helped earn them a devoted following while drawing critical acclaim (the Washington Post, for one, praised TAUK for \u201ccreating a hard-charging, often melodic fusion that\u2014thanks to a penchant for improv\u2014offers limitless possibilities\u201d).\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout Sir Nebula\u2014the follow-up to their 2015 live double album HEADROOM\u2014TAUK allow a more free-form, instinct-guided approach to steer their music into bold new directions. \u201cWith this record, we felt more comfortable in the studio and got to a new level where we were able to constantly feed off each other, so there was a lot of spur-of-the-moment improvisation that really helped shape the album,\u201d says Jalbert. Adds Carter: \u201cWe made a point of trying to express ourselves freely and take risks even when that felt challenging and scary, instead of holding ourselves back and possibly taking something away from the songs.\u201d At the same time, TAUK sharpened their songwriting to craft more intricately layered arrangements and powerfully intense grooves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with their past four releases, TAUK created Sir Nebula in collaboration with Grammy Award-winning producer/mixer/engineer Robert Carranza (The Mars Volta, Ozomatli, Jack Johnson, Taj Mahal). But in a departure from their previous work, the band made the album in one concentrated period rather than spacing the recording sessions out in between tours. Holing up at the Solar Powered Plastic Plant in Los Angeles, often pulling 12-hour workdays, TAUK ultimately found the revamped recording process hugely beneficial. \u201cEverything just happened so naturally this time around,\u201d says Jalbert. \u201cI can\u2019t think of one moment where it felt like anything was forced. We were all just completely focused and in the same mindset, which made it this incredibly fun and smooth experience.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTAUK\u2019s creative connection traces back to childhood, when longtime friends Dolan, Jalbert, and Carter formed their first band in seventh grade and held practice in their school basement. After playing together in various projects over the years, the trio brought Teel into the fold in 2012, cementing the final lineup. \u201cWe gelled pretty quickly as friends and as musicians, and now there\u2019s a connection onstage that\u2019s unspoken,\u201d notes Teel. \u201cYou just feel it from the energy within the band and from the response coming from the crowd\u2014all these people in the same exact headspace.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSince their formation, TAUK have shared stages with an impressive list of bands (including Widespread Panic, Umphrey\u2019s McGee, Lettuce, and Tim Reynolds & TR3), in addition to appearing at festivals like Electric Forest, Bonnaroo, and The Allman Brothers\u2019 Peach Music Festival. That rigorous touring schedule has gone a long way in strengthening their chemistry, according to Carter. \u201cWe\u2019re doing 140 shows a year and we pretty much live with each other, so there\u2019s a healthy respect and trust and love happening there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all have a common goal and an understanding that this is something we\u2019re compelled to do, and that\u2019s definitely brought us close together.\u201d It\u2019s also helped TAUK develop a reputation as a masterful live act: \u201cTAUK is unstoppable,\u201d raved Live for Live Music. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t see them, dear God, go.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow on the road again (with upcoming dates including a two-night stint at the Brooklyn Bowl and spots on the Hangtown Music Festival, North Coast Music Festival, and Catskill Chill Music Festival), TAUK also have plans to widen their output by composing scores for film and television. In the meantime, the band is focused on instilling their live show with the same kinetic energy and boundless passion that powered the making of Sir Nebula. \u201cGrowing up together as musicians and collectively going on this journey\u2014that\u2019s what makes this experience really special,\u201d says Jalbert of TAUK\u2019s continued evolution. \u201cIt\u2019s like everything we\u2019ve learned over the years has been funneled into this band, and now it\u2019s taking shape in a really exciting way. We all love what we\u2019re doing, and the band just feels like home.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":641},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1367},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/72/60-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"http://www.amazon.com/Tauk/e/B001LIAWDK/?tag=930clu-20\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.taukband.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/tauk\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/taukband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/taukband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"taukband\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1376452?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
