Rosenstock\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"It's almost midnight on a Saturday in the summer, and I live in New York City. I'm still in my 30s\\nand I don't have to get up early tomorrow. By anyone's standards, I should be heading out for the\\nnight; dancing, drinking, meeting up with old friends, making new friends, making mistakes, and\\nfeeling young in a city that allows you to remain young despite your age growing higher. I should\\nbe\u00a0out\u00a0there\u00a0living.\\nInstead, I just put a load of laundry in the machine in my building's basement. I'm wearing a pair\\nof green shorts and I feel like an asshole in them. I have knobby knees and shorts don't look good\\non me. I am wearing a light green t\u00adshirt and the whole outfit makes me vaguely feel like a\\nmiddle\u00adaged man dressed up for his first day of kindergarten. I am going nowhere tonight, and I\\nsuspect\u00a0this\u00a0may\u00a0apply\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0long\u00a0term\u00a0as\u00a0well.\\nThis\u00a0seems\u00a0like\u00a0the\u00a0perfect\u00a0time\u00a0to\u00a0write\u00a0about\u00a0Jeff\u00a0Rosenstock\u200b.\\nBecause no one I've ever met creates art that encapsulates this state of mind more than Jeff. It's\\nmusic that's catchier than any other music, music you can scream along to in a joyous frenzy. But\\nsimultaneously, if you really listen to the lyrics you're shouting, they can speak to a loneliness and\\ndesperation so profound it's soul crushing. I've lost myself in joy to Jeff's songs and I've sat alone\\ndepressed to Jeff's songs, and I've felt both those things to the same song, sometimes on back to\\nback\u00a0listens.\\nNobody can take the exhilaration and possibilities of life and balance them with the depression of\\na laundry room on a Saturday night like Jeff Rosenstock. His music can be like a funeral taking\\nplace inside a bouncy house, or like a kids' birthday party taking place inside a morgue. I say that\\nwith\u00a0the\u00a0utmost\u00a0sincerity\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0intent\u00a0to\u00a0offer\u00a0only\u00a0the\u00a0highest\u00a0of\u00a0praise.\\nIf you're reading this, you probably know the legend of Jeff Rosenstock by now. The Arrogant\\nSons of Bitches had Long Island's attention, and then mutated into Bomb the Music Industry, a\\ncollection of musicians that were among the first to just give their music away, that spray painted\\nt\u00adshirts for fans, that did everything in a way that was financially ill\u00adadvised and built a cult unlike\\nany other in the process. Sometimes their shows had a dozen musicians on stage, sometimes it\\nwas Jeff and an ipod. No matter what, there was always one thing that remained the same \u2013 this\\nband had as much integrity as Fugazi with none of the pretension but with all the emotion but\\nwith a lot more fun and also I have to reiterate none of the pretension. To me it seems like Bomb\\nwas like Fugazi if the members of Fugazi had been willing to let down their guards and laugh at\\nfart jokes. Again, this is meant as high praise. I really like Fugazi and am not trying to talk shit, it's\\njust\u00a0an\u00a0apt\u00a0metaphor.\\nWhen Bomb ended, Jeff was left standing in a lonely spotlight and we all wondered if he'd be ok.\\nInstead of even giving us time to find out, he put out We Cool? and showed us all what growing up\\nlooks like. Growing up fucking sucks, but it's not for melodramatic reasons. It sucks because your\\njoints start hurting and you know you probably aren't gonna get some of the things done that\\nyou've always promised yourself you're gonna get done and you still have a lot of guilt about\\ndumb shit you pulled when you were like 19. We Cool? showed us that Jeff Rosenstock's version\\nof growing up wasn't going to betray Bomb or its fans or the things people loved about them, it\\nwas going to put a magnifying glass on his own impulses and insecurities as an individual in a\\nway\u00a0that\u00a0was\u00a0both\u00a0shockingly\u00a0frank\u00a0and\u00a0impossibly\u00a0catchy.\\nJeff's music, if you ask me, is for people who really and truly feel like they could change the world,\\nif only they could muster up the strength to leave the fucking house. It's for people who get into\\ngroup situations and have every instinct inside their heads scream that the world is a fucked up\\nand terrifying place and they should crumble up into a corner and wait to die, but who instead\\ndance like idiots because what the fuck else is there to do? It's music that makes me feel like\\nmaybe, just maybe, if I do things the right way I can help make the world a better place, while\\nco\u00adexisting with the knowledge that I don't fucking matter and there's no reason not to give up,\\nexcept maybe I shouldn't because what if deep down people are actually beautiful, giving, and\\nkind?\\nIt's music that makes me lose myself like I used to when I was 13 and first discovered the joy of\\npunk rock, but it's also music that makes me think way too fucking hard about why the world is\\nhow it is and if I might be someone with enough heart to throw a few punches in the effort to\\nmake\u00a0shit\u00a0just\u00a0a\u00a0tiny\u00a0bit\u00a0better\u00a0for\u00a0others\u00a0for\u00a0one\u00a0fucking\u00a0second\u00a0of\u00a0one\u00a0fucking\u00a0day.\\nIt's\u00a0simple\u00a0punk\u00a0rock.\u00a0It's\u00a0also\u00a0complicated\u00a0and\u00a0beautiful\u00a0and\u00a0working\u00a0class\u00a0and\u00a0perfect.\\nIs the above a little cheesy? Sure. But I think it's true and I think it's all worth saying. Because\\nhaving become friends with Jeff over the past few years, I can say the following with great\\ncertainty \u2013 he actually is what he says he is. And because of that, all the above applies. His\\nintegrity is untouchable. We all need to take a second and appreciate how much time this guy has\\nwasted finding all ages venues. How much money he has passed on to retain his credibility as an\\nartist. If other artists \u2013 myself chief among them \u2013 conducted themselves with an ounce of the\\nintegrity\u00a0Jeff\u00a0approaches\u00a0all\u00a0areas\u00a0of\u00a0art\u00a0and\u00a0life\u00a0with,\u00a0the\u00a0world\u00a0would\u00a0be\u00a0a\u00a0better\u00a0place.\\nI know this might sound silly to people who don't get it \u2013 they might say \\\"It's just punk rock, calm\\ndown.\\\" \u2013 but fuck those people, we all know Jeff is a musical genius. If he wanted to go ghost write\\nsongs for Taylor Mars and Bruno Swift, I bet he could make millions of dollars doing so. Music is\\neasy for him. He could write empty songs and hand them off to hollow artists and we all know\\nhe'd kill it and he wouldn't have to deal with shaking down shady promoters for a few hundred\\nbucks or driving overnight to get to the next venue or stressing about paying bills or any of it. He\\ncontinues to not do any of that easy shit and that's because he's not bullshitting about doing\\nthings not just the right way, but in a way that's more idealistic than reality actually allows for. He\\ndoes\u00a0that\u00a0for\u00a0us.\\nThe guy is a genius poet while simultaneously being the definition of a fucking goon from Long\\n\u200b Island. There is nothing not to love. The album you are about to listen to, WORRY., only furthers\\nand exceeds the myth of Jeff Rosenstock, he who is mythical for being the most normal dude from\\na boring place any of us have ever met; mythical for sticking to his guns when all logic points in\\nthe other direction; mythical for writing melodies that stick in our brains and lyrics that rip our\\nguts out; mythical most of all for being not mythical at all. He's just Jeff. It's not that complicated.\\nBut in a world where everything is driven by branding and image and hidden agendas, being not\\nthat\u00a0complicated\u00a0makes\u00a0him\u00a0perhaps\u00a0the\u00a0most\u00a0complicated\u00a0artist\u00a0I\u00a0know.\\nEnjoy this album. Enjoy it as a whole. The second half is going to blow your mind with its\\nambitiousness \u2013 in my opinion the second half of this album will be viewed over time as a\\ntriumph and high water mark of a cool ass career. And the singles \u2013 \\\"Wave Goodnight to Me\\\" \u200bis\\nuntouchable. \\\"Blast Damage Days\\\" will make you feel ok about the fact that the world seems to\\nbe\u00a0built\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0foundation\u00a0of\u00a0quicksand.\\nAnd when you're done listening, don't forget \u2013 you probably can't change the world, but you're\\nkind of a dick if you don't at least try. Jeff's been falling on the sword for the rest of us for years\\nand\u00a0it's\u00a0on\u00a0all\u00a0of\u00a0us\u00a0to\u00a0at\u00a0least\u00a0go\u00a0down\u00a0swinging.\\nSincerely,\\nChris\u00a0Gethard\\nPS\u00a0\u2013\u00a0John\u00a0DeDomenici\u00a0ain't\u00a0bad\u00a0either.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atjmbo.jpeg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":399},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atjmbo1.jpeg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":399},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atlg.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atlg1.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atmd.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atmd1.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-og.jpeg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":399},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atsm.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atsm1.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-sq.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-sqsm.jpeg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atxl.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atxxl.jpeg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":399},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/27/91-atxxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":399}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://jeffrosenstock.bandcamp.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/jeffrosenstockmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/JeffRosenstock\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"JeffRosenstock\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":933221,\"name\":\"Hard Girls\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Max and Morgan were in Pteradon, Mike was in Shinobu, now all three are in Hard Girls.
