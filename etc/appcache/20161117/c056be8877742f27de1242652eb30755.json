The Nashville six-piece has been melting faces since its debut 7\u201d Aloha first started making waves outside the leafy campus of Belmont University, where its members first met. What started as a dorm room dick joke between two friends bored by the music-business ladder-climbing of their classmates has grown into one of the biggest\u2014and loudest\u2014rock acts to come out of Nashville since their big bros and labelmates in JEFF The Brotherhood. As they toured the country behind their critically acclaimed 2013 LP I\u2019m Rich Beyond Your Wildest Dreams, the likes of Billboard, Rolling Stone, SPIN, and even BuzzFeed have taken notice. Ignore them at your own peril.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn their latest LP for Infinity Cat Recordings, Turn to Gold, the Planet boys worked with Vance Powell, the Grammy-winning engineer and Jack White confidant. Powell used his expertise in recording live sound to capture some of the energy of the Diarrhea Planet live experience\u2014they tracked the main guitar and drum tracks live, in the same room, for a record that\u2019s both massive and frenetic. It\u2019s easily the most sophisticated and complex music they\u2019ve ever made, but still carries the joyous irreverence that minted thousands of RAWK fans across the country. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe band\u2019s rhythm section, which features drummer Ian Bush (a.k.a. Tuff Gus) and bassist Mike Boyle, is the bedrock on which the foundation is built, but what makes Diarrhea Planet explode is the raw power of its four guitars. Not one note is wasted, and each ax slinger plays a role; Jordan Smith writes soaring power pop singalong hooks; Brent Toler brings a classic rock sensibility and chunky, fuzzy riffs; Emmett Miller\u2019s wields classical training and a wizard-like five-finger pick-less technique for mind-bending, finger-tapping solos; and Evan Bird is the glue that holds them all together, capable of playing any part (or instrument) as needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiarrhea Planet is a nationally touring band, playing a punishing schedule of more than 200 shows a year. But they cut their teeth in the clubs and house shows of the Nashville DIY scene, built by the likes of JEFF, Heavy Cream, Natural Child, Pujol, and shaped in legendary spaces like the old police precinct that would come to be known as Glenn Danzig\u2019s House. As they\u2019ve graduated from living rooms to clubs to festivals, the energy has remained constant\u2014just ask the ladies in the mosh pit or the crowdsurfing dads you\u2019re sure to find at any Diarrhea Planet show. They\u2019re carrying the torch for the past, present and future of rock, and you\u2019d be wise to take notice\u2014everyone else sure has.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":455},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":455},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":210},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":140},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-og.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":455},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":70},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":350},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":455},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/02/67-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/111296062&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\\\"><\\/iframe>\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"420\\\" height=\\\"236\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V0T2TgxTTmk?list=PLXkb45DXhwofvsazVCo_tW6aHEHpZ9Jg-\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.diarrheaplanet.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/DiarrheaPlanet\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/DiarrheaPlanet\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"DiarrheaPlanet\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1709659,\"name\":\"Lovely Bad Things\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Brought together by time and fate\u2014they'd all known each other since high school, but finally made a band together in 2009\u2014and named by some kind of esoteric computer filename error too complex to further explain, Orange County's The Lovely Bad Things are the hyperactive omnitalented and relentlessly hilarious garage-pop band who crowdfunded their way to an encore performance at the world-famous Primavera Sound festival and whose new album The Late Great Whatever was titled during a dream at the suggestion of their spirit guide, who happens to look strangely like Dinosaur Jr drummer Murph. Was that a lot to take in all at once? Then now you can sympathize with the cop who pulled them over on their way to the UFO museum in Roswell, New Mexico: \\\"'Who here has ADD?'\\\" Brayden Ward remembers him asking. \\\"And we all raised our hands.\\\"\\n\\nThe Lovely Bad Things are Brayden and brother Camron Ward, Tim Hatch and Lauren Curtius, each a multi-instrumentalist and each devoted to a bottomless knowledge of ridiculous pop culture and comprehensive appreciation for the Pixies, though if you dismantled their songs and their record collections both you'd find Sonic Youth, Modest Mouse, the B-52s, the Wipers and of course Redd Kross, whose sense of humor and sense for a hook the Bad Things have inherited. They mostly come from the city of La Mirada, but their true home is the Lovely Bad Pad, a converted suburban garage\u2014converted personally by the band members\u2014that's hosted truly legendary backyard punk shows, up to and including a surprise set by Peter, Bjorn and John, who know a good thing when they hear it.\\n\\nIt's this combination of D.I.Y. spirit and off-the-wall luck that carried The Lovely Bad Things from that backyard to a cassette release on trendsetter label Burger Records that would be called one of the best L.A. punk releases of 2011 by the L.A. Weekly. And from there they ricocheted into a surprise slot at Primavera Sound festival, crowdfunding and benefit-showing just barely enough for airfare to get there and winning over their audience forever once they did. Now, after building a fan base show by show and person by frothing-at-the-mouth person\u2014a guy once came all the way from Belgium to see them play one special song\u2014The Lovely Bad Things have finished The Late Great Whatever for Volcom Entertainment.\\n\\nThe Late Great Whatever was started just after the release of the maxi-EP New Ghost/Old Waves, until now the Lovely Bad Things' signature release. Although they'd released a full-length called Shark Week in 2010, the album that would become \u2026Whatever was going to be something new, they explain: \\\"Our first real full-length,\\\" says Tim. At least half of Shark Week's songs were written in \u2026 oh, about two minutes, calculates Lauren, because back then Lovely Bad Things were just discovering the knockout sugar high that came from just playing music with each other. But this would be different: \\\"How do I say it and not sound like a super-clich\u00e9 musician?\\\" asks Camron. \\\"More mature, I guess?\\\"\\n\\nSo what's that mean? Not one but two Star Wars references on the tracklist, Bigfoot on the cover, a shout-out to Macho Man Randy Savage and a relentless collection of the strongest songs The Lovely Bad Things have ever done. What, did you think \\\"mature\\\" meant? They were going to get all mopey and slow? (\\\"Just say it's 'globular' and 'shapeshifting,'\\\" suggests Camron.)  Produced by Jon Gilbert in the studio built and run by Crystal Antlers' frontman Jonny Bell, this is a record by a band who've developed a telepathic language of their own, with songs that stop and start and turn inside out in ways you just can't play unless you know exactly what everyone else in the studio with you is thinking.\\n\\nOn The Late Great Whatever, Lovely Bad Things roll out just about anything you'd want about 15% faster than you'd expect. Do they do it all? They indeed do it all. They have stormers like \\\"Kessel Run\\\" and the stand-out \\\"Randall the Savage,\\\" which is all jittery post-punky guitar and gradually building insanity. Then they have sweetheart pop-punk like \\\"Maybe I Know,\\\" which is born for the best mixtapes of 2013. They have surf's-up guitar (\\\"Styx And Branches\\\") and wah-wah guitar (\\\"Oozin It\\\") and oh-my-God-I'm-being-attacked-by-furious-bees guitar (\\\"Kessel Run\\\").  They have Frank Black-style spoken-word stammer (\\\"Fried Eyes\\\") and cooled-out Kim Deal back-ups. And those heartbreaker harmonies that are part of what make The Lovely Bad Things so special? Pretty much everywhere, thanks to Lauren's gift for melody, but why don't you go right to \\\"Rope Swing\\\" if you need 'em right away? And if this still seems like a lot to take in at once, don't worry\u2014down some (or too much) caffeine, roll down the windows and let The Late Great Whatever take the wheel. Just watch out for the cops on the way to the UFO museum. When they hear music like this, they pay way too much attention.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":456},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":456},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":274},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":182},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-og.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":456},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":91},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":456},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":456},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/52/01-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thelovelybadthings.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"https://myspace.com/thelovelybadthings\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/lovelybadthings\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/LovelyBadTweets\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"LovelyBadTweets\"},{\"id\":1663789,\"name\":\"Trendy Dad\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Trendy Dad are your friendly neighborhood Budget Rock band.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.trendydadband.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/trendydad\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.theindependentsf.com/event/1282309?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
