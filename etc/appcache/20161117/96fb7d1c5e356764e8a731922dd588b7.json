path to self-discovery is often littered with obstacles \u2013 a journey one must make on his or her own terms. This was no different for K.Flay, who found her sound only after climbing over more than a handful of roadblocks. The indie hip-hop musician, born Kristine Flaherty, had released two mix tapes and three EPs, but was trapped on the roster of a major label that wouldn't commit to an album. So at the end of 2013, Flay unhooked herself from the label and began writing songs for what would become the most cohesive, truest representation of herself \u2013 her debut album, Life As A Dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to leaving the label, K.Flay had been living in San Francisco and then Brooklyn. In January, she left her apartment and holed up in a rehearsal space in downtown Los Angeles, isolating herself to see what sort of songs emerged. What had previously been a discouraging spiral was remedied by the process of making music without expectations or preconceptions. She found herself more awake, reinvigorated by the inspiration behind her songwriting. \\\"I started sending demos to my manager,\\\" K.Flay says. \\\"It felt natural. It felt like this was the sound. I think of this album as a return to where my head was at when I first got signed. It's still a hip hop record but it's also an alternative record, a pop record.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe songs were inspired by experiences during, and surrounding, K.Flay's extensive touring, both with artists like Passion Pit, Icona Pop, 3Oh!3 and Theophilus London, and at festivals like Bonnaroo, Outside Lands and Governor's Ball. \\\"For me, the live show is the crux of the project. It's that moment when anything is possible, when people interact with your songs in an entirely visceral & unpredictable way.\\\" It was the fans she made along the way that helped fund the recording process. When Flaherty asked her supporters for help in putting out the record, her crowd-funding campaign goal was reached in only six days.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife As A Dog is imbued with that sense of betterment as K.Flay tries to reconcile the tension between being up to no good and also searching to find the good in everything. \\\"There's a hopefulness to the songs, like, 'I fucked up today but I can do better tomorrow,'\\\" explains Flaherty. \\\"Can't Sleep,\\\" a propulsive, moody number, reflects on the anxiety of missing out, and how that can lead to self-destruction. \\\"Wishing It Was You\\\" harkens back to the musician's youth, inspired by her admiration for Liz Phair's Exile In Guyville. \\\"Thicker Than Dust\\\" is an ode to friendship, a thumping recollection of the people K.Flay has connected with during her years of travel. A handful of these friends became the collaborators for the album, including Billboard (Robyn, B.o.B., Britney Spears), Justyn Pilbrow (The Neighbourhood) and Sam Spiegel (Maroon 5, N.A.S.A), and K.Flay laid the tracks down in LA, New York and San Francisco, which she refers to as the \\\"epicenters\\\" of her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith her debut album in hand, K.Flay now embarks on this year's 20th Anniversary of Vans Warped Tour. She will continue touring through the end of the year, doing what she loves best \u2013 bringing her energetic live show to new and old fans alike.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":720},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":225},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":150},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-og.jpg\",\"width\":2000,\"height\":1500},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":75},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":375},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":488},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/97/93-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.kflay.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/kflay\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/kflaymusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/kflay\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"kflay\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1740621,\"name\":\"Nightly\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"alt pop outfit emerging out of Nashville, TN. soundtrack to our youth. night, love you.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1754225,\"name\":\"Layne\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"For Layne Putnam, music has always been an autobiographical journey, one influenced as much by her personal \\nexperiences as outside forces. From the growing pains of her days as a budding musician deep in search of her \\ntruest identity and message to her blossomed sound of today, LAYNE represents the evolved stage of the \\nmodern-day artist. \\n\\nPutnam made a name for herself as an undiscovered talent tapped from the far off lands in her hometown in the \\nBlack Hills of South Dakota. Those formative years in the isolated mountain range set the building blocks for the \\nbeginning of the LAYNE style, which was heavily influenced by the geographic imprint of her rural upbringing. \\nFrom the get-go, Putnam has absorbed inspiration from her immediate surroundings and grew up with a \\npenchant for arts, culture, and architecture foreign to many youth her age. Her introduction to music was partly \\ndriven by her musician father, Kenny Putnam, who spent years touring with country icon Roy Clark. It makes \\nsense, then, that for her music became a daily institution. It seemed Putnam was destined for the life of a \\nmusician. \\n\\n\\\"Music has always been the constant in my life,\\\" says Layne Putnam. \\\"It's always been there for me, and it \\nalways will be. It's always been my purpose and reason and the one thing that no one could ever take \\naway from me. Growing up until now, it's been my power, my identity, and my best friend.\\\" \\n\\nAs with any genuine artist, age begets change, and for Putnam that meant a life transforming, cross-country \\nrelocation to her new and current home in Los Angeles. There, through a casual encounter in a coffee shop, \\nPutnam would meet drummer Alexander Rosca, a session player from Portland, OR. They would bond over \\nsimilar tastes in music, style, and similarities in the places they once called home. It's in the City of Angels where \\nthese messengers of music found and perfected their crafty and heartfelt take of indie pop powered by moody, \\nemotion-laden rock. \\n\\nWhereas her South Dakota roots were her sonic foundation, Los Angeles is Putnam's most captivating muse. For \\na spin, take a cue from \\\"Good,\\\" which reflects the spirit of a persevering artist breaking her way into the world \\none song at a time. It's a life path also encapsulated in their breakthrough single, \\\"Somebody,\\\" which captures \\nthe everyday struggles of the starving musician in both audio and visual format via the official music video. \\n\\nNow, with her unfeigned voice in tow and teamed with producer Devon Corey and drummer Alexander Rosca \\ndriving her most critical sound, plus paired with a new home providing a daily inspirational backdrop, LAYNE \\nsets forth with their latest single, \\\"Good\\\", out April 8th via Taste & Tone. \\n\\n\\\"'Good' is a small introduction to some of the music I've been writing over the past year while living in \\nLos Angeles,\\\" says Putnam. \\\"We're all looking to be understood, and this song, along with our EP \\n(expected May), is where we can feel alone together. We call that place the 'In-Between.'\\\" \\n\\nTHE BLACK HILLS EP represents the latest and most entrancing chapter in the book of LAYNE. Time will only tell \\nhow far this burgeoning band will travel in search of the perfect song. What's left is the soundtrack to a life on \\nthe road with never an end in sight.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/laynesounds\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/laynesworld\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Laynesworld_\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Laynesworld_\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1291911?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
