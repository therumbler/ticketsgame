Coalition\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Virginia Coalition is a band that has made its reputation with the blazing energy of its live shows and ability to play almost any style of music. Home This Year sees the band moving in a new direction. They\u201fve blended their diverse influences into a sound all their own with a maturity and attention to detail that shines on every track.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band\u201fs core members - Andy Poliakoff, lead vocals, guitar; Paul Ottinger, keyboards, percussion, guitar, vocals and Jarrett Nicolay, bass, guitar, banjo, vocals \u2013 have always delighted fans with their ability to confound expectations. On previous albums, their songs often featured arrangements that veered off in unanticipated directions moving from funk to rock, from go go to soul. \u201cIt\u201fs good being eclectic,\u201d says Poliakoff, the band\u201fs main lyricist and frequent spokesperson. \u201cIt keeps you on your toes musically, and it\u201fs fun, but we wanted to get back to some serious songwriting. In the past few years, we were writing for the live shows, endless groove things that are far from what we wrote when we were starting out. We wanted to get back to that original creative impulse and focus on our songwriting.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band ventured cross country to California and got to work, challenging themselves to find a more emotionally intense means of expression. \u201cThere\u201fs a value to the time you put into a project,\u201d Poliakoff explains. \u201cWe didn\u201ft allow ourselves to be satisfied with the first, or even third version of a song. We\u201fre getting older, and we wanted more than bombast. We wanted to look outside ourselves and find something more reflective, more truthful, more universal, to open a new chapter in the band\u201fs songwriting history.\u201d For the first time, they collaborated with other songwriters, including Brooklyn folk-rocker Ari Hest, New Orleans-based bluesman Anders Osborne, Maia Sharp who wrote \u201cA Home\u201d for the Dixie Chicks, and the album\u201fs Producer, Marshall Altman (Marc Broussard, Matt Nathanson).\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cMarshall is a phenomenal musician,\u201d Poliakoff says. \u201cHis ability to tweak the arrangements and get us deeper into the music and our emotions was outstanding. He was there the whole time, pushing us to do better.\u201d Ottinger adds his praise: \u201cHe\u201fs a strong songwriter and arranger. Every time you\u201fd pick up a guitar and sing, he\u201fd get down to every hook, every chord, every lyric. \u201eIs that a strong emotion?\u201f \u201eIs that what you really want to say?\u201f He helped us blend all our influences into a voice that\u201fs new, but still reflects our past.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe songs on Home This Year showcase the band\u201fs remarkable growth as both musicians and songwriters. The title track is a tale of the loneliness and yearning that haunts the road. \u201cBeing on the road away from your family and friends for a long period can be tangibly painful,\\\" sites Poliakoff, \\\"'Home This Year' embodies that sentiment and how singing about it can help make you feel closer to home.\\\" \u201cSing Along,\u201d written with Altman, is an uplifting, anthemic song, on which Poliakoff delivers one of his most soulful vocals, both tender and passionate. It is also the first tune they\u201fve ever cut with a string section. \u201cIt was written with a conscious desire to connect with the audience,\u201d Poliakoff explains. \u201cWe play music, but we\u201fre not different from our audience. We don\u201ft want people to idolize us, we want to get people to have a sense of togetherness.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cNot Scared,\u201d penned with Hest, is the most political track on the album, although its message of love across racial lines is subtle and nuanced. \u201cThe song had to remain small and honest for the story to be conveyed sincerely,\u201d says Nicolay. \u201cSo we used small scale acoustic guitars from the 1960's and kept the focus on the words and melody.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cSanta Fe,\u201d the first song the band wrote together for the album, is a rootsy song with a pop sensibility, full of chiming guitars (with guest Eric Robinson), tasteful mandolin (supplied by Dave Immergluck of Counting Crows), country flavored piano, banjo played in an unorthodox, non-bluegrass style and a driving beat (provided by Aaron Sterling) that brings it all together. \u201cIt\u201fs a reminder that every moment is fleeting,\u201d says Poliakoff. \u201cJust when you\u201fve got something figured out, it seems to slip away.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-time Virginia Coalition fans may be surprised by the group\u201fs evolution from \u201espontaneous anything goes\u201f band to introspective, soul-searching songwriters, but it\u201fs a change the band welcomes. \u201cWe\u201fve known each other for 15 years now, and while the music is still getting better, we don\u201ft want to keep writing the same song over and over,\u201d Poliakoff states firmly. \u201cI\u201fm proud to be part of a group of three friends who have gone from the basement and garage to maturity and making music that speaks from the heart. It\u201fs a struggle to make a great album, but we welcomed the opportunity to reinvent ourselves while staying true to the core of what we do.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nVirginia Coalition started building a buzz in their hometown of Alexandria, Virginia in the late \u201e90s, releasing their first album, The Colors of the Sound, in 1998. But the three principals are life long friends who have known each other since high school, and in the case of Ottinger and Nicolay, since junior high. Ottinger wanted to be in a band since he was five years old, when his mother let him paint his face like Paul Stanley of Kiss and play air guitar with a tennis racket. Poliakoff had a guitar-playing cousin, who inspired him in the 4th grade. When he was 14, his mother was struck with cancer and eventually died; music and singing provided him with an emotional release. Nicolay\u201fs father played classical guitar. Although he was intimidated, he\u201fd sneak away from the family and pick out melodies on his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2003 the band had three independent albums in their pocket and maintained an intense touring schedule, selling some 60,000 albums, mostly from the edge of the stage. bluhammock music inked the band and released OK to Go in 2004, as they moved from regional to national tours. Last year\u201fs Live at The 9:30 Club finally captured the band\u201fs live intensity and set in motion the musical soul searching that produced Home This Year.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking the music back to their songwriting roots on Home This Year has imbued the trio with a new sense of purpose. The gigs they\u201fve been doing to prepare for the album release have been drawing raves, leaving fans awed with their emotional and musical intensity. With this new album in hand, the band is ready to write the next chapter in the history of Virginia Coalition.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/65/15-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"ldiUUX3t9OY\",\"title\":\"virginia coalition | hurricane song\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ldiUUX3t9OY\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"SFAPOtoikLg\",\"title\":\"Virginia Coalition - Sing Along\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFAPOtoikLg\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ldiUUX3t9OY\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.virginiacoalition.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Virginia-Coalition/14037801666\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/VACoalitionband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"VACoalitionband\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":942869,\"name\":\"Opening Act TBA\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1336887?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
