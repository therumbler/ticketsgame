Fall accompanied by up-and-coming kraut/prog rock band Hedersleben. Following what has been widely regarded as the most ambitious album of his career, one that MOJO called \\\"a sprawling but polished album,\\\" Space Fusion Odyssey, Turner continues his astonishing career rebirth with a newly reinvigorated sense of musical creativity and sonic exploration.\\r\\nFrequently called \\\"The Spirit Of Hawkwind,\\\" Turner was a major creative force during that group's most critically acclaimed and successful period, 1969-1976. His outlandish costumes, improvised sax and flute playing, and general wild man persona became iconic representations of the band, and we would go on to pen some of their most popular songs including \\\"Brainstorm\\\" and \\\"Master of the Universe.\\\" After leaving Hawkwind, Turner used his newfound freedom to travel to Egypt, where he soaked up the history and culture, and also made a recording of his flute music in the King's Chamber of the Great Pyramid of Cheops. In 1985, Turner relocated to the western side of Wales, where he set up a new age community in a fairly rural, isolated area. He has continued to release new music including 2013's Space Gypsy and 2015's Space Fusion Odyssey. A brand new track from his forthcoming studio album premieres on a special 6CD box set called Space Rock: An Interstellar Traveler's Guide. This incredible collection features a diverse sampling of space rock artists young and old including Hawkwind, Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II, Ozric Tentacles, Gong, Can, Earthling Society, and Hedersleben along with a whole host of others!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1429},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":446},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":298},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-og.jpg\",\"width\":1376,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":149},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":744},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":967},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/73/25-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.nikturner.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/NikTurnermusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1728839,\"name\":\"Hedersleben\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Hedersleben\\r\\nHedersleben, a 1970\u2019s style Krautrock band, had its genesis in the German village of the same name in 2012. There, a few kilometers from the historic city of Quedlinburg, Nicky Garratt set up a space to play music in the great tradition of the German rock pioneers. Based now in northern California, the members of Hedersleben have been quite fluid but the dedication to Progressive Rock remains the binding force of the band. \\r\\nAside from the Hedersleben\u2019s three highly acclaimed albums, Upgoer (2013), Die Neuen Welten (2014) and The Fall Of Chronopolis (2015), they have recorded with Hawkwind\u2019s Nik Turner (Space Gypsy), backing him on three US tours, and recorded with Joel Vandroogenbroeck as Brainticket. (Past, Present and Future). 2016 sees the release of Hedersleben 4 \u2013 Orbit in time for their fourth national tour.\\r\\nAlicia Previn / Violin & Vocals\\r\\nIn the early '70s as a young teenager, Alicia (aka Lovely) Previn played in a number of bands associated with The Source Family in Los Angeles, including the infamous Yahowha 13 and also Breath.

His numerous recording credits include work with the late Steve Mackay (The Stooges) and Scott Thunes (former musical director for Frank Zappa).\\r\\n\\r\\nNicky Garratt / Guitars   \\r\\nNicky Garratt began a career in music during the progressive rock explosion of the early '70s in England. He studied classical guitar under Katherine Warner, playing Bach at the Leicester Festival of Music in 1975 and 1976. After moving to London, Garratt joined the UK Subs in 1977. National chart and international touring success quickly followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 40 years, Garratt returned to progressive rock as musical director and guitar player for Hawkwind\u2019s Nik Turner and underground Swiss prog legends Brainticket.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald \u201cDoc\u201d Miller / Bass Guitar & Vocals \\r\\nLos Angeles-born Doc Miller studied guitar, Javanese Gamelan, and music theory at CalArts before moving to the Bay Area in 2007 and putting all into practice in countless west-coast venues.

When in 2012 Garratt became the music director for Hawkwind's Nik Turner the opportunity to reunite with drummer Jason Willer - both were former members of UK Subs of which Garratt was a founder, co-writer and producer (1977 \u2013 1983 and again 1996 \u2013 2011) - presented itself. While working on Turners Space Gypsy album the embryonic Hedersleben began to take shape. \\r\\nMusic: Influenced by the fearless sprit of the early Krautrock scene Hedersleben, augmented by 2nd keyboard player/vocalist Kyrsten Bean, recorded their first album Upgoer in June 2013. Alongside Garratt and Willer, the album features Bryce Shelton from Hollow Mirrors on bass and Kephera Moon from Dragontime on keyboard and vocals. \\r\\nImmediately following Upgoer this line-up of Hedersleben recorded with Joel Vandroogenbroeck as the new album of legendary swiss Krautrock band Brainticket. (Album scheduled for 2014 release). \\r\\nTouring: Hedersleben completed their first US tour Oct/Nov 2013 both opening for and backing Nik Turner. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKephera Moon (keyboards, vocals) is a classically trained musician, composer, and piano instructor.
