The payoff is a unique, gutsy contemplation of performance, its philosophy and practice, expressed in precise, subtle, even paradoxical moments.\u201d Laura Molzahn, The Chicago Tribune (2015)\\r\\n\u201c...dives deep into the underwater caves that form when one person performs for another, and [Shanahan\u2019s]curiosity uncovers phenomena at the microscopic level...Mad Shak-ese is a fluid and spontaneous form of communication, a stream of consciousness format in which one idea flows into the next in endless curling and rippling ribbons of motion.\u201d Sharon Hoyer, New City (2014)\\r\\n\\r\\nDream or nightmare: I arrive at a theater that is also a school. My collaborators are gathered. Strangers, too. There is a familiar tension in the air; it\u2019s exciting and heavy and terrifying. It vibrates with some task I was supposed to complete, but didn\u2019t. Some different person I was intended to become, but haven\u2019t become yet. I\u2019m mute. Quickly I put together a few surreal facts: opening night\u2014or is it an exam? a trial?\u2014is tonight. No, not in three weeks, three months, three years. Now, in fact. I stay silent. I pretend I know exactly what I\u2019m doing. This silence, this pretense, is my greatest discipline yet. I try to appear like my \u201cnormal\u201d self, unfazed. Ready.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nThis evening features new working iterations of three of Shanahan\u2019s ongoing projects: \\r\\nBlackbird\u2019s Ventriloquy, which will premiere in 2017, is an evening-length solo for Shanahan with original score by Kevin O\u2019Donnell. And We Shall Be Rid of Them is Shanahan and Jeff Hancock\u2019s duet collaboration. The pair premiered Rid of Them at the Cultural Center in November, 2015. Their three-year process resulted in a dense archive of materials\u2014movement, text, dialogue\u2014that were shared in intensive rehearsal workshops and across distance (Chicago to Philadelphia, where Shanahan is finishing up a PhD in Dance). The Last Minute is Shanahan\u2019s newest exploration, with Hancock and long-time collaborator Kristina Fluty.\\r\\nTech / Design Credits:\\r\\nLighting design by Joshua Paul Weckesser\\r\\nOriginal music by Kevin O\u2019Donnell\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":608},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":190},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":190},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":127},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":127},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-og.jpg\",\"width\":1406,\"height\":890},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":63},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":63},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":317},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":317},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":411},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/24/33-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":411}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":975589,\"name\":\"Molly Shanahan/Mad Shak\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Molly Shanahan/Mad Shak is an established leader in small-organization experimental contemporary dance in Chicago.

All projects engage multi-media collaborations with composers, videographers, presenter-partners, and community partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreated in Chicago by Canadian-born choreographer Molly Shanahan, Molly Shanahan/Mad Shak has for twenty years provided a facile and adaptable organizational home for Shanahan's movement and performance research and collaborations.

Molly\u2019s work has been supported by two NPN Creation Fund Awards, a Chicago Dancemakers Forum Lab Artist Award, an Illinois Arts Council fellowship for choreography, and a 2010 Meier Achievement Award, among others.

She is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States and currently splits her time between Chicago and Philadelphia, where she teaches at Temple University and Bryn Mawr College, and is writing a dissertation on My Name is a Blackbird.
