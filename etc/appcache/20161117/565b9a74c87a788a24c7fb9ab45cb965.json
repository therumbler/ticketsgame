The hauntingly lovely sounds that comprise its 12 songs are punctuated by a distinct absence of sound, one that elevates the band's music to a new place of depth and emotional poignancy. For the Los Angeles rock band crafting a second album offered an opportunity to expand the ethereal, hypnotic songs on their 2010 debut The Fool and to mirror their extensive live experience on a recording while allowing for the inclusion of more room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group, formed in 2004 by Kokal, Wayman and Lindberg, toured on The Fool for two and half years, solidifying the bond between the musicians over the course of numerous performances around the world. The new album represents Mozgawa's first full collaboration with Warpaint since she jointed shortly before the band recorded The Fool in late 2009, something that augmented the experience this time for everyone involved. The initial work on Warpaint began at a house in Joshua Tree in March of 2012, where the four musicians decamped to write and demo early ideas for the new songs. There was no immediate vision or goal, instead the band wanted to create a meditative place in which to channel inspiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We could come from any direction we wanted,\\\" Kokal says. \\\"Here we'd been playing the same songs over and over again on tour and being in Joshua Tree it was like a dam was released and all this water started flowing out. Recording and writing this album, we really started to play and interact with each other in a new kind of way. It was the natural next level of getting to know each other and discover our album. I think the element of space became kind of a band member, and we were very conscious of not trying to fill in every silent moment anymore.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musicians spent a month in Joshua Tree before returning to Los Angeles, where they continued to write and demo before going into the studio with Flood in January of 2013. The producer, the only person on the band's producer wishlist, joined the group at Five Star Studios in Echo Park for six weeks. The band was drawn to Flood's ability to balance the lo-fi aesthetic of a raw demo with hi-fi production, a sensibility they hoped to embrace when recording the new tracks. In fact, several of the demo pieces made their way onto the final tracks on Warpaint.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I could hear in Flood's work with PJ Harvey that he was comfortable with having a demo-type feeling to the music sometimes but able to translate that on to a greater level of professional sound,\\\" Wayman says. \\\"He's got so much experience under his belt and he's really talented at creating things, making them sound big and luscious. We used a lot of mood-enhancing atmospheric stuff, like synths and electronic drums. We all love hip-hop and trip-hop, which is really mood and rhythm based. That influenced us here.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We wanted to make a sexy record,\\\" Lindberg adds. \\\"Something a little more minimal than The Fool. We had so much to express \u2013 and still do \u2013 but have learned the magic of less is more and truly went in with that frame of mind. We were more mindful and wanted to make room for one another.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resulting album, self-titled because this it the truest expression of Warpaint to date, is vast and beautiful, collecting lush, compelling songs that embody otherworldly tones and hushed pauses. There is a hazy sense of abstraction that pervades, leaving each song lingering as the next begins. \\\"Hi,\\\" which Kokal calls \\\"a really beautiful and dark twist to a very conventional songwriting structure,\\\" shimmers with sparse emotional verve while \\\"Keep It Healthy\\\" explores a meditative groove. \\\"Love Is To Die,\\\" a number that emerged almost directly from a jam session, balances soaring melodies with ambient beats. The album finds all four musicians playing in tandem, and indeed much of the album was recorded live in the studio. It merges disparate influences and sensibilities while eventually landing on a cohesive \u2013 and unexpected \u2013 thematic thread.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Without sounding trite, the subliminal theme of the album is love,\\\" Mozgawa says. \\\"It's a record that meditates on different forms of love in a poetic manner. This wasn't a preconceived theme \u2013 it's just one powerful prevalent thread.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musicians have found a cohesion between this new album, The Fool and their 2009 EP Exquisite Corpse, a sort of evolving symbiosis that always comes back to the strong connection between the four players. The album art, created by Chris Cunningham, reflects the collaborative strength and inherent friendship heard in the songs. Cunningham, who is married to Lindberg, is presently working on a multimedia documentary about the group, which he started while the band was in Joshua Tree last year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We came up with the idea of making a long short film, a mixture of the kinks and quirks of Warpaint and his kinky and quirky brain and ideas,\\\" Lindberg says. \\\"It is going to be a medley of things. Chris is such a mindful and respectful guy. It's been so wonderful to have someone with such impeccable taste and an endless amount of creativity witness all stages of this record.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately Warpaint reveals the next stage of evolution for the group, a truly collaborative effort that showcases both musical growth and a startling depth of friendship. \\\"We thought about this collection of songs like, this is us,\\\" Wayman says. \\\"This is an expression of who we are.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1446},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":452},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":301},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-og.jpg\",\"width\":1360,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":151},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":753},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":979},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/57/01-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"K1BqwONm4TE\",\"title\":\"Warpaint - Whiteout (Official Audio)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1BqwONm4TE\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"ie6plcFQ330\",\"title\":\"Warpaint - Disco//Very - Keep It Healthy (Official Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ie6plcFQ330\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1BqwONm4TE\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.warpaintwarpaint.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/worldwartour\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/warpaintwarpaint\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/_warpaint\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"_warpaint\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1667743,\"name\":\"Goldensuns\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"There is an unspoken connection that exists between brothers. When this bond manifests during the creative process, it could be the best evidence the world currently has to the existence of telepathy. Case in point, the Los Angeles trio of Goldensuns, which consists of Wes, Jantzen and Chase Meier. On the band's upcoming self-titled EP, that unspoken fraternal synergy has resulted in something ambitious and beautifully cohesive that will most certainly elevate the band to a much larger platform upon its release this spring. \\r\\n\\r\\nGoldensuns was founded in the Meier's hometown of Salt Lake City in 2013. However, it's hard to justify the term 'founded' in this instance, as the three have been playing music together their entire lives. Still, despite their decade-long history of collaborating in other bands, this current Goldensuns incarnation is the first time that Wes, Jantzen and Chase ever comprised the full lineup for a project. As one listen through the EP will tell you, this has resulted in a scenario where those unspoken bonds were able to create some of the most innovative, self-exploring tracks of the band's career.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother major contributor to the direction of this EP was a move to Los Angeles in November of 2014. The greater possibilities that LA had to offer and the new friendships with other like-minded musicians played a huge role in helping Goldensuns really hone in on their vision for the project. When it came to the actual recording of the EP, the band felt the sound they were looking for would be best captured in the studio they had built at their home in Salt Lake City. The original plan was to be back in SLC for a week, but riding the synergistic flow that they were experiencing and allowing for a meticulous attention to detail ended up keeping the Meiers at their parents house for over a month while they perfected the sounds that would end up on the EP. During this time all three brothers would switch back and forth in terms of instrumentation, seek out the smallest adjustments to get the sounds perfect, and surprisingly fight very little over direction. The lack of arguments is even more surprising when you take into consideration how the band spared no detail or effort in making sure each track on the EP sounded exactly as they wanted it to turn out. As Jantzen put it, the band \\\"really took more care on this one knowing it would be their first release in 4 years\\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Meiers self-produced this EP and Jantzen handled the mixing and mastering duties, so it comes as no surprise that there is much more of the Meier's personality than you see in anything they've recorded previously. The result is something much more mature and, in a lot of ways, completely different from anything that any of the brothers have written before. It's almost a totally different genre than the alternative rock that they had been involved with traditionally. As the band puts it \\\"Most of the songs paint a very nighttime/dark reddish romantic feel. Sort of a nighttime drive in a city or maybe a sensual candle lit club\\\".  Overall, this EP is a much more honest interpretation of the music the guys are into and the way they want to progress creatively.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far the band has released two singles from the current EP, and the buzz around the band is already growing quickly. \\\"I Feel This Place\\\" premiered on IndieShuffle.com, where it quickly rose to number 1 on their \\\"Most Popular\\\" chart and subsequently ended up charting on Hype Machine as well. All Things Go called it \\\"a sun-soaked journey through pop-psychedelia\\\" and Buzzbands LA adds \\\"the self-produced track is swathed in hazy reverb, evoking the languid pleasures of \\\"this place\\\". The band followed up with the premiere of \\\"Give It Up\\\" on Nerdist, who said the track \\\"showcases their acumen for smart songwriting. Jabs of guitar wash in and out like the tide, simple percussion and bass provide enough room for the vocal hooks that are the heart of this song\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, this EP is overflowing with the great strides the band has made as songwriters, while also pointing towards the endless creative potential they hold. As more and more people realize how special of an act Goldensuns is, make no mistake that this self-titled EP will be a cornerstone of their discography and a pivotal moment in what will be a long and successful creative journey for the band.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":639},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":639},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/03-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"mkmyEoqnSio\",\"title\":\"I'm So Confused - Goldensuns (HQ) | Viral Music\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mkmyEoqnSio\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"MhMyrTEGX28\",\"title\":\"Goldensuns - I Feel This Place\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MhMyrTEGX28\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mkmyEoqnSio\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/goldensunsmusic/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/goldensunsmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"goldensunsmusic\"},{\"id\":1668677,\"name\":\"Vs Colour\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"VS Colour (Echo Park, LA) fuse different styles ranging from Hip Hop to Rock bottom.
