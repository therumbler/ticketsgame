With roots that bury themselves deep in the urgency of rock and a sound that's dappled with a carefree indie aesthetic, The Hunna want you to take a leaf out of their book, let go of your inhibitions and be young, be free, and be whoever the hell you want to be.\\n\\nMaking their debut in October of 2015 with their first single, \\\"Bonfire,\\\" the UK four\u00adpiece have already carved out handful of songs with a sonic bombast that has garnered millions of Spotify streams, 5+ million video\\nviews and praise by the likes of Zane Lowe, Annie Mac and Huw Stephens. The band sold out 3 nights at London's Boston Music Rooms and by the time their second single, 'We Could Be' was unleashed, The Hunna's music was making waves in the iTunes and Spotify charts on a global scale.\\n\\nThe Hunna are set to be the first band on your playlist, the one you listen to when you're driving around with the top down. Bleeding of a wistful nostalgia and teamed with an unremitting lust for life that is as infectious as it is relentless, The Hunna's unabashed sound has seen them play in front of sold out rooms across Europe on a headlining tour and will bring them to the States in Spring of 2016.\\n\\nThe Hunna began to take shape when Ryan (Vocals/Guitar), Dan (Lead Guitar) and Jermaine (Bass) met in college. After a couple of line\u00adup changes, Jack arrived on drums and everything fell into place. A sucker for a good chorus, the boys like to work from the outside in when it comes to writing. \\\"There are so many different processes to what we do, but often we'll start with a chorus, and then we'll funnel in from there,\\\" the band have noted about their writing and recording process. Working with esteemed producers Tim Larcombe (Halsey, Lana Del Rey) and Duncan Mills, the band are set to arrive with new single, \\\"You and Me (Hunna Tree),\\\" an anthemic call to arms for The Hunna army and a middle finger to those who just don't want to enlist. \\\"It's about us as a band \u00ad taking the negative things that people have said and sort of turning it around, \\\" muses Ryan. \\\"It's about the fans as well, it's for the Hunna family\u00ad the people who have been there from the very beginning,\\\" he adds.\\n\\nFrom the get go and in true Hunna fashion, the new track starts at 100%. Kicking off with a tenacious riff and accompanied by a soaring melody \u00ad you better turn \\\"You and Me (Hunna Tree)\\\" all the way up to 11, otherwise you're gonna get left behind.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/thehunnaband\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/thehunnaband/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/thehunnaband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"thehunnaband\"},{\"id\":1708413,\"name\":\"Night Riots\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"NIGHT RIOTS is setting the alternative underworld ablaze as swift and smartly as their brooding, melody rich and timeless songs have already endeared them to critics. The Southern California based band has a unique melodic sensibility -- delivering transcendent pop music that is both modern and timeless; as well as both sinister and romantic, with the downbeat flare of new wave, '80s movie soundtracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrontman Travis Hawley spent five years in England before moving to a small coastal town with only one traffic light, where he met guitarists Nick Fotinakes and Matt DePauw, bassist Mikel Van Kranenburg and drummer Rico Rodriguez. Now heralded by Rolling Stone as one of the \\\"Top 16 Unsigned Bands in North America,\\\" Night Riots are currently on tour with Young Rising Sons and have shared the stage with a diverse group of bands including Cage The Elephant, Walk The Moon, Meg Myers, OK Go, The Mowgli's, Wild Cub, Driver Friendly, Youngblood Hawke, The Front Bottoms, Angels & Airwaves and many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the tremendous success of their debut EP, 'Young Lore,' and praise from the likes of Billboard, Earmilk, KCRW, MTV, FUSE, Huffington Post, KROQ, All Things Go, NYLON, AV Club and Filter, Night Riots show no signs of slowing down. Signed to Sumerian Records, Night Riots recently released 'Howl,' produced by Eric Palmquist (Bad Suns, Trash Talk, Waaves, Mars Volta). \\\"Contagious,\\\" the EP's lead single, climbed the radio charts -- skyrocketing to #1 on SiriusXM's Alt Nation Alt 18 Countdown, and breaking into the Top 50 at Alt Radio.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.nightriots.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/pk\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/nightriots\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/nightriots\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"nightriots\"},{\"id\":1708415,\"name\":\"The Shelters\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"For a moment there, Los Angeles based band The Shelters seemed like 21st century rock 'n roll's best kept secret. But word got out. It started in the clubs. And everyone who saw them thought maybe he or she had gotten there first. By now, however, it's clear that they'll all have to share.\\n\\nThe Shelters have their self-titled debut LP coming June 10th on Warner Bros. Records. Just like the EP they released last October as an album preview, their full-length is a blast of Southern Californian rock and roll from a four-piece like they used to make them, when the factory was still up and running. Co-produced by Tom Petty, this album comes at you from behind, nothing you were expecting.\\n\\nThe Shelters had just banded together when Petty heard them and got a gut feeling about what they could be.  He gave the Shelters the keys to his home studio and showed them a few things. Though mostly he left them alone, Petty had enough sense to leave the gear powered up.  Maybe they were determined to show him he hadn't made a mistake. Maybe they just liked the way those old tube amps sounded. They seized the moment and got to work, insistent on becoming a band. A real band.\\n\\nOne listen to their single \\\"Rebel Heart,\\\" or any one of the other eleven songs on their debut, and you'll know they pulled it off. Led by the songs, harmonies and twin-guitar sound of Chase Simpson and Josh Jove, and powered by drummer Sebastian Harris's groove obsession, the band has put together a collection of recordings that have an immediacy, an emotion, and a musical intelligence that suggests these boys are beyond their years.\\n\\nPeople are going to reference some of the great rock and roll bands of yesterday and today. But this is no tribute show. The sounds they've made seem to have been dragged from the vaults and forced to fit the present. It's all a beautiful reminder that rock and roll may have slipped out of view for minute, but it's still out there, alive in the hands of the ones who need it the most.\\n\\nThe Shelters, now including Jacob Pillot on bass, have toured recently with the likes of Gary Clark Jr., The Kooks, The Wild Feathers, BRONCHO, Atlas Genius, The Struts and more, plus made major festival appearances across the country. They will tour with Mudcrutch in May and June of 2016.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thesheltersmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/TheShelters\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/TheShelters\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"TheShelters\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1315359?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
