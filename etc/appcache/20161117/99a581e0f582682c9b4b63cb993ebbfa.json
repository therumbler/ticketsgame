Band\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"When Josh Abbott Band recorded \u201cGhosts\u201d for its fourth album, Front Row Seat, Abbott expected to redo the vocals. The final chorus had some technical imperfections, and he figured he could improve on the performance once his heart settled down. Producer Dwight Baker, one-half of the Austinbased duo The Wind and The Wave, wouldn\u2019t let Abbott retouch it.\\r\\n\u201cI was actually crying my eyes out during that last chorus, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s a couple of notes in the beginning of that section that don\u2019t really explode like normal,\u201d Abbott says. \u201cDwight was like, \u2018We\u2019re keeping that. That\u2019s real.\u2019\u201d\\r\\nReal is the operative word for Front Row Seat, a 16-track song cycle that represents the most ambitious and emotionally challenging project yet for JAB, a highly melodic six-piece ensemble that\u2019s managed to keep a foot in both the Texas music scene and the national country world. The band won four\\r\\ntimes during the inaugural Texas Regional Radio Awards behind an upbeat brand of country that still leans on classic instrumentation \u2013 particularly banjo and fiddle \u2013 to effect a raucous, roof-raising attitude.\\r\\nThe band has lobbed three singles onto the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart \u2013 including \u201cOh, Tonight,\u201d the first charted track to feature Grammy-winning Kacey Musgraves \u2013 and nabbed a Top 10 album with the 2012 release Small Town Family Dreams and reached No. 12 with the 2014 EP Tuesday\\r\\nNight. But Front Row Seat steps beyond the band\u2019s honky-tonk inclinations for a more personal journey as the album traverses the emotional course of Abbott\u2019s first marriage and subsequent divorce. It was not his original intention to depict his private life in a public way, but as he wrote the songs for Front Row\\r\\nSeat, beginning before the split actually occurred, he naturally mined his emotional life for a set of songs that were profoundly honest and revealing. It was only as they began recording the material at Baker\u2019s Matchbox Studios outside of Austin, that they realized they had the germ of a tangible plot.\\r\\n\u201cWe started looking at the music we\u2019d done and had a whole bunch of other songs that we really loved and we were like, \u2018Man, we could put this together and make a really neat story out of it,\u201d fiddler Preston Wait recalls. \u201cEspecially with the song \u2018Front Row Seat,\u2019 we basically just made it kind of like you\u2019re watching a movie and it\u2019s your front row seat to this life.\u201d\\r\\nOwing to that silver-screen character, JAB employed screenwriting technique by assembling the project with the five elements of plot structure: the exposition, or beginning; an inciting incident; the climax; a falling action (in this case, a breakup); and the resolution. The story begins with \u201cWhile I\u2019m Young,\u201d in which a college-aged Abbott lives a typically\\r\\ncarefree existence, spending much of his discretionary income in bars and living for the moment, an ideal\\r\\nthat\u2019s captured authoritatively in the anthemic \u201cLive It While You Got It.\u201d As the album progresses, he meets a woman who commands his attention for more than one evening, finding himself by track 7, \u201cCrazy Things,\u201d mulling what it is that would make a woman who\u2019s dang-near perfect fall for someone so flawed.\\r\\nBy the time the album concludes, his once-ideal relationship has turned sour, and the two are no longer one. The fracture becomes apparent through the resignation of \u201cBorn To Break Your Heart,\u201d and he discovers in \u201cGhosts\u201d that all the memories that once lived with such passion and revelry continue to\\r\\nhaunt his memory, taunting him with whispers of a past he can never reclaim. As Front Row Seat closes with \u201cAnonymity,\u201d Abbott sings a spare dirge with acoustic guitar and fiddle, fantasizing that he could return to the start of the relationship and live it out right. \u201cWhen you\u2019re moving on from somebody, even once you\u2019ve accepted it, you just feel alone,\u201d Abbott observes. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason the acoustic track ends the album.\u201d\\r\\nEven though Front Row Seat represents an ode to a failed relationship, it also marks what Abbott expects to be the beginning of a new phase for JAB. One of Texas\u2019 best party bands, the group evolved heavily in the process of making the album. The players fully committed to a darker sound and gave even more prominence to Wait\u2019s fiddle and Austin Davis\u2019 banjo, highlighting the trad-country elements in the lineup while still infusing the influence of multiple genres in its sonic drama.\\r\\n\u201cWhen you get to the end of this album, you see a band that grew up before your eyes \u2013 like literally front to back, a band that sonically changed,\u201d Abbott says. \u201cYou never want to make the same album multiple times, and you never want to sound the same your entire career. You know, you look at The Beatles and you look at all these other great bands, they tweaked their sound over time, and I think you\u2019re gonna start to see us do that a little bit more.\u201d\\r\\nWhile JAB is truly a group, the name is centered on Abbott \u2013 the lead singer, primary songwriter and band namesake \u2013 with good reason. He is a determined force of nature, and his ability to lead \u2013 to, in essence, turn something small into something much bigger \u2013 has been a hallmark of the band since its inception.\\r\\nThat start came in the mid-2000s when Abbott and frat brother Davis showed up for a few informal gigs at the Blue Light Live in Lubbock, Texas. \u201cWe played two open-mic nights, and we had two songs, no band. Just him and me,\u201d Davis\\r\\nrecalls. \u201cI walk in the back, and Josh is talking to the owner and the manager about doing a live record there. And I\u2019m thinking, \u2018We don\u2019t even have a band.\u2019 His thing was, \u2018We\u2019ll get to that later.\u2019 He\u2019s always thought that way. I\u2019ve played in other bands but never saw anybody else with that kind of confidence.\u201d\\r\\nWait and drummer Edward Villanueva showed up a year and a half later, and in short time, JAB\u2019s first single \u2013 \u201cTaste,\u201d self-released on Pretty Damn Tough Records \u2013 found a home on Texas radio stations. Bass player James Hertless and lead guitarist Caleb Keeter came on board circa 2010, and the lineup has stabilized for the past five years.\\r\\n\u201cAny movie you see about a band, it\u2019s like five or six kids that are best friends,\u201d Wait says.\\r\\n\u201cGrowing up, that\u2019s kind of what you think it\u2019s gonna be like. I found that in this group.\u201d\\r\\nThe friendship is built on constant touring. Texas alone keeps the band steadily employed, but Abbott and crew have built a wider concert base that includes such iconic venues as Nashville\u2019s Exit/In, Chicago\u2019s Joe\u2019s Bar, Washington D.C.\u2019s 9:30 Club, Denver\u2019s Grizzly Rose and Los Angeles\u2019 Troubadour. The audience has grown in part because of the singability and relatability of the Abbott Band\u2019s material, which has always held something of an everyman appeal.\\r\\nAs personal as Front Row Seat is, the album has a ring of familiarity. Nearly everyone has messed up a relationship or had their heart broken. It\u2019s practically a rite of passage, and Abbott\u2019s willingness to tear down the walls and bare his heart lifts the project to a new level of connection with the band\u2019s growing audience.\\r\\n\u201cI know there\u2019s going to be a natural reflection on me and how the album mirrors my life,\u201d Abbott concedes. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to think that this is really a story that is so common that everyone relates to it and that it\u2019s not just about me. Hopefully people can listen to it and feel like it\u2019s about them.\u201d\\r\\nIt\u2019s about the band, too. Villanueva used a bigger drum kit in recording Front Row Seat, laying a little more power underneath. And Wait and Davis take a more prominent role in the sound, heightening the country and bluegrass sides of the group without harming its modern texture.\\r\\n\u201cWhen we come up with parts, it\u2019s difficult because it\u2019s not standard bluegrass, like Flatt & Scruggs,\u201d says Davis. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do something different. It pushes you to try and make something new.\u201d\\r\\nThere\u2019s certainly plenty new in Front Row Seat for Josh Abbott Band. The ethereal lyrics in \u201cAutumn\u201d and \u201cAnonymity\u201d are a starting place as Abbott\u2019s songwriting challenges country\u2019s tendency toward literal interpretations and storylines. The band also works for the first time with Carly Pearce, who\\r\\nprovides a powerhouse female presence on \u201cWasn\u2019t That Drunk.\u201d Assembling the project as a concept album with a distinct storyline is another new approach for JAB. The tormented lead single, \u201cAmnesia\u201d \u2013 with its snarling guitar solo and artsy, unsettling intro \u2013 is yet another new technique.\\r\\nThose wrinkles in JAB\u2019s development demonstrate the band\u2019s willingness to explore new turf, tapping musical character that might have gone unexpressed in its earlier projects. But people don\u2019t build character during the easy times. It comes when they\u2019re tested by the hurts and pitfalls that accompany any\\r\\nsuccessfully lived life. Abbott, as the leader of the band, is emerging from one of his toughest tests to date. He and the band used an ultra-honest approach to the hard times to take the next step as it moves into its future.\\r\\n\u201cThe whole band embraced this project and really committed to not only make it sound incredible but sound different and better,\u201d Abbott says. \u201cIt\u2019s more mature than anything we\u2019ve done in the past.\u201d\\r\\nMore mature because it\u2019s so honest. And so real.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/84/83-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O51iTKLe8lM\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.joshabbottband.com/home.php\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/joshabbottband\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/joshabbottband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/joshabbottband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"joshabbottband\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.thecrocodile.com/event/1379353?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
