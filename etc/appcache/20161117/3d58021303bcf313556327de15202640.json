He\u2019s rock & roll incarnate\u2014Mick and Keith rolled into one impossibly cool, soul-howling, guitar rattlin\u2019 ball of genuine unapologetic grit and swagger. At least that\u2019s how it seems gazing up from the crowd at a packed DBT show.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo how did this modern-day rock hero feel about temporarily ditching his band and rolling back the volume for the unaccompanied acoustic performances that would become his debut solo record, The Fool on Every Corner?\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t do it normally, it\u2019s terrifying,\u201d Cooley admits. \u201cI try to relax, but I\u2019ll probably never be able to sit down in a chair on stage as easily as I sit down on a toilet behind a closed door. That\u2019s the goal\u2014somewhere in between,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cI set the bar high.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite his bad nerves and tongue-in-cheek penchant for self-deprecation, Cooley shines on this bare-bones live set, tossing aside his guitar pick and playing almost everything with his fingers. \u201cStrip it, strip it, strip it down,\u201d he says, alluding to the mantra that guided these performances. \u201cWhat\u2019s left is the song and nothing else.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what a set of songs Fool is, comprised mainly of re-imagined DBT classics like \u201cShut Up and Get on the Plane,\u201d \u201cMarry Me\u201d and \u201cWhere the Devil Don\u2019t Stay,\u201d as well as understated renditions of deep-cut Cooley ballads such as \u201cPulaski,\u201d \u201cEyes Like Glue\u201d and the weary yet ominous \u201cLoaded Gun in the Closet.\u201d This intimate new record offers fans a peek behind the curtain at what these songs might have sounded like in their most nascent state. All of them save for opener \u201c3 Dimes Down,\u201d Cooley says, were originally written on acoustic. \u201cThe words just come out easier when you play an acoustic guitar,\u201d he explains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fool on Every Corner was recorded by longtime DBT producer David Barbe during a three-show run last March, beginning with a two-night stand at no-frills Atlanta rock club The Earl and closing at swank Athens, Ga., venue The Melting Point. \u201cThe second show at The Earl was a chaotic night,\u201d Cooley recalls. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the audience seated, for one thing. Of course, you can pack a lot more people in there if you have \u2019em standing, but for acoustic shows, I prefer to sit \u2019em down and calm \u2019em down if I can.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis proved an impossibility in the boisterous barroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018We\u2019re not gonna get anything outta tonight. The crowd is just too loud.\u2019\u201d As it turns out, almost everything that ended up on Fool came from that rowdy night. \u201cIt\u2019s that way every time I\u2019ve ever recorded live,\u201d Cooley says, shaking his head. \u201cThe night you think bombed or wasn\u2019t as good, inevitably, will be the one that comes across best on the recording.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nPeppered throughout this gem of a record are Cooley\u2019s charmingly candid asides, a few revealing admissions about the writing process, the songs and the characters who populate them, the odd banjo joke, a disarmingly sweet cover of Charlie Rich\u2019s \u201cBehind Closed Doors\u201d and the never-before-released original, \u201cDrinking Coke and Eating Ice.\u201d The latter\u2014an almost-whispered tragicomic reflection\u2014was included, Cooley says, because he wanted to offer something new for fans. Plus, it was something he\u2019d been wanting to get off his chest. Carved from a hodgepodge of ideas he\u2019d been scribbling down over a two-year period, the DBT guitarist sees the song as a metaphor for the last 25 years of American culture and where it\u2019s gone. \u201cThe girl in the beginning is America,\u201d he says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look as good as she used to. She\u2019s let herself go. For all the wrong reasons.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the weathered protagonist in \u201cDrinking Coke,\u201d the 46-year-old Cooley has also seen his share of hard-traveled miles, though the outcome for him has been decidedly more positive. After spending much of his young life scrapping in the rock & roll trenches, he\u2019s become one of the best songwriters of his generation, having amassed a catalog of songs that can go toe-to-toe with any of his contemporaries. Along the way, he and Drive-By Truckers have become an acclaimed, enduring lynchpin of American rock & roll. And now, with The Fool on Every Corner, Cooley begins the latest chapter in his impressive career, uncompromising as always, and more thankful than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky as hell,\u201d he says. \u201cNo doubt about it. I\u2019m not rich, I\u2019m probably not gonna be, and I\u2019m totally cool with that. But I\u2019m making my living, and I do what I want\u2014I do it my way. I\u2019ve got an awesome family, a bunch of great friends, loyal fans. And I think about that every day. It just would be immoral for me not to.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1123},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":351},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":234},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-og.jpg\",\"width\":1441,\"height\":1685},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":117},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":585},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":760},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/09/43-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.drivebytruckers.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/cooleymusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/drivebytruckers\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"drivebytruckers\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1371275?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
