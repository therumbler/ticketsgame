With a rapidly expanding international fanbase, the band has captivated audiences with their electric blend of technical, effects- heavy songwriting with post-hardcore passion and stage presence. Driven by rich lyricism and melodic, emotive vocals in the vein of Emarosa and The Getaway Plan, the band presents a complex and finely crafted mix of guitar and electronics, drawing from a broad range of influence including Thrice, The Receiving End of Sirens and Closure in Moscow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closing of 2011 saw the band sign to the respected record label Rise Records, with their highly anticipated debut album \u02bbGround Dweller\u02bcsubsequently announced to be released worldwide on March 13th.\\r\\n\\r\\nHLH traveled to the USA in 2010 and 2011 to record \u02bbGround Dweller\u02bc with Cameron Mizell of Chango Studios (Woe, Is Me, Sleeping With Sirens, Memphis May Fire). The subsequent single releases, 'This Ain't No Place For Animals', and 'Lion Skin (feat. Tyler Carter and Jonny Craig)' earned the band over 5,000 independent single sales via iTunes during 2011, and their most recent single \u02bbAntarctica\u02bc, released on YouTube through Rise Records, amassed almost 200,000 views in its first month. This, along with the band's self-produced acoustic versions of 'Lion Skin,' 'The Sower', and other tracks off \u02bbGround Dweller\u02bc, their YouTube channels have seen over a million views, growing daily. Boasting a dedicated and fast-growing international fanbase, built through years of personally managing their social networks and independent promotion and touring, Hands Like Houses released their hotly anticipated debut album \u02bbGround Dweller\u02bc on March 13th worldwide through Rise Records. Buoyed by exceptional online hype and pre-order numbers for a debut release, the record broke into the US Billboard Heatseekers and Top 200 charts at #2 and #140 respectively in its\u02bc first week, and is well on track to move over 10,000 copies in the US alone within 4 months of the release.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, the band has supported a number of notable acts from Australia and around the world, including The Getup Kids (USA), As Tall As Lions (USA), The Getaway Plan (AUS), Dream On Dreamer (AUS), Hopes Die Last (ITA) and Tonight Alive (AUS). Their 2011 touring schedule saw the band play 50+ shows across Australia and Europe, impressing audiences with a sound and stage presence beyond their standing. 2012 has already seen Hands Like Houses add to their list of local, national and international supports, beginning with Pushover Festival in Melbourne Australia in support of Parkway Drive, Tonight Alive, 360 and others, and continuing onto the USA on the Rise Records Freshman Tour with The Air I Breathe, My Ticket Home, and Palisades. In addition, the band performed on the entire 2012 Scream It Like You Mean It festival tour, performing in support of Attack, Attack, We Came As Romans and The Acacia Strain, and will be supporting Pierce The Veil\u02bcs Fall headlining national tour with Sleeping With Sirens.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":851,\"height\":315},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":851,\"height\":315},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":111},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":111},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":74},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":74},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-og.jpg\",\"width\":851,\"height\":315},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":37},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":37},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":185},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":185},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":241},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/04/17-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":241}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://handslikehouses.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/handslikehouses\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/HandsLikeHouses\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"HandsLikeHouses\"},{\"id\":746725,\"name\":\"Our Last NIght\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"By standard definition the word \\\"evolution\\\" means a process of change in a certain direction. In life, people, cities, nature, art and music among other things go through their own evolutionary cycles, constantly moving forward and continually changing. New Hampshire based melodic-metal outfit Our Last Night has experienced their own such growth over the past several years. Through experience, methodically honing their craft and long arduous touring, Our Last Night has emerged matured and seasoned with their self-defining sophomore album 'We Will All Evolve.'\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand their development you have to go back a few years. Our Last Night was conceived outside the conventional scene in the sleepy town of Hollis, New Hampshire on the outskirts of Boston in 2004. After a recording an EP later that year, the band cemented its current lineup in 2006 with brothers Matt Wentworth (guitar/vocals) and a then sixteen year old prodigious growler Trevor Wentworth (vocals), Colin Perry (guitar), Alex \\\"Woody\\\" Woodrow (bass) and Tim Molloy (drums). Individuality and shear skill led Epitaph Records owner and president Brett Gurewitz to sign the band in 2007 and release their debut full-length album, 'The Ghost Among Us,' in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2008, Our Last Night has built a core army of fans. Not through flashy persona, fame fueled online gossip or monotonous scene imagery, but through their music and touring alone. Letting the music speak for itself has helped the band transcend boundaries and created limitless room for growth. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur Last Night entered the studio in late 2009 with producer Andrew Wade (A Day To Remember, Versa Emerge) to record 'We Will All Evolve'. After a month long recording session and additional mixing by David Bendeth (Breaking Benjamin, Paramore, Set Your Goals) the album was completed and ready for release in May 2010. \\r\\n\\r\\nExploding with depth and maturity, 'We Will All Evolve' blends Trevor's harsh, aged-to-perfection growls perfectly with Matt's melodious, calming vocals over his and Colin's progressive, breakneck-metal driven guitars, Woody's heavy hitting bass and Tim's pummeling drums. Ripping through thirty-seven plus minutes of meticulously written melodic mayhem with tracks like the furious first single, \\\"Elephants,\\\" the indisputably catchy \\\"The Air I Breath,\\\" and the bouncy pop-metal hybrid \\\"Into the Future,\\\" Our Last Night break out of their cocoon riff by riff, chorus by chorus rising above the limits of a so called scene. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith plans to tour in support of the new album throughout 2010 including dates on the Vans Warped Tour, Our Last Night's evolution continues as the band feeds off of experience and the incessant need to create and grow.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":406},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":406},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":127},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":127},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":85},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":85},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-og.jpg\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":423},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":42},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":42},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":212},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":212},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":275},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/94/88/15-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":275}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.myspace.com/ourlastnight\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://myspace.com/ourlastnight\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/ourlastnightband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/olnband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"olnband\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1679919,\"name\":\"The Color Morale\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"CONSISTING OF GARRET RAPP (VOCALS), DEVIN KING (GUITAR), AARON SAUNDERS (GUITAR), STEVE CAREY (DRUMS) AND MIKE HONSON (BASS), THE COLOR MORALE STANDS WITH THEIR FANS.
