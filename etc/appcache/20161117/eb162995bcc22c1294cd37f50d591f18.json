It\u2019s a language she speaks fluently, something that became immediately apparent when she released her debut album, Secret Music, in January 2015. At the tender age of 8 Kress wrote her first song and never stopped writing, what she lacked was the confidence to play her music for an audience. It took a breast cancer diagnosis in 2011 to make Kress realize that her dream to share her music needed to be realized before it was too late. Things got interesting when Glenn Sawyer of The Spot Studios in Lakewood, CO took notice of the fledgling artist\u2019s demo online and invited her for a tour of his studio. It was a fortuitous meeting and Kress and Sawyer working along with fellow The Spot producer Rich Veltrop, spend the next several months making music with the result being the aptly named Secret Music. With the help of manager, Joel Rekiel, Kress has been working to expand her reach online and was planning a U.S. tour when she was diagnosed with breast cancer for a second time in September 2014. A much longer and difficult treatment plan left Kress unable to do much more than eat, sleep and make music. \u201cBeing in an emotionally primed state like I was made the music flow. I would just sit at the piano for hours and play. It was my meditation and my release.\u201d says Kress of the time she has dubbed her \u201cChemo Chrysalis.\u201d \u201cI was sick all winter and finished my treatments just as the spring came. I felt reborn with the season.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2015 Kress launched a remix contest via Soundcloud for her single Numb. The two month long contest yielded over 100 astounding remixes from which Kress chose 10 winners. Producers from the U.S., Scotland, Italy, Mexico and, Germany, among others can find their winning remix compiled on one of two savvily packaged remix albums. Kress adds a touch of whimsy in the cover art of the two compilations splitting her floating image between the two cases, which with everything from dubstep, and bollywood to accordion and string fields, Amy Kress\u2019s remix compilation has an exciting variety of takes on the same song.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom playing intimate performances at the Meadowlark and Denver Syntax Physic Opera to performing at the Larimer Lounge or The Walnut Room, it\u2019s the live interaction from fans that moves Amy Kress to perform at her peak. Deep down inside, she\u2019s still surprised that her songs can captivate people, yet many are turning their heads and giving attention to this mile high artist. The big-sounding chorus on \u201cNumb\u201d and the wide appeal of songs like \u201cThe Crush\u201d and \u201cSaturday\u201d are winning listeners over by leaps and bounds. Kress\u2019s acoustic performances of her new material have gained a lot of attention in the recent months and her song titled Silent Words won a place on the winners compilation for Colorado\u2019s COMBO\u2019s songwriting contest.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor her next effort, Kress had been re-tuning her overall sound and has presented her new music as both a solo act and as a three piece grouping of keys, cello and drums. Kress\u2019s adaptation of Iceland for the trio helped to create an intimate grouping for the private performance. Filmed by Jeramey Johnson, this visually stunning work was shot in Kress\u2019s own backyard. A full moon softly illuminates more than a dozen comfortable couches scattered about her yard. Kress wore a teal strapless evening gown that echoed the deep blue color lighting her huge branching tree. Glass jars filled with candles hung from it\u2019s light wrapped branches and provided the backdrop for the stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unique setting of the show can not be overstated and fans are waiting anxiously for a glimpse of what Kress is bringing to the table next. \\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Calgary, Canada, Kress became an Aramco Brat when her family moved to Saudi Arabia from the time she was 5 until the age of 12. She moved to the United States in 2001 during the unforgettable week of 9/11, and settled into Colorado, a state she loved so much she never left. Kress is a mother of two children and has a house full of rescue animals. She has a Great Dane and a terrier named Daisy and Molly respectively and two cats, General Rufus of the U.S.S. Samuel L. Jackson and Captain Nigel Shabbadoo, Destroyer of Worlds, all of whom she chronicles on an instagram page under daisyandmollydog.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently diagnosed with Stage IV cancer, Kress has pulled back on her music for the time being. While still actively writing Kress is making public performances more of an occasional thing. \u201cI like the idea of the secret house show\u201d says Kress. \u201cI loved that we put on an absolutely unique evening that no one expected. It was a really magical experience and it would be amazing to do more shows like that.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe certainly hope that Kress will host another such event in the near future.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-og.jpg\",\"width\":1600,\"height\":1600},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/75/19-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://amykressmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/AmyKressMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1760533,\"name\":\"Tana Victoria\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Tana Victoria is a singer, songwriter and indie-electronic artist from Golden, Colorado. \\r\\n\\r\\nDrawing melodic influence from artists like Florence + The Machine, Radiohead, Muse and Depeche Mode, Victoria\u2019s eclectic sound has a dark, emotive color, infused with her classical music training.
