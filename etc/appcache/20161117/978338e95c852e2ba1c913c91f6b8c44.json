and Sene\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"At a time when the idea of \\\"alternative R&B\\\" has become the genre-defying norm, when hip hop and EDM and house music and indie-rock have all started to sound mysteriously the same, the chilled-out, futuristic soul vibes of Brooklyn electro pop duo denitia and sene. make a perfect kind of sense. The group formed in 2011 after the two crossed paths at a Brooklyn art and music collective simply known as \\\"The Clubhouse.\\\" At the time, Sene (who cut his teeth in NYC and LA as a rapper) was looking for a vocalist to sing over some of his beats. Denitia, who had come to NYC less than a year earlier to make a name for herself as a singer/songwriter, was happy to oblige. As it turned out, the pairing of powerhouse vocalist Denitia and production whiz and beat-maker Sene turned out to be something of an effortless no-brainer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Our first collaborations had such an ease to them,\\\" recalls Denitia. \\\"It just seemed like an obvious thing to keep going. Then, after we put out our first EP the response was pretty immediate. Certain blogs and music sites started to mention us, but more importantly our friends were really into it, and that was kind of the most encouraging thing.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The ease that we have working together has carried over into all aspects of what we do,\\\" says Sene. \\\"There is often this big power struggle in New York\u2014especially coming from the world of hip hop\u2014but we've tried to just do our own thing and follow the opportunities that have come to us. We are very humble people, actually. We just try to focus on working and to make sure that we're having fun. Not getting too caught up in the business\u2014and the competitiveness\u2014of the music world has served us well. We've been pretty happy to do our own thing.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter releasing a debut EP in 2012 (Blah, Blah, Blah) and making a name for themselves as a formidable live act, two duo unleashed their first full-length, His and Hers, in early 2013. That record not only spawned a fair amount of press attention (Interview Magazine saying that the record \\\"\u2026feels like summer love: dreamy, loose, freewheeling\u2026\\\"), it also reached #11 on the iTunes R&B chart based on the strength of singles like \\\"Casanova\\\" and \\\"Lucy, Loosie.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe band followed His and Hers with a couple of singles before dropping the side fx EP in 2015. Tracing a progression from trip hop to R&B to pure electro-pop, it harnesses a vibe that wouldn't be out of place on an old Fugees or Massive Attack record. The EP's title track is an exercise in sublime minimalism, with warm synth sounds playing counterpoint to Denitia's sanguine vocals. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I know it sounds kind of like a clich\u00e9 response, but I don't really like to think about our music in terms of genre,\\\" explains Denitia. \\\"I know it's easy for people to think of what we do as pop music and I'm fine with that. Mostly I think that we've both been blessed with having an ear towards simply making good songs, and not necessarily gearing ourselves towards making any particular genre of music. Over the years I've been in almost every kind of band you can imagine, so I think I bring that experience with me to this project. I love every kind of music\u2014and I feel grateful that my voice, both literally and figuratively, is not coming from a totally defined place.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Honestly, I'm not concerned with the genre,\\\" says Sene, \\\"I think it's kind of funny that we get described in so many different ways. I've never been opposed to the idea of making pop music. Pop is short for popular. You can call it whatever you want, really.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a time when New York City is taking a lot of heat for being overly expensive, too clean, and no longer a place fit for harboring the hungry young starving artist, the continued success of a duo like denitia and sene. is particularly inspiring. For Sene, a native New Yorker, the city continues to be a constantly renewable kaleidoscope of influence and inspiration. For Denitia, a Texas native who, like so many before her, moved to the city to explore her creative ambitions, New York has been a crucial element not only in the development of her band, but on her development as a human being. The restless energy and the need to evolve that is so much a part of denitia and sene.'s music could only have been inspired by the very same city that brought the two musicians together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I love New York and I feel like it's the struggle of being here \u2014 and how hard it is to come here from wherever you might have grown up \u2014 that makes for such good art and music,\\\" says Denitia. \\\"I always think of New York like a rock tumbler \u2014 remember those things from when you were kid? You put a bunch of rocks inside and eventually it polishes them by rolling them around together? \u2014 this city is like that. You come here and live among millions of people, every day you get bumped around and turned around and eventually\u2014if you are lucky\u2014you emerge from that experience as something else, something shiny and new.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\ndenitia and sene.'s sophomore full-length album, love and noir., will be released November 18. A preview track from the new album, \\\"open wide.\\\", was recently featured on Refinery 29, following on the heels of their sultry summer single \\\"olive.\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIndividually, Denitia and Sene have been busy since their last release, his and hers., which hit Top 10 on the iTunes R&B chart. Denitia released the sprawling Air Light EP for her solo project ADESUWA earlier this year. Sene is in the cast of the Netflix television series Luke Cage and stars alongside Emma Roberts in Nerve in addition to a lead role in festival favorite White Girl. \\r\\n\\r\\n* * * \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Denitia Odigie has become one of NYC's most prized voices.\\\" \u2013 Okay Player\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Coital, iceberg-cold R&B\u2026\\\" \u2013 Rolling Stone\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Sometimes Denitia goes it alone, and sometimes Sene does.
