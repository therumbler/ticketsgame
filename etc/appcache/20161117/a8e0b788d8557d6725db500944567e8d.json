Jones\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"DEMUN JONES has always had a way of keeping it real when it comes to the music he has written, recorded and performed throughout his career, but, that said, JONES COUNTY might well be the most genuine collection of songs that represents who the Georgia native is and certainly illustrates the place where he\u2019s lived his entire life. Asked how the songs for his forthcoming solo project came about, Demun said, \u201cI went out in my front yard and imagined what are they doing? What are they thinking? What are they going to do? What do I see?\u201d Life in Jones County, which is just north of Macon, is southern and some, including the Jones family, will say they\u2019re rednecks. They drive trucks. They fish and hunt. They like keeping things simple\u2014sort of a what-you-see is what-you-get type of place. All the same, Jones County is what you hear and Demun is hoping people who are from there will respect and love his latest collection of 12 songs, while people who aren\u2019t from around those parts will be \u201ccaptivated by it and want to listen to it.\u201d Demun \u2013 a nickname he earned at a young age because he was aggressive and energetic \u2013 was 10 years old when he was transfixed by the immergence of N.W.A. and how they represented their own hometown. He\u2019s never forgotten how that seminal album affected a southern boy down in Georgia. He\u2019s always wanted to do the same for Jones County. \u201cI\u2019ve had inspirations that cover the whole gamut of genres,\u201d Demun said. His musical influences are not all southern or country. His oldest brother Chris introduced him to Led Zeppelin along with AC-DC and Black Sabbath, while his mother Cheryl introduced him to the likes of Marvin Gaye and other Motown acts, including James Brown and Michael Jackson. A ranch owned by Otis Redding is right down the road from where Jones grew up the son of a lifelong brick mason worker. He was the third of six children, who spent their hot summer days playing football in the front yard and frog hunting in a creek behind a hayfield that surrounded their modest home. His uncles introduced him to the southern rock soundscape of The Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Back then Demun wasn\u2019t a singer, but he knew at a young age he wanted to do something musical. He started listening to hip hop and rap and was intrigued by breakdancing. That\u2019s when he heard N.W.A. That album was about Compton, for Compton and the whole world took notice. It was a musical documentary \u2013 sort of a bird\u2019s eye view of life \u2013 that Demun wanted to portray in his own autobiographical song selection for Jones County. \u201cIt gave me some hope that I could make my own music,\u201d said Demun, who wrote his first song when he was 15. \u201cIt took a long time for me to realize I could make country music without singing the whole time and still be for the country person.\u201d And that is exactly what Demun, whose vocal delivery is as intense as it is distinct, set out to accomplish with Jones County. The challenge was infusing his country inspired lyrics with hip hop grooves. Demun said the creative process often began with a drum beat or chord progression on the guitar, while \u2013 thematically speaking \u2013 each story was influenced by characters (friends, family and actual folks from the heart of Georgia) and the very experiences Demun had come across throughout his life growing up and living in Jones County, Georgia. \u201cI tried to focus on music that was for people I grew up around,\u201d he said. No song is more familiar to him on Jones County than I\u2019m a Man, which he co-wrote with the guys from I4NI and Jon Conner. It\u2019s about his father Ricky, 61, who has been laying bricks past 49 years. It\u2019s about hard work, ethics and honesty, but, more importantly, Demun said, \u201cHe\u2019s always wanted me to sing on a song and this is one of the first, you know what I\u2019m saying, and it\u2019s about him.\u201d Demun added, \u201cI had to do to it once I heard the demo and I did what I had to do to pull it off.\u201d He\u2019s already filmed a video for Tannerite \u2013 the lone fictional tale of what happens when some southern boys are playing with explosives and what occurs when they come across a Sasquatch \u2013 and Boondocks is another tune that\u2019s all-too-familiar to Jones and a legion of rednecks that Jones County speaks to. It\u2019s an actual place in Georgia, where Demun shot The Muddy Muddy video, in a 1,000-acre field in front of 5,000 people. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really understood who I was speaking to with my direction,\u201d said Demun, who went there to film a video and was so affect by the experience he wrote an entire song about it. It had rained all week leading up to the Fourth of July video shoot, but the weather was nice by show time and, of course, muddy. \u201cIt was redneck heaven,\u201d Demun proclaimed. For Demun, Jones County is a great place to live and Jones County the album finally illustrates his evolution as a person \u2013 he\u2019s married and the father of two girls, 3 and 4 \u2013 and as an artist. It\u2019s all part of the freedom of expression that comes with writing songs for a solo project. \u201cIt came natural once the process started,\u201d Demun concluded. \u201cJones County was the easiest album and the easiest songs I\u2019ve written in my life.\u201d These songs might have come naturally to him, but Demun has been playing music for a long time \u2013 including a 10-year stint as a member of Rehab \u2013 and it\u2019s taken all that time for him to get to a point where he can write songs that represent his life as it is today. He extensively toured with Rehab band mate Danny Boone and co-wrote a lot of the Rehab material, including the critically acclaimed songs for Welcome Home. He also co-wrote Welcome 2 Jawga with the Jawga Boyz, who made an appearance on Jones County as do Charlie Farley, Bubba Sparxx and Locash Cowboys. Demun\u2019s first mainstream credit as a songwriter came on title track of Colt Ford\u2019s popular Ride Through the Country, which also featured John Michael Montgomery.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":759},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":237},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":158},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-og.png\",\"width\":991,\"height\":784},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":79},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":396},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atxl1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atxxl.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":514},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/73/62-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"akfB8_D_4Sk\",\"title\":\"Demun Jones - Bronco (feat.
