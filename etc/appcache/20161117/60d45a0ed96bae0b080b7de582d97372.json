As follow up to his 2014 debut In the Shower, Homeshake released his sophomore effort Midnight Snack last fall with Sinderlyn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMidnight Snack was recorded this past winter with Jackson MacIntosh at the Drones club in Montreal. Musically this time around Sagar trades in his guitar for synthesizers and a drum machine, developing vocal arrangements from loops he created for solo set. He pulled influence from house pioneers like Chip E and Mr. Fingers as well as Japanese pop starlets like Chiemi Manabe, slowing down the tempo with his own homemade drowsiness. The resulting collection is an eclectic tangle of personal anecdotes steeped in an everlasting reverence of D'Angelo and R Kelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the record was written following Sagar's dizzying time on the road as touring guitarist with Mac Demarco, reflecting on the loneliness the plagued him towards the end of his run and the longing for life back home in Montreal. Sagar left the band to focus on his own music and to rebuild the infrastructure of his life. While many of the new tracks meander through anxiety and melancholy it is also a witness to a return to safety. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a reoccurring theme for Sagar of pulling inward throughout the record. He casts a wide net and fills it with a multitude of musical influences and international tour dates then slows it down a few tempos and builds something humble around it. Throughout the record he peppers in a deep appreciation for the meals prepared by his girlfriend Salina and the simple pleasure of a midnight snack before curling up in bed next to the person you love.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":700,\"height\":466},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":700,\"height\":466},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-og.jpg\",\"width\":700,\"height\":466},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/41/85-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.homeshake.bandcamp.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/homeshake\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1730783,\"name\":\"Elsa\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"From Toronto Ontario, Elsa began as a solo experiment of songwriter/vocalist/guitarist Jonathan Rogers. In the summer of 2011, during a visit to his mother's house, Rogers would record 4 demos that he would later release as a limited cassette run on toronto label \\\"Not Unlike\\\" . He quickly developed a potent aesthetic from his vast musical obsessions, focusing on clean 80's new wave guitar sounds on top of 90's chord progressions and song structure. The result was both intricate and delicate, a unique and shimmering brand of dream pop. The sound worked and soon the release began to resonate amongst the toronto independent music community. Rogers began to receive offers for shows he could not preform by himself. He enlisted the help of the best musicians he knew, his childhood friends Mathew Goldman (Guitar), Jesse Mirsky (Bass) and Angie Wong (Drums). Together the quartet arranged and recorded 12 songs, 4 of which would wind up being released as a 12\\\" vinyl by Toronto label One Big Silence, run by Mike Haliechuck (Fucked Up). Their first proper release garnered praise from such taste making blogs as Pitchfork, Noisey and Toronto staple Exclaim. The release sold quickly as the band developed their live show, playing across Canada and into the US, sharing the stage with Mac Demarco, Crystal Stilts, Lee Ranaldo (sonic youth), Yuck, Alvvays and many more. \\n\\nThe band has readied their next release for 2015, a new 5 song EP via One Big Silence entitled \\\"Never Come Down,\\\" A huge step forward in terms of the band's sound and songwriting. The band has also written a full length they plan to record and release within the year as well.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://elsa.bandcamp.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/iheartelsa\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1040859,\"name\":\"Jaunt\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/thebandjaunt\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1336091?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
