Most of us are children of immigrants, so it\u2019s perhaps natural that the songs we create celebrate America in this way.\u201d So says Louie Perez, the \u201cpoet laureate\u201d and primary wordsmith of Los Lobos, when describing the songs on the band\u2019s new album, Gates of Gold. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe stories on Gates of Gold are snapshots of experiences that Perez and his band mates have had, based on where they are emotionally and how they respond to evolving life circumstances. \u201cWe live out loud most of the time and share our life this way, but then there are more intrinsic things that happen, and our songs are part of the way we react to them.  We sit down and basically tell people what has happened. We certainly didn\u2019t start this project with aspirations to create the musical equivalent to great American literary works.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter celebrating their 40th anniversary with the cleverly titled 2013 live album Disconnected In New York City, the hard working, constantly touring band \u2013 David Hidalgo, Louie Perez, Cesar Rosas, Conrad Lozano and Steve Berlin \u2013 leaps headfirst into their fifth decade with an invitation to join them as they open fresh and exciting new Gates of Gold, their first full length studio album since 2010\u2019s Tin Can Trust (a Grammy nominee for Best Americana Album) and second with Savoy/429 Records. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe dynamic songwriting, deeply poetic lyrics, thoughtful romantic and spiritual themes and eclectic blend of styles on the 11 track collection has resulted in an American saga in the rich literary tradition of legendary authors John Steinbeck and William Faulkner.  Yet true to form, these typically humble musical wolves started in on the project without any grand vision or musical roadmap. Over 30 years after Los Lobos\u2019 major label breakthrough How Will The Wolf Survive? - their 1984 album that ranks #30 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s \u2013 their main challenge when they get off the road and head back into the studio is, as Berlin says, \u201ctrying not to do stuff we\u2019ve already done. To a certain extent, we are always drawing from the same multi-faceted paint box, and we sound like what we sound like. We\u2019re proud of what we feel is an honest body of work. We just want to keep finding new ways to say things.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the band\u2019s early recording days - those years just before and after \u201cLa Bamba,\u201d their worldwide crossover hit from the 1987 film which reached #1 on the U.S. and UK singles chart - they prepared for album recording sessions with top producers like T-Bone Burnett   with pre-production that included multiple rehearsals and \u201coutlining\u201d what the project was going to be. The more spontaneous approach to writing and recording that they took on their 1992 Mitchell Froom co-produced set Kiko still exists today; Rosas says, \u201cWhen I listen to our catalog, doing things more spontaneously in the studio has led to some of our best work.\u201d Unlike many bands that write, gather and catalog material between studio releases, Los Lobos prefers to create their magic on the fly when they decide it\u2019s time to record. Perez says, \u201cWe never come in with a cache of 20 songs. Our thing is to write as we\u2019re recording. It\u2019s like starting with a blank canvass every time.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey to Gates of Gold began with Hidalgo bringing in a batch of ideas, outlines and chord progressions with no lyrics. As he and Perez began fleshing things out, developing grooves, melodies and lyrical themes, Hidalgo, his son, drummer David, Jr. and bassist Lozano began tracking those tunes. The collection opens with the reflective, mid-tempo  rocker \u201cMade To Break Your Heart,\u201d featuring female vocalist Syd Straw, whose vibe was partially inspired by Hidalgo\u2019s love for Manassas, the early 70s blues-country-rock band created by Stephen Stills. The moody, atmospheric rocker \u201cWhen We Were Free,\u201d whose lyrics of what Berlin calls \u201cbeautiful melancholy memories\u201d are underscored with the increasing drama of booming drums and distorted electric guitars. Filled with hypnotic sound effects and cool vocal and guitar distortion (created via an eight track analog Cascam cassette recorder!), the soulful, reflective \u201cThere I Go\u201d touches on the universal search for what Perez calls \u201csomething meaningful, though we\u2019re not always sure what it is.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther Hidalgo/Perez collaborations include \u201cToo Small Heart,\u201d a raw and raucous nod to both Los Lobos garage band roots and the wild abandon of Jimi Hendrix; the easy grooving folk-rocker \u201cSong of the Sun,\u201d which taps into the elements of life (water, fire, earth) and creation myths while touching on the way we choose to live in the present; the slow burning blues/rocker \u201cMagdalena,\u201d inspired by the Biblical Mary Magdalene and visions of flowing robes; and the folk-influenced, image rich rocker title track \u201cGates of Gold,\u201d whose lyrical abstractions allow for multiple earthly and spiritual interpretations.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerez says, \u201cWhen I first started listening to the original demo Dave had, the music spoke to me of rural America. The impression the lyrics give could refer to the afterlife, i.e. the \u201cpearly gates,\u201d but I also was thinking about the immigrant experience, the promise of a new life as one travels across borders, all the thoughts a person making that daring move might have connected to the dream of what America is. Our parents all wondered what lay beyond those gates. On a personal level, it\u2019s a reflection of where my band mates and I are in our lives. We\u2019re all over 60 now and looking towards the horizon at our own mortality. We think often about what we\u2019ve contributed and what\u2019s left. I don\u2019t know who the protagonist of the song is, but he\u2019s looking at those gates from a distance because what lies beyond is a mystery.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Hidalgo and Perez began collaborating on their songs, Rosas, as per his trademark \u201clone wolf\u201d songwriting approach, took his basic tracks to his home studio to complete the handful of tunes that flesh out the set. The singer, guitarist and mandolin player\u2019s pieces include the raucous and bluesy, garage band fired jam \u201cMis-Treater Boogie Blues,\u201d the swampy folk-rock blues lament \u201cI Believed You So\u201d and the swaying, sensual Latin Cumbia-styled \u201cPoquito Para Aqui.\u201d The sole cover on Gates of Gold is the other Spanish language tune, \u201cLa Tumba,\u201d an accordion laced folk piece connected to the Mexican Norteno tradition (related to polka and corrodes) whose theme, says Perez, is very dark, \u201cabout following your lover to the tomb.\u201d It\u2019s very familiar to fans as a frequent staple of Los Lobos\u2019 live performances.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in 2003, when Los Lobos was celebrating the 30th Anniversary of their humble beginnings as a garage band in East L.A., Rolling Stone summed up their distinctive, diverse, freewheeling fusion of rock, blues, soul and Mexican folk music: \u201cThis is what happens when five guys create a magical sound, then stick together\u2026to see how far it can take them.\u201d  Originally called Los Lobos del Este (de Los Angeles), a play on a popular norteno band called Los Lobos del Norte, the group originally came together from three separate units. Lead vocalist/guitarist Hidalgo, whose arsenal includes accordion, percussion, bass, keyboards, melodic, drums, violin and banjo, met Perez at Garfield High in East LA and started a garage band. Rosas, who had his own group, and Lozano launched a power trio. \u201cBut we all hung out because we were friends and making music was just the natural progression of things,\u201d says Perez, the band\u2019s drummer. \u201cLike if you hang around a barbershop long enough, you\u2019re going to get a haircut.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBerlin is Los Lobos\u2019 saxophonist, flutist and harmonica player who met the band while still with seminal L.A. rockers The Blasters. He joined the group after performing on and co-producing (with T-Bone Burnett) their breakthrough 1983 EP \u2026And A Time To Dance. Los Lobos were already East L.A. neighborhood legends, Sunset Strip regulars and a Grammy winning band (Best Mexican American/Tejano Music Performance) by the time they recorded How Will the Wolf Survive? Although the album\u2019s name and title song were inspired by a National Geographic article about real life wolves in the wild, the band saw obvious parallels with their struggle to gain mainstream rock success while maintaining their Mexican roots.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerez, once called their powerhouse mix of rock, Tex-Mex, country, folk, R&B, blues and traditional Spanish and Mexican music \u201cthe soundtrack of the barrio.\u201d Three decades, two more Grammys, the global success of \u201cLa Bamba\u201d and thousands of rollicking performances across the globe later, Los Lobos is surviving quite well -- and still jamming with the same raw intensity as they had when they began in that garage in 1973. They don\u2019t get in the studio as often as they did a few decades ago \u2013 Tin Can Trust came four years after their previous album of all originals, The Town and the City \u2013 but when they do, the results are every bit as culturally rich, musically rocking and lyrically provocative as they were back in the day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always the easiest thing finding time away from our touring schedule and families to find time to make an album,\u201d says Berlin, \u201cbut recording Gates of Gold, I have to say it\u2019s great to be back in the proverbial saddle again. It reminds us of the fun we have had making new music over the years, and it\u2019s nice to have the opportunity to create something of value.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nPerez adds, \u201cI find that the most interesting part of songwriting and tracking a new album is the differential between the way a song sounds to you at 2 a.m. and the way it may hit you when it\u2019s 11 a.m. and it reaches the light of day. We may love it just as much or we may realize we can do better. It\u2019s always a process of discovering more about ourselves and the music we love to make. It\u2019s not always easy getting started again, but I love that moment in the process when the songs start to take on their own life and we can let the kid, so to speak, run out onto the street and start figuring things out for himself. The way songs reveal themselves to us during these periods of writing and recording is my favorite part of the Los Lobos recording experience.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLouie Perez - Drums, Guitars, Percussion, Vocals \\r\\nSteve Berlin - Saxophone, Percussion, Flute, Midsax, Harmonica, Melodica \\r\\nCesar Rosas - Vocals, Guitar, Mandolin \\r\\nConrad Lozano - Bass, Guitarron, Vocals \\r\\nDavid Hidalgo - Vocals, Guitar, Accordion, Percussion, Bass, Keyboards, Melodica, Drums, Violin, Banjo \\r\\nEnrique \\\"Bugs\\\" Gonzalez - Drums/Percussion\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atjmbo.jpeg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":715},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atjmbo1.jpeg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atlg.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":223},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atlg1.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atmd.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":149},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atmd1.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-og.jpeg\",\"width\":1800,\"height\":1340},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atsm.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":74},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atsm1.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-sq.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-sqsm.jpeg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atxl.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":372},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atxxl.jpeg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":484},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/39/05-atxxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"W4mHTjQQrqk\",\"title\":\"Los Lobos - We Belong Together\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W4mHTjQQrqk\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"tao8rbrnfbc\",\"title\":\"Los Lobos - Don't Worry Baby\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tao8rbrnfbc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"4WDK16m1Ks4\",\"title\":\"Los Lobos - Come on, Let's Go ( La Bamba OST )\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WDK16m1Ks4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W4mHTjQQrqk\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.loslobos.org/site/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/LosLobosMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/loslobosband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"loslobosband\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1274009?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
