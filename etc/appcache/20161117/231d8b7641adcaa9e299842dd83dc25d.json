everybody seems to have a different account of who came first in the world of New York/New Jersey area thrash metal, it seems certain that New Jersey's Overkill have stayed around the longest, and have never let their fans down by remaining musically consistent and true to their roots for over 20 years and an unprecedented 14 full length albums. By 1987's Taking Over, the band had worked their way up to a deal with Atlantic Records. This relationship would last another 7 years based on the strength and consistency of Overkill's music.\\r\\n\\r\\n1988's Under The Influence and 1989's The Years Of Decay represent Overkill in their prime. Sid Falck would replace Rat Skates on drums to bring his own brutal percussive assault to Verni's already powerful rhythm section. The band had already established a rabid fan base with songs like \\\"Rotten To The Core\\\" and \\\"Hammerhead\\\" (as well as their infamous cover of D.O.A.'s \\\"Fuck You\\\"), and new songs like \\\"Evil Never Dies\\\" and \\\"Hello From The Gutter\\\" would become Overkill mainstays as well. A video for \\\"Hello From The Gutter\\\" was garnering much fan response when it received play on MTV's \\\"Headbangers Ball\\\". 1994's W.F.O. would be Overkill's final album with Atlantic, as they would release their first official full-length live assault, Wrecking Your Neck on CMC in 1995. 1996-1999 would see Overkill release 3 more full length albums (Killing Kind, From The Underground and Below, and Necroshine). In 2000, Overkill released Bloodletting on Metal-Is, adding guitarist Dave Linsk to the fray. The current Overkill lineup would be completed with the release of the live album Wrecking Everything and the addition of second guitarist Derek Tailer in 2002. Finally, Overkill would release one of their most well-received albums to date Killbox 13 on Spitfire Records in 2003. As fans rabidly await the imminent release of their latest contribution on Spitfire, ReliXIV, it seems obvious that Overkill are, and always have been, a band that knows who their fans are, knows what true metal fans expect, and will settle for nothing but the best from themselves. An entirely self-produced album, ReliXIV is a continuation of the Overkill legacy. Immortalis, the band..s 15th studio album was release in October 2007 via Bodog Music.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow with Nuclear Blast Records, it seems the band has finally found themselves a home:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Good to be with a label that understands what Overkill are about and what Metal is about in 2010, exciting!\\\" Bobby Blitz The upcoming album features Overkill's latest lineup, which, along with founders Bobby \\\"Blitz\\\" Ellsworth and D.D. Verni, includes guitarists Derek \\\"The Skull\\\" Tailer and Dave Linsk, as well as the newest member to join the band, drummer Ron Lipnicki.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are few names as well respected as Overkill, and with the resurgence of metal in the music world, this band is poised to return to the top. Overkill are ready to show mature metal heads they still have it and are geared up to teach the new schoolers exactly how it's done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ironbound\\\" is one hell of a thrashing piece which leads the band back to their oldschool roots!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":643},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":201},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-og.jpg\",\"width\":978,\"height\":655},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":335},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":435},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/39/55-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://wreckingcrew.com/Ironbound/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://myspace.com/overkill\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/OverkillWreckingCrew\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/overkillband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"overkillband\"},{\"id\":1284171,\"name\":\"Nile\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\\\"History is Philosophy teaching by examples.\\\" \u2013 Thucydides, Athenian historian, c. 460 \u2013 400 B.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's been said that one of humanity's greatest attributes is our desire to remember. In light of the ancient world's epic tales of invasion, occupation, conquest, enslavement, domination, and all-out war, situating history against the equally violent passages of death metal music in such a thorough a...nd reverent way had yet to be achieved until the birth of NILE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith films such as Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments, Land Of The Pharoahs, and Sodom And Gomorrah capturing his childhood imagination and driven by his own insatiable adult quest for unbridled sonic extremity, it was one nation's ancient culture \u2013 namely, Egypt \u2013 that fueled NILE founder, guitarist, vocalist, and head archeologist Karl Sanders' passion to learn of Egyptian gods and goddesses, temple carvings, inscriptions, papyri writings, hieroglyphics, and tomb paintings depicting battles, rituals, and religious ceremonies. Luckily, his encyclopedic knowledge has not been desecrated by amnesia. So vigorous did Sanders' zeal grow that it merged into the band's consciousness, elevating NILE into a peerless realm of flawlessly executed music and captivating lyrical content.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormed in 1993 by Sanders, bassist / vocalist Chief Spires, and drummer Pete Hammoura, then later augmented in 1996 by second guitarist Dallas Toler-Wade, NILE's symphonic arrangements unleashed a unique approach to their uncompromising technicality and Middle Eastern-tinged songwriting with their two EPs, Festivals Of Atonement (1995), Ramses Bringer Of War (1997), and their first full-length, 1998's Amongst The Catacombs Of Nephren-Ka. Rightfully earning themselves a world tour with Morbid Angel and a festival debut at Dynamo Open Air in 1999, NILE were quickly gaining an onslaught of new fans that revered them as one of metal's most devastating new bands. Once home (and with the assistance of drummer Derek Roddy after Hammoura tore his shoulder), Sanders and company began work assembling and arranging the song fragments and ideas that were fermenting while on the road. Every night was spent obsessively researching (the lyrics alone took a year to finalize!), composing, arranging and re-arranging before entering Soundlab Studios in Columbia, South Carolina with producer/engineer Bob Moore to record the result of their meticulous labor: the masterfully grandiose and cinematic Black Seeds Of Vengeance, Terrorizer Magazine's coveted \\\"Album Of The Year\\\" for the year 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelentless touring through the U.S. and Europe followed, and it would be two years before the band would return to work with Bob Moore at Soundlab Studios (with new vocalist & bassist Jon Vesano replacing Chief Spires and drummer Tony Laureano replacing Hammoura in tow) on In Their Darkened Shrines, enthusiastically commended by Terrorizer Magazine as \\\"a hair's breath from perfection\\\" and giving us the live staple \\\"Unas Slayer Of The Gods.\\\" NILE joined road forces with Arch Enemy, Napalm Death, Voivod, Strapping Young Lad, Danzig, Opeth, and Superjoint Ritual, made renowned appearances at Italy's Gods Of Metal and Fields Of Rock festivals, headlined in Japan for the first time, came back to the States to tour with Kreator and Vader, then returned to Europe for the X-Mass Festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, the band would rest before committing themselves to recording 2005's Annihilation Of The Wicked with engineer Bob Moore and producer/mixer Neil Kernon (Judas Priest, Nevermore) at Soundlab. Incorporating African choirs and the exotic instrumentations from sitars, tables, tempuras, and kettle drums, the album was summed up best by Guitar World Magazine who branded it \\\"the perfect soundtrack to a blinding, flesh-burning apocalypse.\\\" Showcasing the drum talents of George Kollias, Annihilation validated every accolade heaped upon NILE. Tours with King Diamond, then Hypocrisy & Decapitated followed in the U.S.; with Unleashed, Hate Eternal, and Behemoth and later Incantation and Dying Fetus through Europe; and a festival appearance at Norway's Hole In The Sky kept NILE on the road for over a year, leaving audiences in awe with their exhaustive work ethic, their tenacity & persistence, and their mind-numbing musicianship.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years and a new record label later, NILE return in the full glory of all their majestic malevolence. Clean, articulate, studied, and rooted in the algebraic drumming and incendiary blast-beats of George Kollias and the Mach-3 tandem guitar work and double-vocal assault of Sanders & Toler-Wade, Ithyphallic (referring to the ancient practice of portraying statues of gods with huge, mystically-proportioned phalluses as a sign of strength and fertility) continues to advance the scope and magnitude of death metal. A bold statement of ancient ferocity, NILE's fifth album is resplendent with epic arrangements and savage extremity and is testimony to the band's extreme range of expression manifested through a variety of tempos & time signatures and their intelligent subject matter, which \u2013 when combined - invokes an unmistakable power. Retaining the band's exceptionally high standard of sound is long-time engineer Bob Moore; Ithyphallic's sonic clarity comes courtesy of Neil Kernon's painstaking production.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo band has ever committed themselves so deeply within a subject matter as has NILE, as demonstrated by the tracks \\\"Ithyphallic,\\\" \\\"What Can Safely Be Written,\\\" \\\"The Essential Salts,\\\" and the ravaging \\\"Papyrus Containing The Spell To Preserve Its Possessor Against Attacks From He Who Is In The Water.\\\" \\\"Karl Sanders,\\\" observes Decibel Magazine, \\\"plays with one foot on the Great Pyramid, the other on Sirius B, and every atom of his considerable technique harnessed in the service of the Other.\\\" Noted for their individuality, NILE inspire the exploration of new paradigms among their colleagues. \\\" Ithyphallic is doomy, twisted, and warped, yet intricately crafted with brutal and intense clarity and pronunciation,\\\" writes Brave Words And Bloody Knuckles, \\\"a scourge that proves NILE is one of the most important death metal bands today.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf history is fundamentally a record of human interaction and if possessing knowledge of the past can grant us the key to our future, the question begs to be asked: are we doomed to live out the same horrors, the same curses, the same trappings of greed as have so many civilizations before us? Come.
