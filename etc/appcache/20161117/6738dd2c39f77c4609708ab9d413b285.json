Pieced together while on the road, and recorded over five weeks in Newcastle Under Lyme\u2019s Silk Mill Studio in May 2016 with producer Tristan Ivemy (Frank Turner, The Holloways), it is Skinny Lister\u2019s most far-reaching, exciting and accomplished album yet. It\u2019s a full-on rock record that splashes even more punk vigour and eighties pop elements across their fervent folk canvas, taking in hints of Adam Ant and The Clash. It also brings the folk storytelling tradition bang up to date with its brutally honest and close to the knuckle lyrics of real-life stories (\u2018Geordie Lad\u2019, \u2018Charlie\u2019) and on-the-road mayhem, the Pogue-ish \u2018Hamburg Drunk\u2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nA mature, vibrant and varied record, it mingles classic Skinny folk romances (\u2018Grace\u2019, \u2018Reunion\u2019) with epic rock takes on rafter-rattling shanties (\u2018Beat It From The Chest\u2019) and hearty Dexys-style tributes to the fans they meet on the road (\u2018Fair Winds & Following Seas\u2019), plus a hitherto unseen darker side. Take the deceptively upbeat \u2018Injuries\u2019, Dan\u2019s ode on the bruising nature of life, or \u2018Devil In Me\u2019, in which Lorna comes on like a particularly melodic Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction: \u201cthe devil in me will come for you and you\u2019ll pay the price for not being very nice\u2026 you took my life, I\u2019m taking yours, that seems to me a fair trade\u201d. Gulp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2018The Devil, The Heart & The Fight\u2019 is like Skinny\u2019s previous albums gone backpacking; expanding its horizons, full of adventure, discovering itself and doing things it regrets in the morning. Have heart, ye devils, join the fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of the 5 weeks recording the album, Skinny Lister have spent the last 18 months on the road touring across the UK, Europe and North America to ever-increasing crowds. Their infectious, feel-good and uplifting performances are winning over fans all across the globe, whether its supporting label mate Frank Turner on his arena tours or headlining their own sold out shows across America. They\u2019re a twelve-legged party machine and one of the best live bands in the country. See for yourself on their biggest headline tour to date throughout October. Dates below. \\r\\nBefore that though, Skinny will be performing a special album announcement party in their adopted home town of Hastings at The Albion on 28th July 2016.

That small army of rogues and rebels, drifters and dreamers, soldiers and schemers populate his songs, their tragedies and comedies, their lives and deaths recalled in his finely etched musical vignettes.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Minnesota-born, Wisconsin-based tunesmith and teller of tales (both tall and true), returns with his second effort Rangers & Valentines (Xtra Mile Recordings). The record follows his critically acclaimed 2012 debut Run Engine, Run, with his band the Shades. That LP earned notices in Rolling Stone, American Songwriter and Paste, with the folks at Huffington Post calling him a \\\"master storyteller\\\" and PBS hailing his \\\"story songs that explore and explode the conventions of rock and roll.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Rangers & Valentines, Schoepp defies the limitations of the standard-issue Americana platter, hopping genres \u2013 you'll hear lots of brass, backing singers and B-3 \u2014 as the songs build to delirious musical highs. His narratives, meanwhile, find subjects in the narrow margins of society, the strange twists (literal and metaphorical) in the weather, and the vagaries of a troubadour's transient life \u2013 with lyrics that flash a lacerating wit and humanist streak that's at the core of his craft.  \\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by pop polymath and Raconteurs member Brendan Benson at his Readymade Studios in Nashville, the record finds Schoepp handling vocals, guitar and harmonica. He's aided by an array of estimable musicians including his brother and musical-foil-since-birth Tanner Schoepp (providing bass guitar and vocal harmonies), Steve Selvidge (The Hold Steady), John Davis (Superdrag), the McCrary Sisters \u2014 even comedian and WTF podcaster Marc Maron chips in on background vocals and lead guitar.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSchoepp shines up the well-worn clich\u00e9s of singer-songwriterdom and renders them anew. Evoking a series of vivid protagonists and settings (fittingly, each track will have its own accompanying video, solidifying the cinematic quality of this set) his work variously recalls prime Prine (John, that is), the nuances of Newman (Randy, of course), the boozy bonhomie of The Replacements, and the unflinching language of someone well-versed in the Zevonian dialect.    \\r\\n\\r\\nSchoepp mixes fact and family lore to conjure the hardscrabble history \\\"Ballad of Olof Johnson\\\" and chides modern-day wannabes on \\\"Lost Cowboy.\\\" The road story \\\"Ogalalla\\\" answers the question: what happens to your mind when you're snowbound in Nebraska with nothing but a bottle of Nyquil and The Hobbit at the local picture show for company? Meanwhile, the arch love song satire \\\"Talking Girlfriend Blues\\\" deftly explains how to preserve your dignity while hitchhiking to a date \u2013 and what to do when your ride turns out to have eyes for the same girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere, \\\"Don't Go\\\" offers a poetic post-9/11 story of love and war; while \\\"Settlin' or Sleepin' Around\\\" questions modern-day swipe right, hook up culture. Schoepp continues his affinity for songs set in hospitals with \\\"Mono Pt. II\\\" \u2013 which explores the kissing disease and the institutional runaround of health care in America (unfortunately a familiar subject for the young man).  And he pays tribute to old friends and outsized characters with \\\"For Jonny\\\" (dedicated to his longtime drummer Jonny Philip) and the heart-rending requiem \\\"Dream.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving released his debut on SideOneDummy, Rangers & Valentines is being put out by London-based Xtra Mile Recordings. Hipped to Schoepp's work by fellow singer-songwriter Frank Turner, among others, Xtra Mile honcho Charlie Caplowe quickly signed him to the label.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchoepp \u2013 who's already crisscrossed the country sharing stages with fellow travelers like The Wallflowers, The Jayhawks and The Old 97's \u2013 will be back on the road throughout 2016 in support of Ranger & Valentines, starting with a 3-week run throughout the UK and Europe supporting Jesse Malin.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the album, it'll be another opportunity to catch a young journeyman at work.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":538},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":538},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":168},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":168},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":112},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":112},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-og.jpg\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":560},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":56},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":56},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":280},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":280},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":364},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/34/89-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":364}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"sJ3J1rj1kvA\",\"title\":\"Trapper Schoepp \u2022 \\\"Ogallala\\\" \u2022 Official Video\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJ3J1rj1kvA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"utz-eI4_QX8\",\"title\":\"Trapper Schoepp & The Shades - \\\"Tracks\\\" (Official Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/utz-eI4_QX8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sJ3J1rj1kvA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://www.trapperschoepp.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/trapperschoepp\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/trapperschoepp\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"trapperschoepp\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1183121?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
