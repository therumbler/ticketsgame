He's a musical maverick and iconoclast adored by millions of fans around the\\r\\nworld. Through his seminal work with KISS and as a solo artist, Ace Frehley is championed as one\\r\\nof the most influential guitar players of the last four decades and his impact on popular music is\\r\\nimmeasurable. With his smash 1978 solo album and postKISS\\r\\nwork including 2009 Anomaly,\\r\\nFrehley continues to be the best selling member of the original band.\\r\\nA career in music was in the cards for Ace from the very beginning. \\\"I decided when I was sixteen\\r\\nyearsold\\r\\nthat I wanted to be a professional musician,\\\" Frehley asserts. \\\"Not only did I decide that\\r\\nbut I always felt that I was gonna make it. I've always had the power of foresight and I felt it was\\r\\ndestiny for me. I knew it was gonna happen, if it wasn't with KISS it would have happened with\\r\\nsomeone else. I distinctly remember seeing Led Zeppelin, Cream and The Who, all groups who I\\r\\nadmired tremendously, but at the same time there was a little voice in the back of my head going,\\r\\n\\\"You can do that too.\\\" Early on, Ace recognized the importance of fusing explosive musicality with\\r\\n\\\"look at me ma\\\" showmanship. \\\"The Who was a big inspiration on me. The day I saw The Who play\\r\\nfor the first time in 1967 at the RKO Theater changed my life. Seeing Pete Townshend made me\\r\\nrealize playing live onstage wasn't just about peeling off impressive licks but you have to entertain\\r\\ntoo. I knew then that I wanted to do something musical and theatrical. I remember playing in high\\r\\nschool bands and lighting off smoke bombs (laughs). I painted dayglo\\r\\nflowers on my drummer's\\r\\ndrums and put a black light in front of the kit so it would glow. I put lights in a guitar when I was\\r\\neighteenyearsold.\\\"\\r\\nHeavily inspired by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and Pete Townshend, Ace\\r\\nFrehley was a devoted student of rock and roll, practicing his craft by studiously listening to records\\r\\nby those classic players and treating them as sacred music scrolls. Little did the Bronx born\\r\\nmusician know that years later the tables would be turned and his revolutionary sixstring\\r\\naxe work\\r\\nas a member of KISS and a solo artist would inspire millions of guitars players around the globe to\\r\\nfollow in his footsteps. Pearl Jam's Stone Gossard, Lenny Kravitz and the late Dimebag Darrell of\\r\\nPantera are amongst the numerous artists whom have pointed to the legendary guitarist as a\\r\\nprofound inspiration. It's an honor that Frehley acknowledges with characteristic modesty. \\\"I don't\\r\\nthink much about how I influenced a whole generation of guitar players because that idea is so big\\r\\n(laughs). I'm not egotistical and I try to be humble about all facets of my life but it's kind of mind\\r\\nblowing to know I was a huge influence on a new crop of guitar players in the same way that people\\r\\nlike Hendrix, Page, Beck and Townshend had an impact on me. I was influenced by all those\\r\\nplayers and now I'm lucky enough to have that kind of influence on guitar players younger than me\\r\\nthat grew up listening to KISS and Ace Frehley. It goes full circle and it's the way that rock and roll\\r\\nevolves. It's a good feeling and it makes me feel proud. I hear my influence on some players and it\\r\\njust puts a smile on my face and gives me a little hop in my step.\\\" (laughs)\\r\\nMore than four decades ago, Ace Frehley was rewarded with that life changing, big break that all\\r\\naspiring musicians can only dream about. Answering a \\\"Guitar Player Wanted\\\" ad in New\\r\\nYork's Village Voice weekly newspaper, the struggling 22yearold\\r\\nmusician showed up to an\\r\\naudition for a new hard rock band at a seedy downtown loft with egg crates hastily plastered to the\\r\\nwalls to act as a noise buffer for the sonic commotion unfolding inside. Ever the individualist,\\r\\nFrehley famously turned up wearing one red and orange sneaker and dutifully blasted off some of\\r\\nhis signature fiery licks, leaving proverbial jaws on the ground and reducing all other candidates to\\r\\ndust. Having \\\"aced\\\" his tryout, he joined forces with Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley and Peter Criss\\r\\nand KISS was born. Signed to fledgling new label Casablanca Records, KISS took the music world\\r\\nby storm. Wearing garish makeup and decked out in outrageous costumes, love them or hate them\\r\\nKISS was a band you would never forget. Borrowing elements of their look from shockrock\\r\\nmaster\\r\\nAlice Cooper and comic books, and horror films, the band's glorious tsunami of sound drew sweaty\\r\\ninspiration from the best of Led Zeppelin, Humble Pie, The Who, Rolling Stones and others.\\r\\nDefying critics who slammed them as talented clowns in black leather and sixinch\\r\\nheels, KISS\\r\\nkicked down the doors of convention with the perfect triumvirate of explosive music, unforgettable\\r\\nimage and spectacular stage show. \\\"Once we started playing live and we found our niche, I really\\r\\ngot the sense that it was gonna go somewhere, Frehley recalls. \\\"Everyone in the band was on the\\r\\nsame page back then. Everyone was committed in their own way. Gene did a lot on the publicity\\r\\nend because at the time we didn't have a publicist. (laughs) In essence, in the beginning Gene was\\r\\nour publicist. I was more of the design guy\u2014I designed the KISS logo\u037e I suggested Paul put one\\r\\nstar on his eye. We all worked together as a team.\\\" The group's tireless work ethic and unshakable\\r\\ncommitment to do anything to make it helped catapult KISS to stardom on the heels of their\\r\\nseminal 1975 album, Alive! For the next several years, through such albums as Destroyer, Rock\\r\\nand Roll Over and Love Gun, KISS became an international phenomenon, racking up multiplatinum\\r\\nrecords and sold out concerts around the globe. For Frehley, the realization that KISS was now one\\r\\nof the biggest bands in the world came \\\"when we played three nights at Madison Square Garden.\\r\\nThat was a pretty special three days. It was our hometown and here we are playing Madison Square\\r\\nGarden. It was where we struggled in our early days rehearsing in a small loft and playing small\\r\\nclubs. That's when it really sank in that we had made it big.\\\"\\r\\nAs both a showman and musician, Frehley made an indelible impact on popular culture as a\\r\\nmember of KISS. Whether firing rockets off his guitar, bringing crowds to delirium with his smoking\\r\\nguitar effect or impressing fans with his explosive fleet fingered sixstring\\r\\nguitar work, in a band not\\r\\nrenowned for its playing ability, he drew critical and public accolades for his accomplished\\r\\nmusicianship. Taking a break from KISSmania,\\r\\nin September of '78 the band members released\\r\\nfour separate solo albums. Ace Frehley's debut solo album was by far the runaway biggest seller,\\r\\nspawning the smash hit, \\\"New York Groove.\\\" \\\"Eddie Kramer's assistant suggested we cut 'New\\r\\nYork Groove', recounted Frehley. \\\"When I first heard the song I wasn't too keen on tracking it but\\r\\nEddie pushed me and said, \\\"C'mon Ace, you should try it.\\\" After we recorded it I still didn't think\\r\\nthat it was really the right song for me to do. It's not the kind of song I would ever write. But what do\\r\\nI know, it turned out to be my biggest hit!\\\" (laughs) The ramifications of his surprise success as a\\r\\nsolo artist were far reaching as Ace explains: \\\"The success of my '78 solo album definitely planted\\r\\nthe seed for my eventually leaving KISS to pursue a solo career. I felt I was more creative apart from\\r\\nthe guys than with them. The success of my solo album opened my eyes and made me a little\\r\\nmore cocky. It made me realize that I had the ability to do it on my own.\\\"\\r\\nSplitting from KISS in the early eighties, the first fruits of Ace's creative efforts came in 1987 with\\r\\nhis new band, Frehley's Comet and eponymous debut album, which yielded the FM radio hit, \\\"Into\\r\\nthe Night,\\\" a track penned by Russ Ballard who also wrote Frehley's signature '78 smash \\\"New\\r\\nYork Groove\\\". From there, Frehley was on a roll, issuing a string of wellreceived\\r\\nsolo\\r\\nalbumsSecond\\r\\nSighting, Live + One and Trouble Walkin'each\\r\\ndemonstrating his spectacular\\r\\nsixstring\\r\\nabilities and immense gift for crafting imaginative and arena ready rockers was safely\\r\\nintact. Looking back Frehley observes: \\\"I enjoyed the freedom of going solo but it was scary. Once\\r\\nI'd actually left KISS and it sank in, I realized that the other three guys in the group did more than I\\r\\nthought. I soon found out it's a much bigger undertaking to go solo than I'd anticipated. I have fond\\r\\nmemories of the Frehley's Comet days. That first lineup was great and it evolved over the years. We\\r\\nput out some good music and were a really good live band. It was a lot of fun playing with those\\r\\nguys. If I wouldn't have run into trouble with drugs and alcohol I think the band would have gone a lot\\r\\nfurther. But we all have our demons and we deal with them in different ways.\\\"\\r\\nReuniting with KISS in 1996, Frehley teamed up with his old mates for a spectacularly successful\\r\\nfiveyear\\r\\nrun numbering sold out concerts around the globe and high profile appearances at the\\r\\nSuper Bowl and the Olympics. Splitting from the group in 2001 after their \\\"Farewell Tour\\\", Frehley\\r\\nneeded to recharge his creative batteries and took a much needed sabbatical after decades in the\\r\\nrock and roll circus. Eight years later, to the eternal joy of his loyal fan base, in 2009 \\\"Space Ace\\\"\\r\\nreturned to the music scene with his first new studio album in twenty years. A commercial and\\r\\nartistic triumph, Anomaly, proved to be his highest charting album since his classic 1978 solo\\r\\ndebut. In 2011, he added yet another accolade to his mantel as a New York Times best selling\\r\\nbook author with No Regrets, a hard hitting and honest account of his tumultuous career.\\r\\nHaving battled substance abuse for decades, in 2014 Frehley is seven years clean and sober and\\r\\ndriven by a newfound\\r\\ncommitment and focus to his artistry. On December 17, 2013 Ace and the\\r\\noriginal lineup of KISS was nominated into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in the 2014 class.\\r\\nEntertainment One Music is proud to announce the addition of the legendary Ace Frehley to its\\r\\nroster. His new solo album, as yet untitled, is due for release in the spring of 2014 and promises to\\r\\nforge yet another exciting chapter in the life of one of rock's most influential and distinctive artists.\\r\\n\\\"Fans can expect something closer to my '78 solo record,\\\" Frehley reveals. \\\"Over the past couple of\\r\\nmonths I've been listening to my old records and trying to find that formula that I've captured so\\r\\nmany times in the past. I recently played some of my new music for a few people at my label and\\r\\nthey were blown away. It reaffirmed in my mind that I'm on the right path and I think my fans are\\r\\ngoing to love the results. It's gonna be a great record.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":750,\"height\":416},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":750,\"height\":416},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":166},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":166},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":111},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":111},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-og.jpg\",\"width\":750,\"height\":416},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":55},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":55},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":277},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":277},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":361},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/64/41-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":361}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.acefrehley.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/officialacefrehley\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ace_frehley\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ace_frehley\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1750537,\"name\":\"Enuff Z'nuff\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Enuff Z'nuff is an American melodic rock band from Blue Island, Illinois.
