With its lyrical thunderbolts, lightning-flash fretwork and ground-shaking grooves, Black Wind Howlin' is a record to blow your roof off \u2013 and Samantha Fish has stood at the eye of the hurricane. \\\"It has a rebellious streak,\\\" says the bandleader of her game-changing new album, \\\"and a prevalent theme is, 'I'm not gonna take your sh*t anymore\u2026'\\\"\\r\\nReleased in September 2013 on Ruf Records, Black Wind Howlin' flips a finger at the clich\u00e9 of the 'difficult second album', firing off 12 classic tracks that chart Samantha's evolution as songwriter, gunslinger and lyricist. \\\"Since completing Runaway back in 2011,\\\" she reflects of her solo debut, \\\"I've been on tour pretty much non-stop. I've spent a lot of time writing, playing and listening to music. I feel like the themes and the sound of my music have matured. To me, it's about the human experience from my perspective, as well as people I've come into contact with over the last few years.\\\" \\r\\nWhile lesser artists work to a template or settle into a pigeonhole, Samantha shifts her shape across the Black Wind Howlin' tracklisting. She can be brutally rocking on cuts like the tour bus snapshot of \\\"Miles To Go\\\" (\\\"Twelve hours to Reno/ten hours til the next show\\\"), the swaggering \\\"Sucker Born\\\" (\\\"Vegas left me weary, LA bled me dry/skating on fumes as I crossed the Nevada line\u2026\\\") and the venomous \\\"Go To Hell\\\" (\\\"Oh, this ain't my first rodeo/You hit yourself a dead end/Your voodoo eyes, ain't gonna cast a spell/So you can go to hell!\\\"). \\\"I've become tougher,\\\" she notes of these head-banging moments, \\\"and I think that was reflected in the sound we went for.\\\"   \\r\\nAnd yet, elsewhere, backed by the versatile production of Royal Southern Brotherhood guitarist and longtime collaborator Mike Zito, you'll find Samantha shifting gears to the aching slide-guitar balladry of \\\"Over You\\\" (\\\"Echoing words, said I'd never make it on my own\u2026\\\") and the redemptive country strum, \\\"Last September\\\" (\\\"Don't remember the curves of my face/Can't feel the warmth in my embrace/Well I'm here to remind you\u2026\\\"). \\r\\nShe might stop off for a gritty cover of Howlin' Wolf's \\\"Who's Been Talking,\\\" and co-wrote \\\"Go To Hell\\\" with Zito, but all other tracks are Samantha's self-penned originals, and it's a mix to keep listeners on their toes. \\\"I wanted this record to have a modern rocking sound,\\\" she explains of the light-footed vibe. \\\"I also wanted it to have elements of Americana, country and roots.\\\" \\r\\nThe sessions proved just as rewarding as the writing. As a seasoned road warrior who will spend much of 2013 burning tarmac, recording at Dockside Studios in Maurice, Louisiana was a rare chance for Samantha to put down roots, flanked by a first-call band that included Royal Southern Brotherhood rhythm section Yonrico Scott (drums) and Charlie Wooton (bass), back-up guitar and vocals from Zito, plus guest appearances from Johnny Sansone (harmonica), Bo Thomas (fiddle on \\\"Last September\\\") and Paul Thorn (vocals on \\\"Go To Hell\\\"). \\\"I had a dream team of musicians and special guests,\\\" she recalls. \\\"And Dockside Studios quickly became one of my favorite places on earth.\\\"\\r\\nBut it was another venue, some years earlier, that set Samantha on her musical path. The songwriter recalls her first musical taste as the classic rock of The Rolling Stones and Tom Petty, alongside contemporary artists like Sheryl Crow and The Black Crowes, but after several underage clandestine visits to the Knuckleheads Saloon blues club in her native Kansas City, she followed the thread from modern masters like Zito and Tab Benoit, through fallen '80s heroes like Stevie Ray Vaughan, right back to the pre-war Delta masters. \\\"I fell in love with it,\\\" she told Premier Guitar of her growing passion for the form, \\\"and started doing my homework by listening to the old guys like Son House and Skip James.\\\"\\r\\nSoon enough, appreciation for the blues had spilled over into application, and by the age of 18, Samantha had settled on a searing lead guitar style that expressed her own voice rather than mimicking the clich\u00e9d blues licks note-for-note. Home practice didn't scratch the itch, and she broke into a dues-paying period on the Kansas City jam circuit: an apprenticeship at the sharp end that tightened her musical chops, polished her stagecraft and gave her the grit to overcome occasional skepticism about her age, hair tone and gender. \\\"I always hated the idea of the gimmick,\\\" she told Premier Guitar. \\\"People come out just because you are a girl, but then you have so much more to prove once you get them in the door.\\\"\\r\\nBut Samantha got them in \u2013 and kept them in \u2013 and after an early live recording from Knuckleheads found its way into the hands of label supremo Thomas Ruf, the young bandleader's trajectory was changed from dreamer to signed artist. Fish's first appointment for the label was to join Cassie Taylor and Dani Wilde on the 2011 Girls With Guitars album: a whip-cracking three-female release that the trio doused with added rocket fuel on Ruf's famous Blues Caravan tour of Europe and the US that year. \\\"I don't get that whole competitive thing, especially when I play with the girls,\\\" insisted Samantha. \\\"When you start trying to get over the top of somebody, you lose what makes it great. That's when you lose the musical aspect of it.\\\"\\r\\nWith her name buzzing on the blues scene and the iron hot, Samantha struck again that same year with Runaway, her solo debut on Ruf. With ten hot tracks \u2013 of which nine were originals \u2013 and production once again from Zito, this was a debut album that announced the depth of this newcomer's talent, mixing up gutsy riff-blues rockers like \\\"Down In The Swamp\\\" with the mellow small-hours jazz of \\\"Feelin' Alright,\\\" while marinating her songwriting in the groove of the Rolling Stones and even tipping a hat to Heart. \\\"It's all the sounds I grew up with,\\\" she explained, \\\"with my own spin.\\\"\\r\\nHitting a receptive international rock press, Runaway was hailed as a thrilling opening gambit, earning a string of rave reviews and accolades, of which the Blues Music Award (BMA) for 'Best New Artist Debut' in 2012 was perhaps the most auspicious. \\\"I'm truly humbled by the recognition,\\\" Samantha admitted. \\\"I can barely wait to make record number two\u2026\\\"\\r\\nSo here it is. Harder, darker, bolder and better than even its revered predecessor, this is the sound of an artist on the brink of the big-time with both hands on the wheel. \\\"I really got to do exactly what I wanted to do on Black Wind Howlin',\\\" says Samantha, \\\"and I'm incredibly proud of it\u2026\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/00/21-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.SAMANTHAFISH.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/samanthafishblues\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/samanthafishmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Samantha_Fish\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Samantha_Fish\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1394265,\"name\":\"Lightnin Malcolm\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Lightnin Malcolm has come to exemplify the modern day Deep Blues Guitar groove. Its a sound which traces back to the origins of blues, when a single guitarist rocked the house all night long. When these ancient droning patterns consisting of bass, rhythm, and lead syncopated together are plugged into modern sound systems and teamed up with driving drum beats, Malcolms guitar becomes larger than life, bringin state of the art primal Mississippi Juke Joint Blues to the big stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sound didn't just come out of nowhere. Born in Missouri in mid 70s, Malcolm started playing his music and traveling on the road in his late teens. He lived his music, playing night and day where ever the road took him, surviving off his versatility. \\\"Music had been on my mind since 6 or 7, but it took till my teen years to start gettin around on my own, and you know, put it into action. I played mostly solo then, playin guitar,singing, and kick and snare drums with my feet as a 1 man band.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis travels took him all over but it was North Mississippi that he identified with most and took him in. He immediately befriended and began performing with many of the Legends living there such as Big Jack Johnson, Cedell Davis, R.L. Burnside, Hubert Sumlin, Honeyboy Edwards, T Model Ford, Sam Carr, Jessie Mae Hemphill, Otha Turner, Robert Belfour and many others. Over thousands of nights playing the rough and tumble juke joints, soaking up the rhythms and culture, Malcolm learned to be an alert and durable performer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I used to show up at juke joints solo, and they would be listenin' to the jukebox and everybody dancin' to Al Green, Johnnie Taylor, and Tyrone Davis. Then they would shut the jukebox off and stick me out in the middle of the floor\u2026and man I'd be so nervous cuz the jukebox sounded so good and I didn't think they would accept or want to hear me\u2026 But this was how I was surviving and failure was not an option\u2026 You had to win them over on the first song or you wasn't gonna get another try! Guitar solos weren't important but basslines and rhythm was mandatory for the dancers, and you had to sing with everything you got! And once you won them over you was bout to have the greatest night of your life!!\\r\\nFresh off the road Lightnin' Malcolm forges ahead with his new album \\\"Renegade.\\\" The album is due out on April 12 on Ruf Records. \\\"Renegade\\\" is high energy, hill country blues fused with modern elements of funk, reggae, soul, and rock. It features 13 new original songs all written and produced by Lightnin' Malcolm. \\r\\n\\r\\nRecorded in Clarksdale, MS \\\"Renegade\\\" is a guitar and drums duo recording, played live and raw in the North Mississippi hill country tradition. Joining Lightnin' on drums is Cameron Kimbrough, grandson of blues legend Jr. Kimbrough. Cameron's creative energy, versatile playing, combined with his natural family talent creates a perfect fit for Malcolm's hypnotic grooves. Renegade also features a horn section on a few tracks comprised of Jim Spake, David McKnight, and Nahshon Benford. Lightnin' befriended the trio while touring with the popular Americana act Lucero. Nadirah Shakoor (Jimmy Buffet) lends her beautiful voice on the reggae flavored \\\"Precious Jewel.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA Renegade by definition is an individual who rejects lawful or conventional behavior. The concept of Renegade closely reflects the turbulent lifestyle of a traveling musician. The authenticity of the music certainly permeates as a result on this album.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\" The songs on this album are definitely the result of years livin' the renegade lifestyle. The renegade cuts against the grain, doin' things his own way on his own terms. I've always tried to be a right doin' person, to help people around me...I follow the laws of the universe, not the laws of man...I know right from wrong. Most times your on your own, movin' from place to place with your guitar and your music..\\\"at the same time interacting, entertaining, jamming, working, helping, teaching, learning, singing, dancing, sleeping, and living with all the people that come through your life. You are what you've done and the legacy you leave behind is the life you live everyday. Its all about the music and the only way to play it is to live it,\\\" says Lightnin' Malcolm. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe music unites musicians and audience as they interact in a hypnotic dance with everybody rejoicing to the power and joy of the music we call the Blues!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1441},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-og.jpg\",\"width\":1066,\"height\":1600},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":976},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.lightninmalcolm.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lightnin-Malcolm/142957862420209\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1378387?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
