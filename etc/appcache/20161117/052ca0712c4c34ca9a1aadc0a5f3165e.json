At once raw and exposed, pure and unerringly precise, his vocals are able to veer between choirboy cantillation, torch-singer croon, and full-throated bellow without losing a character that is unmistakably his own. And his compositional aesthetic\\u2014which manages to encompass both the unpretentious bounce of popular song and moments of ominous stasis, setting his own, emotionally intimate lyrics or penning purely instrumental interludes\\u2014demands that elasticity.\\nHis other instruments are a little out of the ordinary, as well: in addition to singing, Landau beats and bows on a small battery of percussion instruments. But as a vocalist, a composer, and as a percussionist, Landau insinuates himself effortlessly into every layer of music-making on the album. The truly remarkable thing about this project is how naturally Landau brings together the large circle of collaborators responsible for making this album happen. Simply put, Jodie Landau plays well with others.\\nwild Up\\u00a0| \\u00a0Beth Morrison Projects\\nMore Info\",\"artists\":[{\"name\":\"Jodie Landau\",\"mbid\":null,\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistLarge.jpg\",\"thumb_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/artistThumb.jpg\",\"facebook_tour_dates_url\":\"http://www.bandsintown.com/JodieLandau/facebookapp?came_from=67\",\"facebook_page_url\":null,\"tracker_count\":102,\"url\":\"JodieLandau\",\"website\":null}],\"venue\":{\"name\":\"National Sawdust\",\"place\":\"National Sawdust\",\"city\":\"Brooklyn\",\"region\":\"NY\",\"country\":\"United States\",\"latitude\":40.718877,\"longitude\":-73.961362}}]\n",
