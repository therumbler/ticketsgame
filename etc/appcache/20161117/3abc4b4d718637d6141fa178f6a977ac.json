His voice is the snotty one. His guitar is the lead one.\\r\\nMark 'BBQ' Sultan: drums, guitar, vocals. His voice is the smooth one. His guitar is the rhythmic one. The drums are played live with his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBad News Boys is the band's fourth studio album, their latest since 2009's acclaimed Invisible Girl. The boys had previously broken up in 2010 after a taxing stretch, culminating in an invite by Lou Reed to play the Sydney Opera House. There was a public (internet) break-up and freak-out, which carried over into the week after in Asia. Words were said; brothers fought like brothers. It was the end of a stretch that had taken the band all over North America, playing festivals like Coachella, starting side projects like Almighty Defenders (with brothers Black Lips), touring the likes of Europe, Israel, Brazil, gaining legions of devoted fans internationally, and kickstarting that whole 'doo-wop punk' bullshit movement that still goes on today. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is rock'n'roll. This is punk. This is early r&b. This is psych. This is doo-wop.  This is garage. It's all this and more, without trying to be anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nA misconception of the band is that they play a bunch of instruments, which are then overdubbed to get a particular sound in the studio. The truth is that they record live. Their 'studio' is usually an apartment or \u2013 in the case of Bad News Boys \u2013 a basement, and they're armed a 4-track cassette recorder and not much else. Their ethos is punk. Their mission is to revere rock'n'roll \u2013 the real stuff \u2013 enough, so that they are permitted to invoke its spirits and ghosts using magick, using their raw soul - for good or for bad - to evoke the smells and feelings that confuse and delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King Khan & BBQ Show is a real band. Sure, their sense of humor is dirty, often surreal and potentially subversive, but the seriousness of their passion for real rock'n'roll should never be taken lightly. They live a lifestyle of pure love for the genre, respecting and understanding its basic tenets, living as lifers, representatives of tradition they feel is important. They cut their teeth together in The Spaceshits, a lightning fast rock'n'roll band formed in 1995 (dead by 1998) and have toured and paid their dues since, sacrificing their mind, bodies, souls, friends, family - all for love.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Khan went on to underground hero status in many projects, shocking and impressing tastemakers in need of tangible image-icons, worldwide. Mark Sultan is heralded for his incredible voice and top-tier songwriting \u2013 rarities, today. Quite simply: they need one another, like yin and yang, to make it all happen. The band has managed to continue to release top-grade material for over ten years, without bowing to business or succumbing to what's 'hip', without changing. They do what they want, take it or leave it. Love 'em or hate 'em, but never say they can't write a great rock'n'roll song \u2013 and back it up with one of the best, most magickal, energetic, crass and nonsensical free-form live shows going. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey care so much that they don't give a fuck.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atjmbo.JPG\",\"width\":960,\"height\":720},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atjmbo1.JPG\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atlg.JPG\",\"width\":300,\"height\":225},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atlg1.JPG\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atmd.JPG\",\"width\":200,\"height\":150},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atmd1.JPG\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-og.JPG\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1536},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atsm.JPG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":75},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atsm1.JPG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-sq.JPG\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-sqsm.JPG\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atxl.JPG\",\"width\":500,\"height\":375},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atxl1.JPG\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atxxl.JPG\",\"width\":650,\"height\":487},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/55-atxxl1.JPG\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://badnewsboys.tumblr.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/thekingkhanbbqshow\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/thekingkhanbbqshow\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/kkbbqshow\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"kkbbqshow\"},{\"id\":1693791,\"name\":\"Paint Fumes\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"PAINT FUMES drew first blood together in the year 2011, sharing a mutual love of garage scuzz and brain-chain reaction, and the connection was immediate and fierce. Sounds congealed via weekly seances at the Sewercide Mansion in Charlotte, NC and relentless touring which brought their unhinged reverberations to points all across the USA. Like the lovechild of Link Wray and Cheetah Chrome, raised by Lemmy on the streets of Venus, they sweated out the fever every night in ecstatic style. By the time Slovenly Recs got around to spitting out a couple classic 45s and their debut platter Uck Life, most true heads and even those way out of the know alike had gotten the message. Deep within a blitzkrieg of treble and feedback, there were real live tunes to sink your teeth into \u2013 the stuff that's stuck in your head when you wake up in another dimension.\\r\\nIn the year of the horse, the 'Fumes swelled in ranks with Ian Rose and Ben Carr of NC synthtopian punks Natural Causes, starting twelve thrash bands and surviving on nothing but hallucinations of vegetarian chimichangas. Together this crew ruined the beaches of Europe with Los Vigilantes, converted hundreds on the all-night diesel-powered festival circuit and in the midst of it all took a vacation down to Puerto Rico and committed to tape a new full-length entitled If it ain't Paint Fumes it ain't worth a huff!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":864,\"height\":576},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-og.jpg\",\"width\":864,\"height\":576},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/26/39/57-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://slovenly.bandcamp.com/album/paint-fumes-uck-life-lp\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Paintfumes\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1303409?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
