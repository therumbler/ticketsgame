But a wake\u2010up call is long overdue, and this is it. Actually, not just a wake\u2010up call, but a joyous reunion of rock with its oft\u2010forgotten prodigal twin, the roll \u2010 with papa blues and mama soul along for the ride, too. All of which makes Pardon Me the perfect introduction to one of the most electrifying young bands in America \u2010 or at least the next best thing to experiencing Jonathan Tyler and the Northern Lights live. Literally.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon't be fooled by the good Southern manners implied by the title of Pardon Me, the major\u2010label debut by Dallas' Jonathan Tyler and the Northern Lights. The walloping roundhouse punch of Pardon Me's lead\u2010off title track and everything else packed into Tyler and Co.'s Texas\u2010sized can of rock 'n' roll whoopass. \\\"Hey!' Tyler shouts after the opening salvo of guitars lands like a gauntlet slap across the face. \\\"Can you hear me? Can you feel me, coming through your stereo?' Then comes the coup\u2010de\u2010grace, a shot of Hendrix\u2010laced adrenaline plunged deep into the listener's heart and soul by a diabolically persuasive Dr. Feelgood. \\\"Maybe it's been too long since rock 'n' roll turned you on,' sneers Tyler, with equal measures of promise and threat. \\\"So pardon me, just let it set you free.'\\r\\nAnd that's when things get loud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We recorded it live,' Tyler says of the Pardon Me sessions in Nashville with producer Jay Joyce (known for his work with Cage The Elephant, John Hiatt, Patty Griffin, Audio Adrenaline, Crowded House). \\\"We were really critical about keeping things in the pocket and giving it a groove, but letting the songs breathe and feel alive was the main thing that was really important to us. And because we'd played those songs so much before going into the studio, for the most part it wasn't that hard. We didn't really pull our hair out over any of the songs.'\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's clear from the finished results \u2010 be it storming rockers like \\\"Young & Free' and \\\"Gypsy Woman' or gut\u2010wrenching, slow\u2010burning beauties like \\\"She Wears a Smile' and \\\"Paint Me a Picture' \u2010 that the band expended just as much sweat and passion in the studio as they do night after night onstage. Time was when the idea of a band honing its craft and reputation one show at a time was the rule rather than the exception, but in this era of American Idol insta\u2010stars and overnight hipster blog sensations, Tyler and the Northern Lights are a throwback in the best sense of the word. The core lineup of lead singer, guitarist Jonathan Tyler, guitarist Brandon Pinckard, drummer Jordan Cain and bassist Nick Jay may have only made its public debut at the dawn of 2007, but the ensuing three years have been a blur of full\u2010tilt rock 'n' roll showmanship worthy of prime James Brown and the early Rolling Stones or the E Street Band at their hungriest. The inspired addition of singer Mo Brown to the fold early on pushes the sass and swagger needle into the red, with a supporting cast of horn and organ players on deck when whim or venue calls for even more firepower. But no matter how many people are onstage, the exhilarating energy is the same. And that goes for whether the band's playing it in front of a few dozen strangers in a bar, a few hundred diehard fans in a packed club or arena crowds in the thousands while opening for heavyweights like AC/DC, Kid Rock, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Deep Purple and even fellow Dallas maverick Erykah Badu.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best shows, enthuses Tyler, are those where the band and audience become one. And it happens a lot more often that not, even at massive gigs like the Austin City Limits Music Festival. \\\"To be honest, I try to make every show like that,' says the 24\u2010year\u2010old singer, who can play a mean lick but happily shares lead guitar duties with Pinckard \u2010 freeing him to work crowds up into a wild frenzy. \\\"I see my role as being less of a rock star \u2010 like, 'I'm up here, look at me!' \u2010 and more like we're all in the same place, hanging out together and having a party, and the band's just driving the car. At the end of the day, you are entertaining people, but I've tried from the beginning to be really uninhibited and free. The idea is letting everything be exactly what it is \u2010 not trying to control the show, not trying to control yourself, but rather, letting yourself be out of control. That's what makes it great.'\\r\\n\\r\\nLearning to be out of control was more than just a revelation for Tyler and the rest of the band \u2010 it was their genesis. The friendships in the group actually go a lot farther back than 2007. Tyler moved to Dallas from Birmingham, Alabama when he was 16, three years after teaching himself guitar via a Slash (Guns 'N Roses) guitar book and obsessive studying of Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix, Robert Johnson and even Metallica. It was in the Big D that he met Texas native Pinckard and soon after, Oklahoma transplants Cain and Jay. Together they played the local all\u2010ages circuit and even generated a smattering of label interest. Problem was, they were all too young and inexperienced to have much of anything to say. \\\"We just hadn't lived yet, you know?' Tyler says with a laugh. \\\"It was just a bunch suburban middle\u2010class kids trying really hard, but not having any substance because we didn't have any problems yet. I didn't have anything to write about.' So they pulled the plug and split up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We played until we were about 20, and that's when we discovered booze and drugs, and we quit. Just basically started experimenting with everything. I'm not trying to glamorize any of it, but we went from pure as driven snow to really into some really crazy stuff. It was a real wake up call when one of my closest friends was lost to an overdose.'\\r\\nFortunately, Tyler maintained just enough control during that time to keep writing, channeling all of those eye\u2010opening (and frequently harrowing) new life experiences into songs that he started performing solo acoustic from any stage or street corner he could find. In stark contrast to his earlier songs, these postcards from the edge had teeth and hard\u2010 earned soul to them, and it wasn't long before he'd gained enough traction to warrant hitting the studio. With a band. So he rounded up his old friends, all of whom had lived just as hard and wild as he had over their year apart, and the slightly older but much more torn and frayed gang knocked out their independent debut, Hot Trottin', in five days. They had no idea what they were doing, but this much was certain: The second time around, everything about the music they were playing felt real. And it only got more so once they took their new songs on the road. Crowds, critics, fellow musicians and music industry scouts all seemed to agree, too. Within a year, they were showcasing for virtually every major label in America, winning fans like Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes and racking up glowing reviews across the country.\\r\\nBut when they signed to Atlantic's F\u2010Stop Music in late 2008, Tyler wanted to do more than just bottle that thunder and lightning on disc for the band's major\u2010label debut. He wanted to make sure that the songs \u2010 all born on acoustic guitar \u2010 maintained that close\u2010to\u2010the\u2010bone integrity that spawned the whole wild ride in the first place. The band was introduced to a half\u2010dozen different producers before finding the perfect fit in Joyce \u2010 a name Tyler threw into the hat himself. A guitarist, songwriter and producer whose studio credits span everything from modern garage rock (Cage the Elephant) to mainstream country (Jack Ingram), Joyce was Tyler's pick first and foremost because of his penchant for working with great songwriters, most notably John Hiatt and Patty Griffin. \\\"There's usually two schools of thought in the studio:\\r\\nthere's guys who are really good at getting sounds, and there's guys who are really good at getting better songs,' says Tyler, \\\"but I wanted both of those. Jay was a guy who could do all around anything, so going with him was a no\u2010brainer for me. I really wanted to find a producer who would be like another person in the group, who would sit down with us and we'd all go, 'OK, let's listen to this song on acoustic guitar, and then work on making it better from there.' Because songwriting, to me, that's the most important part.'\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter you've got the songwriting down, well, that's when you just let go and let the spirit of the performance and moment take over, and follow it wherever it takes you \u2010 right up to and over the edge. The only rule \u2010 and, looking back to band members' own pre\u2010rock\u2010'n'\u2010roll\u2010wake\u2010up\u2010call days, it's one they've all learned from experience \u2010 is that the songs must always be 100\u2010proof real.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The bottom line is, we love playing music and making music, but we want to have a clear conscience about everything we're doing,' insists Tyler. \\\"Music can bring out a lot of your soul, it can bring out deep parts of you, but I can't write songs or sing songs or do any of it if any part of it feels contrived. I don't know what's going to happen next, but we're happy with what's happening now, being able to live the way we are. I can only hope our music moves people as deeply as it moved us in making it.\\\"\\r\\nAnd so it begins. The story of Jonathan Tyler & The Northern Lights has yet to be written, but it is sure to be a page\u2010 turner and one\u2010hell\u2010of\u2010a wild ride.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1559},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":487},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":325},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-og.jpg\",\"width\":1261,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":162},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":493,\"height\":800},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":1055},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/69/69-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.jonathantylermusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/jonathantylermusic\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/JonathanTylerMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/jonathan_tyler\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"jonathan_tyler\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1708325,\"name\":\"Elise Davis\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Vulnerability and carnal desire go head-to-head on Elise Davis' The Token releasing September 9 on Make The Kill Records & Thirty Tigers.\\n\\nStory and storyteller are one and the same. \\\"I really can't express my vulnerable feelings \u2013 especially towards men I've had feelings about over the years,\\\" Elise confesses, \\\"But, I have no trouble writing down painfully honest lyrics about it.\\\"\\n\\nThe Token puts a microscope on the southern dynamic between the sexes, and the Little Rock, AR native's inner turmoil, founded on her life's trajectory against a more traditional path.
