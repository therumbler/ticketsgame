Perhaps one of the big clich\u00e9s, but unusually evident when it comes to In Flames and their new album \\\"Siren Charms\\\". To lose one of the musical engines of a band usually means a ticket to the graveyard of bands for an eternal rest among abandoned careers and reasonably forgotten last albums. Sure, history has proven the opposite once or twice - but one could question if anyone has risen from the ashes with such strength and power as In Flames? When guitarist Jesper Str\u00f6mblad left the band following 2008's \\\"A Sense  of  Purpose\\\",  the  harbingers  of  doom  were  very  vocal  on  the  imminent  collapse  of  the Gothenburg band. That never happened. In what must be described as a pure backlash, the band delivered it's strongest album to date \u2013 \\\"Sounds of a Playground Fading\\\" - which was both awarded for gold-level sales and topped charts in both Sweden and Germany. \\\"Siren Charms\\\", the first album with Niclas Engelin as permanent guitarist in the band, cements the greatness hinted at with the previous album; this is a band taking it's game several steps forward, leaving both imitators and nay-sayers far behind. The first sign that the band have taken a different route is the choice of studio. Where they previously have  recorded  at  home  in  Gothenburg,  the  whole  operation  was  now  moved  to  Berlin  and  the legendary Hansa Ton Studios. At the K\u00f6thener Strasse-location, artists like Iggy Pop, David Bowie, U2 and  Killing Joke have all  recorded some of rock history's most spoken of classics, and it  is no \\nexaggeration to say that history can be felt in the walls. Here, the band settled in with producer Roberto Laghi and vocal producer Daniel Bergstrand. Based at Hansa since a few years is also swedish mix-engineer Michael Ilbert, who was appointed to mix the album after keyboard-wizard \u00d6rjan \u00d6rnkloo once again contributed  with his characteristic programming and synthesizers. Both guitars Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte and vocalist Anders Frid\u00e9n are convinced that the choice of environment has had an influence on the final results. All details, big and small, interconnect and have given the eleven newsongs a darker sound and tone. A darkness and sadness in the music's atmosphere that anyone who has wandered home drunk through a rainy Kreuzberg at four in the morning can recognize. If  \\\"Sounds  of  a  Playground  fading\\\"  took  more  than  three  months  to  complete,  the  band  gave themselves six weeks to record \\\"Siren Charms\\\". They brought \\\"a bag of riffs\\\" and a hand full of song structures to start off. The method meant a self-inflicted pressure to feed creativity and was a daring move. It also meant that Anders Frid\u00e9n and Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte got to collaborate in a new way as song-writers. Previously, Bj\u00f6rns love of classic rock and Frid\u00e9ns wish to experiment resulted in clashes with both parties claiming \\\"You ought to think like this... No, YOU ought to think like THIS!\\\". With the limited time in the studio, they instead had to embrace each others different approaches and turn them to strengths. Daniel Svensson, drummer of In Flames, got demos of the songs with simple programmed drums, and could then add his personal touch to the sessions. Given the intricate and highly intense drumming on the album, one would easily guess that he'd been playing the songs for months, but it is often first-take recordings delivered with laser-sharp precision. Frid\u00e9n and Gelotte can't give him enough praise, claiming him to be one of the world's best drummers who doesn't make too much fuss around his drumming  (\\\"He  doesn't  go  around  doing  drum-glove  endorsements  really\\\"),  but  always  delivers flawless takes in the studio and on stage. Together with bass player Peter Iwers, they create a foundation for the music so solid you could build Burj Khalifa on it. Frid\u00e9n had to pay a high price for the heavy time pressure and creative stress. On his return to Sweden, his body caved in and he found himself physically and mentally exhausted. Straight after the album sessions were finished, work at his own label Razzia Notes started without any chance of recuperation  and recharging of the batteries. His attitude  of \\\"I've  always done this - toured and recorded\\\" finally took it's toll and he found himself knocked out at home. When Anders talks about thecrash today with some distance, he can see the experience as healthy; the insight that one has to listen to the bodies signals and shut down for a while. Above all, he's content with the knowledge that he's taken the new recordings as far as is physically possible. The result being an album showcasing exactly where In Flames are 2014. One of the biggest differences from previous albums comes from Frid\u00e9n as well. Where he used to mix his vocals with both screaming and growls, \\\"Siren Charms\\\" is more or less completely fragile and delicate when it comes to the vocal delivery. It is the result of a vocalist with no holds barred, bearing his throat and letting the listener come closer than ever before. It's intimate, emotional and powerful. \\nThe album title refers to the female creatures from the Greek mythology who lured sailors with their singing, only to watch their ships crush against the cliffs and sink. A story that is told in different ways over  the  albums  lyrics  and  is  applicable  to  the  many  aspects  of  the  human  need  to  intoxicate ourselves, and submit to seduction. They are fascinating tales of what we are prepared to sacrifice toachieve those states of mind. \\\"Siren Charms\\\" secures In Flames position as a metal band that never stands still, and it is doubtlessly a band that continues to take risks, push boundaries and challenge themselves as much as their audience. That the adversities haven't killed the band is quite obvious - but the question is if In Flames have ever been this strong?\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":704,\"height\":1024},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":436},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":291},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-og.jpg\",\"width\":704,\"height\":1024},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":145},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":727},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":945},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/45-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.inflames.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/inflames\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/inflames\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/InFlames_SWE\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"InFlames_SWE\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1459451,\"name\":\"From Ashes to New\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Lancaster, Pennsylvania is the sort of town of which there are many hundred all across America: post-industrial, blue collar and, on occasion, more than a little bleak. As is so often the case though, it is in these relative backwards towns that authentic, compelling creativity truly thrives - the monotony of the landscape punctuated by brilliant flares of art. FROM ASHES TO NEW are one such flare; a thoroughly modern rock band wielding both a state-of-the-art sound and an old-as-the-hills work ethic. \\n\\nFormed barely two years ago by vocalist, programmer and creative mastermind Matt Brandyberry, the sextet consists of the cream of Lancaster's underground scene. \\\"We have all played with each other in old bands and other projects,\\\" explains Brandyberry. \\\"And when those things stalled or fell apart, the guys who wanted to take things a little more seriously began to gravitate toward FATN. It all came together incredibly organically and we clicked almost instantaneously. It was a real 'Aha!' moment, like this was the band we should have been in all along.\\\"\\n\\nFor Brandyberry in particular, FATN represents a creative endeavor a long time in the making. As a young kid obsessed by world-changing flows of Tupac and Biggie as well as the local Philadelphia Hip Hop scene that surrounded him, writing rhymes became a natural pastime. \\\"It was until my late teens that my interest in hard rock music properly developed,\\\" explains the frontman \\\"slowly but surely I got into things like Sevendust and it all snowballed from there.\\\"\\n\\nBefore long, Brandyberry was obsessively playing guitar and piano and, most importantly, penning his own music to go with the raps he had been developing since junior high. \\\"I decided I was going to put everything I had inside of me into doing music, it became everything to me. I was like a sponge - I wanted to learn every technique, every skill so that I had what I needed to out the ideas that I had in my head on paper and eventually turn them into records.\\\"\\n\\nAnd turn those ideas into records is exactly what he did. With the assistance of producer Grant McFarland, FATN set about molding their rap/rock hybrid into a sky-scrapingly monolithic proposition. \\n\\n\\\"We always wanted our songs to sound huge,\\\" admits co-vocalist and melodic linchpin Chris Musser. \\\"Our ambition is to throw as much as we can into them and give the listener the most connecting experience possible. We vent a lot of emotion, a lot of frustrations, a lot of angst through our songs, but we always want them to have a craft to them - something which shines through.\\\"\\n\\nAnd if recent four-track EP Downfall was a glistening opening gambit, then the forthcoming full-length album will radiate with the fire of a thousand suns. A fearsome mix of contemporary metalcore crunch and soul-searching rap, the band are already punching with a heavyweight strength that belies their so far brief career. It's a potent approach galvanized further by the background from which the band all come from. \\n\\n\\\"When we were recording the album, we were all holding down full time jobs,\\\" explains Musser. \\\"I work fixing up body panels for airplanes. I'd start work at 6, finish at 4 then go straight to the studio to work until 2 in the morning. That has been my life for the past year and the discontentment of working in a dead-end job has filtered through onto this album massively. We go through the same things that everyone else who has to wake up in the morning and go do something they hate.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To put it bluntly, there's a lot of 'Fuck you' on this album,\\\" laughs Brandyberry. \\\"A lot of stuff about shitty relationships, about working hard for something and people telling you can't do it, about never accepting that things are just 'beyond you'. We're not the cool band from LA or New York or any of those places, we're six regular guys from a regular place but that is in our favor, not against us. We understand what it's like.\\\"\\n\\nYet with major tours with the likes of Hollywood Undead under their belts,and a record deal that puts them among some of the best known commercial rock bands already signed, FATN look set to take their message to a bigger stage than they could ever previously have imagined. \\n\\nBlessed with honesty, integrity, grit, determination and, most vitally, a genuinely devastating arsenal of gut-mangling tunes \u2013 FROM ASHES TO NEW have got all the ingredients to turn your world, and the entire scene, on its head.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.fromashestonew.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/FromAshesToNew\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/FromAshestoNew\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"FromAshestoNew\"},{\"id\":1709569,\"name\":\"The Source\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-og.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/50/47-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":170}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/thesourceband\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1316321?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
