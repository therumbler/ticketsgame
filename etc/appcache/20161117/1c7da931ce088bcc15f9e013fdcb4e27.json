The band has released the first song \\\"Nightlife\\\" today, which can be streamed via YouTube. Fans are invited to pre-order the album starting today by going to www.owthstore.com.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Bill Stevenson of Decendents fame at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, CO, Home retains all the boisterous spirit of the band's earlier efforts while sonically taking a monumental step forward. The new album embraces authentic punk rock at its core and combines melodic fast paced aggression with mid-tempo pop, while singer Ryan Young's rough and edgy vocals and genuine lyrics create a sincerity that can only come from a hard working band that lives and breathes it every day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Home is about the struggles of constantly being on the move, trying to maintain relationships while being away, and not feeling like there is really anywhere to go home to anymore,\\\" says Young. It's about the reasons why people leave their hometowns and never go back.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first track, \\\"Star Walking\\\", an explosive opener about things getting worse while waiting for things to get better, to the album's first single \\\"Nightlife\\\" about worry-filled, sleepless nights that keep you awake, Young describes the new album as \\\"being about how hard it is to accept change for some of us.\\\" This is evident in the sobering track \\\"Stolen Away\\\" that takes a hard look at fleeting relationships while \\\"Seek Advice Elsewhere\\\" touches upon the importance of reflection. Young continues to say, \\\"It's about getting older, and not being ok with it. It is about how religion can destroy a family. Finally, it is a dedication to anyone who can relate.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOff With Their Heads have begun to carve out their own foundation in punk rock history with their very own take on rowdy, self-deprecating, beer-drinking, working class punk rock. When it comes to touring virtually year round, it isn't a choice as much as it's a lifestyle for Off With Their Heads. In March, the band will once again head out on another tour in anticipation of one of the year's most engaging punk rock records.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":638},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":680},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":332},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":332},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":432},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/69/67/75-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":432}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/offwiththeirheads\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/owth42069\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1723531,\"name\":\"Brendan Kelly\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Brendan Kelly (born September 8, 1976) is the bassist/vocalist of Chicago-based punk band The Lawrence Arms, as well as guitarist/lead vocalist in The Falcon. Kelly's former bands include Slapstick and The Broadways. He is known for his raspy vocals, drunken demeanor, and onstage witticisms.\\n\\nKelly also appeared on The Daily Show in a correspondent piece by Ed Helms entitled \\\"The Clash\\\" in which he criticized Michale Graves for being a Republican.\\n\\nHe attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois and graduated in 2000 with a Bachelor's Degree in Radio, Television, and Film.\\n\\nHe is a fan of country music, explaining styles of songs such as \\\"Old Mexico Way\\\" and \\\"Warped Summer Extravaganza (Major Excellent)\\\" in The Lawrence Arms, as well as \\\"R.L. Burnouts Inc.\\\" in The Falcon.\\n\\nKelly boycotts the Warped Tour on the belief that it ruins the original system for underground bands of touring and supporting larger bands, as well as ruining business for small venues. He along with The Lawrence Arms were banned for life for spreading this belief to the audience whilst participating in the Warped Tour.\\n\\nKelly provided backup vocals for the songs \\\"The Company,\\\" \\\"Stuck In Summertime\\\" and \\\"Unsatisfied\\\" on The Copyrights' third full-length album, 2007's Make Sound released on Red Scare Industries, a label owned and operated by Tobias Jeg, a close friend of Kelly. Kelly (along with Chris McCaughan) also provided back-up vocals on Common Rider's 'This is Unity Music' album.\\n\\nIn 2010, Brendan released a split album with Joe McMahon of the punk rock band Smoke or Fire, entitled Wasted Potential. Brendan's half of the split contained acoustic versions of Lawrence Arms songs, as well as a cover of \\\"Kiss the Bottle\\\" by Jawbreaker.\\n\\nDuring the periods of inactivity of his musical projects, Brendan has been joined by fellow punk rock singers Tom Gabel and Brian Fallon in maintaining a blog, Bad Sandwich Chronicles. The blog is a mixture of scatological humor, social commentary, and stories of life in music. Kelly also co-hosts iconic music television program JBTV in Chicago.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":444,\"height\":319},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":444,\"height\":319},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":216},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":144},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-og.png\",\"width\":444,\"height\":319},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":72},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atxl.png\",\"width\":444,\"height\":319},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atxl1.png\",\"width\":444,\"height\":319},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atxxl.png\",\"width\":444,\"height\":319},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/39/03-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":444,\"height\":319}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Kelly_(musician)\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/thelawrencearms\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":515861,\"name\":\"This Obsession\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Chicago's punk trio, This Obsession, began in the Summer of 09'. The band consists of Mark on guitar/vocals. Jess on bass/backing vocals, and Jon on the drums. Since starting the band, the three-piece has put time into making success out of what they have created, not giving up, and moving forward with what they can do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Nowerdays it's hard to find a serious local band. When you're young, you're always stuck in the high school scene, but now we've managed to get out of it and take our music a step further. We just recorded a 6 track EP, and shelled out cash to professionally package them, and are booking shows in actual venues in Chicago. We love this band to death, and want to make it a big deal. It's not about money, or fame, because if it was, we all would have done something stupid to make news worthy headlines. Trust me, I would at least. Jess is too nice. (Laughs). We just want to meet new people all over the world and travel with our music and spread it. It's the coolest job and that's what our goals are. We're pushing for it and will NEVER stop.\\\" says Mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecording the new EP started in January, and was finally released on May 21st, 2011. This Obsession hired Vincent Ippolito of SRS Recordings to produce their first record, which required months of hard work and lots of planning. The EP is self-titled and consists of 6 songs such as \\\"Raccoon Flying Over Summer\\\",\\\"The Girl That I Work With\\\", and \\\"My Chevy Impala\\\". \\\"It is by far the best recording we have done so far with sound and effort.\\\" says Mark. The frontman continued to speak saying \\\"Vince, who did our record was really hardcore about the whole process. It all had to be done a certain way. We had to lay out all the drum tracks, and then bass tracks, followed by guitar, double it, and then vocals and what not. Each instrument recording took days to complete. If it wasn't done right, it's not getting finished then until we are ALL satisfied, and Vince made sure of that\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter going through rough demos that were released only over the internet, the Chicago punk trio can finally say they are satisfied with the new recordings. The self titled EP is now sold for $5.
