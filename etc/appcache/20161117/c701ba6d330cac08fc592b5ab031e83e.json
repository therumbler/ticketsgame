Old Crow Medicine Show with three-part harmonies. The Band for millennials\u2026 The Maine-grown, foot-stompin\u2019 holler-folk quartet create the type of music for which festivals are made.\u201d - The Boston Globe\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn on the banks of the Saco River, brothers in all but name, the Ghost of Paul Revere is Maine's holler-folk band. A powerful, energetic, non-traditional American folk band that\u2019s renowned for harmony fueled, heart-pounding performances full of songs with unique identities that remain undeniably the Ghost of Paul Revere. \\r\\n    Formed around childhood friends Max Davis, Sean McCarthy, and Griffin Sherry, joined by Matt Young on harmonica, the Ghost of Paul Revere played their first show together in 2011 at a tiny bar in Portland, Maine. Now, they play across the nation, bringing holler-folk into houses, bars, and music halls. They have shared the stage with the Avett Brothers, The Travelin\u2019 McCourys, Brown Bird, Spirit Family Reunion, Darlingside, as well as members of Greensky Bluegrass, the Infamous Stringdusters, and Old Crow Medicine Show.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir critically acclaimed, Billboard charting full length album Believe, as well as their two EPs North and Field Notes Vol. 1, have continually been the top selling local albums in Maine and New Hampshire for more than four years. The Ghost of Paul Revere has since sold out Port City Music Hall, Stone Mountain Arts Center, and the Strand Theater multiple times, won Best In Maine at the 2014 New England Music Awards, were an official showcase artist at Folk Alliance International 2015 and made their Newport Folk Festival debut in August 2015. They capped off 2015 with an electrifying headline performance on New Year's eve at Portland's State Theatre in front of 1,600 enraptured fans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, amidst touring nationally, they returned to the studio to craft their second full length album, engineered by Jonathan Wyman at Halo Studios and mastered by Adam Ayan of Gateway Mastering.  The album is expected to be released in early 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Robustly played, masterful amalgamation of bluegrass, folk, and gospel for the Millennial Generation... The Ghost of Paul Revere prove that superior roots music can come from anywhere.\\\" - No Depression\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Simply put, this band is one to see live... A gorgeous blend of bluegrass, folk and good old fashioned rock and roll... their performance takes on a boot-clacking brilliance that transforms each song into a full-on participatory event, sending an electric surge about the room that\u2019s near impossible not to feel. Add to that a layered three part harmony coursing through each soulful song, and The Ghost of Paul Revere demonstrated they not only had the chops, but the heart to reach their audience and leave an undeniable impression as well. As the floorboards shook with each pounding stomp, one thing was certain: the band announced they had arrived, loud and clear.\\\" - Dispatch Magazine\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Simply put North is an album that shouldn't be missed. (It will) make even the most callous of individuals feel the unbridled joy of Holler-Folk.\\\" - Ear to the Ground Music\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"A distinguished sound that only seasoned musicians can usually attain\\\" - Portland Press Herald\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"(The Ghost of Paul Revere) stole the show. I was so impressed with them. Their harmonies, stomping percussion, and vocal power were stellar... their songs progressed from mellow to powerhouse... their harmonies are superb and their songs have power.\\\" - whatbreesees.com\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":639},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-og.jpg\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":666},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/58/57-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Xp3L02Joj8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.ghostofpaulrevere.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/ghostofpaulrevere\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/NorthernGhosts\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"NorthernGhosts\"},{\"id\":1003407,\"name\":\"Christian Lopez Trio\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Steeped in the musical roots of his West Virginia upbringing, Christian Lopez epitomizes the soul of a traditional Appalachian folk musician living in the heart, mind and body of a man not yet even 21 years old.  On his debut full-length effort, Onward, the young artist emulates the sound produced by the region\u2019s resident pickers and strummers and tackles themes of love, perseverance and coming of age.\\r\\n\\r\\nReleased in May 2015, Onward was produced by Grammy Award-winner Dave Cobb (Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson) at his Nashville-based Low Country Sound studio.  \u201cI love[d] working with Christian,\u201d Cobb recently told Native Magazine.  \\\"It was kind of a no-brainer because Christian\u2019s such a talent, and completely natural.  I think he has a bit of Paul Simon in him.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ardent fan of both classic and contemporary artists from across the spectrum of rock, country and pop, Lopez never struggled with the direction his own music would take.  \u201cI've been most influenced by artists and bands that pushed through the barrier of what was popular to create the music they loved,\u201d Lopez relates. \u201cMy goal was to do the same, and Dave was the perfect producer for the job.  He makes music in such a raw, genuine way, and his production cuts straight to the bone.  He understood exactly what I was going for, and I understood him.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Lopez, Onward is about the responsibilities and sacrifices that come with the pursuit of something you are driven to do. It\u2019s about the yearning to put down roots, but being hopelessly addicted to the wanderlust of the road, seeking to escape the day-to-day for the promise of what tomorrow may bring.  And be it the lyrical folk-rock of \u201cTake You Away\u201d and \u201cThe Man I Was Before,\u201d the pedal steel-laced classic country strains of \u201cMorning Rise\u201d or the neo-Americana jangle of \u201cDon\u2019t Know How,\u201d Lopez\u2019s melding of influences into a sound identifiably his own throughout ONWARD is impressive. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince the album\u2019s release, Lopez and Onward have steadily garnered praise and attention in the media.  Rolling Stone Country proclaimed him \u201cBest Newcomer\u201d at Americana Music Fest in Nashville in the fall of 2015, noting that Lopez \u201cpacked so much kinetic energy into his set, and sliced so many strings, that he had to finish on a borrowed guitar,\u201d and concluding \u201c\u2026at his best, he's a maker of smart and slick country that holds a whole lot of promise and age-appropriate fun without pandering to any radio trends.\u201d  The outlet then later premiered a special live acoustic performance video of \u201cStay With You\u201d in January of 2016. \\r\\n\\r\\nLopez also took to the nationally-syndicated public radio airwaves last fall, performing on the acclaimed, long-running NPR show Mountain Stage and later on the highly-regarded Music City Roots.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf Onward, American Songwriter wrote that \u201cit\u2019s easy to see that Christian Lopez has a rich career ahead of him\u2026[an] impressive first effort\u201d while Stereo Subversion remarked that \u201cit\u2019s Lopez\u2019s acoustic guitar and his soulful voice that pulls deeply on the heartstrings and shines brightest. \u2026In a noisy realm of new bands and artists, Lopez could be a standout just based on his songwriting ability alone.\u201d  Alternate Root named Lopez one of its Top 25 artists in 2015, noted \u201cThere are guys twice Lopez\u2019s age making records that are only half as good. Preternaturally wise and notably talented, this is a kid to watch.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nRaised in the small town of Martinsburg in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia, Lopez has been playing piano since he was five (introduced to it by his music teacher mom, a lover of opera and classical music) and guitar since the age of six, eventually playing in several local bands along the way before finally emerging to center stage to perform his own songs as the Christian Lopez Band.  In 2014, Lopez would be declared the winner of the Belk Modern Music Showcase at The Fillmore in Charlotte, NC after performing \u201cWill I See You Again,\u201d a song that he would later record for his debut EP, Pilot, and would also be included on Onward.  The Belk award would also land the Christian Lopez Band on the retailer\u2019s summer tour, which included dates at shows for both the Zac Brown Band and the Dave Matthews Band. \\r\\n\\r\\nTouring incessantly since the release of Onward, Lopez and his band have most recently opened dates for American Aquarium, The Black Lillies, John Fullbright, Marty Stuart, Miranda Lambert, Sister Hazel, Steve Forbert, and Corey Smith.  \u201cI love touring.  Not only does it make us a better band, it also makes us better people.  We learn to connect with new fans, we experience new places, and appreciate the little things we miss and love when we're gone.  I believe all of that will ultimately make me a better songwriter.  Which leads me to my next point: Record #2 is in the works.  We've got so much to share.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":959,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-og.jpg\",\"width\":959,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":501},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":651},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/59/32-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"AZ7FPg4-Q4I\",\"title\":\"\\\"Living of Love\\\" - Christian Lopez - Avett Brothers (COVER)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZ7FPg4-Q4I\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZ7FPg4-Q4I\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.christianlopezband.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Christianlopezband?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/clopezmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"clopezmusic\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.jamminjava.com/event/1374161?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
