Hiss\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"It\u2019s dark outside our window, with thunder echoing over the horizon \u2014 a familiar rumble, but we can\u2019t tell where it\u2019s headed. Does this mean Purling Hiss are coming back our way? Among other things, YES. High Bias is in the air.There\u2019s no place like America today \u2014 but that\u2019s been true of our lunatic colony for a long time. Purling Hiss have floated through the sewer of US culture their whole lives. Growing up in a time like the 80s made a professional dreamer out of Mike Polizze, fueling a desire to escape to the perfect world where music amplifies the pain or just plain DROWNS IT OUT. Since 2009, the fuzzing rock power of Purling Hiss has taken many different forms, all emanating from of Polizze\u2019s instinctive approach to playing guitar, writing songs and hooking a feeling from disparate memories, sensations and desired effects. At times car oefree and apparently footloose in the world, other times intensely focused and wrathful, Purling Hiss are the orphaned kids of last century\u2019s rock and roll generations, lost in a society that has forgotten its way but determined to find their feet again. High Bias moves with rageful, dazed humor and soulfulness against the darkening times in which we find ourselves. With no way out, Purling Hiss hit today\u2019s bullshit head-on, employing pounding psych-rock and punk effects, slipping signature Hissian backup \u201coooo- ooh\u201ds and Polizze\u2019s blistering guitar pile-ups in a full-bodied, head-ripping brew.\\r\\n\\r\\nMike puts together a Purling Hiss album as a whole thing, with songs striking defiant and wistful tones in turn, mixing in odes to impermanence, spitefilled rebellion and bemused recollections along the way. High Bias kicks off at 11, blowing with first take energy into a mood of ominous portent. Right away, the power of the band all together is sick \u2014 the guys that came on for Weirdon have grown into a full-fledged Purling Hiss, with Ben and Dan feeding off each other, providing fresh rhythm ground for the songs to romp over. This creates seamless motion between disparate styles, from streamlined futurist radiowave to blatzing punk, sweet indie-pop song craft and barely-contained group riffage. Side one closes with \u201cTeddy\u2019s Servo Motors,\u201d a Milk-Carton Kids/Teddy Ruxpin-haunted fever dream. This was the volcanic headwater of High Bias, a post-tour jam after the end of the Weirdon cycle that pointed the way toa new combination of pop and trash fully loaded with favorite reference points and forgotten ephemera from former eras.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the album, Purling Hiss modulate styles and inspirations, drawing influence from different eras of rock, treasuring bubblegummy moments (like the incredibly sweet \u201cFollow You Around\u201d and the cheeky \u201cGet Your Way\u201d), and mix-and-matching nostalgia for punk, dance-pop, no-wave and krautrock, all of it melted down into a pleasingly primitive jet of tunage to spray into today. Album closer \u201cEverybody in the USA\u201d brings Purling Hiss full-circle to the repetitive stomp and antisocial fear and loathing found in early recordings, while recalling a misread 80s protest number whose anthemic chorus was used for propaganda despite everything said in the verses. This is the scourge of our American life \u2014 the manipulation and the misuse of the desires of people living their everyday lives \u2014 but Purling Hiss don\u2019t shy away from being misheard, that\u2019s a part of the confusion we\u2019re all a part of.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh Bias is a brave and bold blast of popular music that lays it on the line to keep the rebellion alive in the streets of our mind. This is rock we will need in our ears as we venture into the darkness, and the next unexplored stretch of the wasteland....\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":726},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":227},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":151},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-og.jpg\",\"width\":2000,\"height\":1512},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":76},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":378},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":491},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/74/25-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/purlinghiss\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/PurlingHiss\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/PurlingHiss\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"PurlingHiss\"},{\"id\":372623,\"name\":\"AXIS:SOVA\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Axis: Sova\u2019s recently released Early Surf is a blown-out, sure-as-shootin\u2019 guitar symposium of an album via Ty Segall's God?

Instead of describing sounds, genres often connect to fashion movements (punk), derogatory journalistic slogans (shoegaze, rhythm and blues), or confusing statements about distribution (\\\"commercial pop,\\\" \\\"indie rock\\\"). When we're writing about music, we can insert these types of abstract categories into our work, but they often have the effect of separating an artist's album from their habitat, leaving much unsaid about what we experience when we are listening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Funs provide an exceptional challenge to the music writer. First and foremost, since the band rose through the ranks of Chicago's illegal and underground venues, the simple fact is that experiencing the band's recordings separates the listener from the band's \\\"natural\\\" environment. Secondly, like most independent, outsider pop bands in recent years, The Funs' music is really without genre. You could call them a punk band, but that's not quite right \u2013 their songs are often chugging, slow, and tempo-shifting. Yet, the band isn't really noisy or crazy, either \u2014 they don't mash effects pedals, they don't play with signal noise, they don't manipulate tape, etc. And, as muddy the band might sound, this certainly isn't what you'd recognize as grunge. So you see, we have a full gamut of ill-fitting categories for The Funs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seemingly omnipresent Manic Static released The Funs' self-titled d\u00e9but on cassette in 2012, and the limited edition vinyl version has hit the streets just in time for summer 2013. Throughout this album the duo streamlines their arrangements to the barest of elements. There's hardly a fuzz pedal on this one, as a guitar and booming drums propel each hazy song into its neighbor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've never seen The Funs live. Beyond their song-writing and recording aesthetic, that seems to be the most relevant fact of my review, so it is biased from the outset. I can crank my stereo as loud as possible, dump out all the beer I own onto the floor, and roll around in dirty laundry, and I still won't be able to accurately report the feeling of this band. There's a disconnect between reports about their shows and their recordings \u2014 this isn't a bad thing, it's simply a matter of whether or not one has the necessary trappings to enable them to touch the music. How does one appreciate party music outside of a party?\\r\\n\\r\\nMidrange celebrations abound on The Funs. Aside from any genre signifier, the sound of the band falls squarely into the middle of the sonic spectrum. One might say that the recording is lo-fidelity, but that's not really true: individual elements are perfectly clear, it is simply that their range converges. For example, this influences the guitars, which sound clean enough taken on their own terms but bleed together with the drums so profusely as to form a heavy layer of sonic grit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout crazy effects or tape manipulation, Jessee Rose Crane and Philip Jerome Lesicko use tempo shifts and dynamic responses between their guitars and drums to build textures and accompany their chugging chord structures. On \\\"Reality,\\\" the outcome of a slithering arpeggio is dirty hypnosis, and steady, thwacking drums on \\\"Dead Days\\\" slice right through a jangling chord sequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether pieced or sequenced together, The Funs reaches a level of intensity through its changes of pace. \\\"Moon\\\" is strangely similar to \\\"Dead Days,\\\" for example, but after the slower \\\"Dead Days,\\\" The Funs immediately kick- start a series of blissful, driving sequences to build the plot of the release. Abrupt stops or endpoints characterize the songs: suddenly, \\\"Moon\\\" just ends, there is a palpable silence\u2026 then \\\"Memory\\\" resumes at an even slower pace. Back and forth, these changes become entrancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, pop music endures through the beauty and power of its experiences. The Funs' d\u00e9but ultimately supports the argument against genres and classification, instead preferring straightforward statements. If you've seen The Funs live, this review probably does little justice to their approach to pop music; if you're like me and you can't see them live, their recordings showcase simple sounds suitable for basements, bars, and illegal venues. From their midrange haze, the group hypnotizes their listener while hiding nothing in their sleeves.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":712},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":223},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":148},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1519},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":74},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":371},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":482},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/65/03/51-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://MANICSTATIC.COM/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Funs\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.hideoutchicago.com/event/1323655?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
