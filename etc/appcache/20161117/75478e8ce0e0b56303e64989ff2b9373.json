as volatile as it sounds, the actual dictionary term for \\\"radioactive\\\" leaves a lot to the imagination. But just as he does with every word he spits, Ghet-O-Vision/Shady recording artist Yelawolf gives it new life and meaning. Making it a fitting title for his official debut album.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I think its a perfect word to describe where I'm going,\\\" says the Alabama born rapper. \\\"It's the fallout, the aftermath of everything I've been through and here's what's left. This radioactive material.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a life story that no book could contain, the artist born Michael Atha could have auditioned for the \\\"most interesting man in the world\\\" title. Geograpically, he was born in a state that rests between Mississippi and Georgia but mentally he was raised in a state of constant change. Bouncing around between Alabama and Tennessee as a child, Wolf's upbringing exposed him to the impoverished realities of both White America's trailer parks and Black America's ghettos.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duality would finally define itself on a fateful evening where his mother was playing host to a group of friends who happened to be the roadie crew for rapstars Run DMC. It was that night where Wolf, who was raised on a healthy dosage of Southern Rock, would hear songs like \\\"My Adidas\\\" and Beastie Boys \\\"Paul Revere\\\" for the first time. From that point on he knew that Hip Hop was now in his DNA. Unfortunately up to this point Wolf had to battle Hip Hop listeners who judged by outside appearance...but he's winning that fight now.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter years of toiling in the rap chitlin circuit, the mixtape matrix and doing hooks for a spectrum of artists ranging from Juelz Santana to Slim Thug, Wolf broke out in grand fashion with his critically acclaimed independent release Trunk Muzik (Ghet-O-Vision Ent.) on New Year's Day 2010. Prideful boasts on songs like \\\"I Wish\\\" (\\\"I wish a motherfucker would tell me that I ain't Hip Hop/Bitch! You ain't Hip Hop!) made listeners look beyond his tattoo-decorated skin and respect his skills. The excitement, paired with his unforgettable live shows, led to numerous magazine covers a record deal through Ghet-O-Vision/Interscope and then a partnership with Shady Records. The label founded by the man who many naysayers opted to unfavorably compare him to, Eminem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"There is a fair comparison between us,\\\" says Wolf. \\\"But the true difference is vocal. The cadence and the words I use. There are words that I can rhyme that he can't just because of my Southern accent. I can go to totally different places because of my slang alone.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wastes no time taking you to these places on Radioactive. With an additional meaning of aspiring to be \\\"active on the radio\\\" the album's first single \\\"Hard White\\\" featuring club music kingpin Lil Jon is a dark, 808-fueled uppercut that shows traces of the 3-6 Mafia influence he picked up while living in Tennessee. Wolf takes it even further on \\\"Throw It Up\\\" featuring former Mafia member Gangsta Boo and Eminem, pulling from both sides of the tracks he was raised on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Juxtaposition is very comforting for me,\\\" he says. \\\"You can't stare at a square, that's boring. But if it's broken, you stare at it longer and try to figure it out. This song is culturally impactful.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith skateboarding being his first love before his affair with Hip Hop, Yelawolf already traveled the country living everywhere between California and New York, crashing on couches and park benches. So when he writes national anthems like \\\"Made In the USA\\\" that pairs lyrics about the dirt with a flowery hook, know that it comes from the perspective of a fly that has been in the dumps, not just on the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The grit and gutters are what I know the most about,\\\" says Wolf who also had a stint as an artic fisherman in Alaska. \\\"I always believed that the people who build the cars, clean the houses, dig the ditches and sell the drugs are the ones who make the world go round. As pretty as the hook is, it's still sarcastic. The melody is great, but I was able to hide a real vocal point behind it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe continues to drive these points home on the tracks \\\"Growing Up In the Gutter\\\" featuring his Slumerican partner in rhyme Rittz and the instant smash \\\"Let's Roll\\\" featuring fellow American badass Kid Rock. Both of which showcase his unique ability to shift gears from Southern Hip Hop to Southern Rock all the while remaining neutral in his own lane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"\\\"I'm one of the most honest artists out there and I've always been this way,\\\" says Wolf in mentioning his crotch-kicking manifesto \\\"No Hands\\\" where he shoots at naysayers and imitators. \\\"It doesn't matter what music I make whether I'm rapping on an 808 or over a guitar. I have a birth right to talk about these things that I do.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRadioactive is also Yelawolf's opportunity to open up and share some of the non-musical experiences that have made him the man and artist he is today.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn \\\"I See You,\\\" a song inspired by a talk with his grandmother, he talks about hitting rock bottom before finally realizing that you had the best in life all along. With \\\"The Hardest Love Song In the World\\\" he stays true to the title admitting that it's two parts difficult writing a \\\"rap ballad,\\\" especially about the special type of woman he likes. Then in the appropriately named \\\"The Last Song\\\" he talks about his rocky relationship with his estranged biological father, for the final time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm not mad at him and I don't have a grudge,\\\" he says. \\\"But I just had to get that off, musically.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThough he's been releasing material since the early 2000's, Radioactive qualifies as Yelawolf's official \\\"debut.\\\" Unlike his prior efforts that were recorded in basements and garages, only to be appreciated by his first core of loyal fans, this album was captured amidst rigorous touring, growing anticipation and now, expectation. If his ability to survive the last ten years are any indication, Wolf will rise to the occasion and beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I see this album as my Southernplayalistic and I hope it does what \\\"Hey Ya!\\\" or \\\"B.o.B\\\" did for Outkast,\\\" says the artist who was featured on Big Boi's 2010 single \\\"You Ain't No DJ\\\" that was produced by Andre 3000. \\\"The goal of making albums is seeing where else you can go. I made sure everything I made was at the core, true to what i was.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/79-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"rV1wIRLz0oM\",\"title\":\"Yelawolf - Radio (Prod. by Jim Jonsin) (Radioactive Nov. 2011) HQ\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rV1wIRLz0oM\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rV1wIRLz0oM\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.yelawolf.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/yelawolf\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/yelawolf\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/yelawolf\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"yelawolf\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1684309,\"name\":\"Bubba Sparxxx\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"It seems like Country Rap is starting to take over mainstream. With the recent success of Colt Ford and The Lacs along with current \\\"rap style\\\" hits by country mega stars Jason Aldean (Dirt Road Anthem), Toby Keith (Red Solo Cup) and Tim McGraw (Truck Yeah), one would think that this is a new concept. But if you are a true hip-hop historian you would recall that this movement actual began in 2001 with the release of Bubba Sparxxx's debut album \\\"Dark Days, Bright Nights\\\". The\\nvideo for the first single \\\"Ugly\\\" featured Bubba and pals in the mud with pigs, on\\ntractors and performing in front of a house covered with bug lights. If that's not the epitome of Country, then nothing is.\\n\\nThe platinum certified \\\"Dark Days, Bright Nights\\\" debuted on Interscope Records in October 2001 and was produced by Houchins and superstar producers\\nTimbaland and Organized Noize. It was follow-up by the critically acclaimed 2003 release \\\"Deliverance\\\".\\n\\n\\\"I remember thinking, as a 12 or 13 year old kid, that the spirit of hip-music wasn't a whole lot different than the spirit of \\\"outlaw\\\" country music I had grown up hearing around my pops and uncles.\\\" Bubba recalls. \\\"The rebellious nature of say NWA, or 2 Live Crew, or The Geto Boys, in the late 80s, early 90s just wasn't that different from the movement that guys like Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Billy Joe Shaver\\nand others created by simply being themselves and saying what they wanted. Not to mention things were changing in rural areas, during my teenage years. The various drug epidemics had penetrated my neck of the woods, and the \\\"reality\\\" of life in the country had begun to shift. Folks were still hard working, and had traditional values, but drugs, and violence had become more prevalent, as a new generation of boys and girls, became man and women, in this environment. In some ways, the lower class, even out there where we were, started to identify as much with rap music, as country. This coincided with hip-hop, and rap exploding on popular culture, so\\nthe merging of the two genres, in terms of people\\n\\n\\\"With the first album \\\"Dark Days Bright Nights\\\" we knew the people we wanted to reach, but didn't necessarily know how to reach them. This would really be the case with \\\"Deliverance\\\", a couple years later. We had hooked up with Organized\\nNoize, and Timbaland, two of the most accomplished, and respected names in urban music, and they had really bought in to what we were trying to do. This was\\nan exciting time! We were very successful with the first album, taking baby steps toward bringing the two worlds together. The lyrics, and imagery were definitely\\ncountry but the music was still pretty urban leaning. In retrospect, that's probably right where we needed to be at that time. As we prepared to record the 2nd album, \\\"Deliverance\\\", it was actually Timbaland, who decided the music needed to match the lyrics and imagery. \\\"\\n\\n\\\"As bold as \\\"Deliverance\\\" was, it was probably too big of a leap forward to win commercially when it was released in 2003. We were still marketing, and promoting the \\\"old way\\\" and spending tons of money at radio and trying to get MTV and BET to play the video. It was also at a time when Lil John had the whole world \\\"crunk.\\\"\\nLooking back, it's actually pretty remarkable that the song and album \\\"Deliverance\\\"did as well as they did. We just didn't know how to reach the people we wererepresenting. Keep in mind there was no YouTube, and the Internet was still an infant in terms of the impact it would soon have on music. Interscope Records did the best they could, based on the way they did things at the time, but in the end we all failed miserably in thinking of ways to market an album so outside of the box.\\n\\nI will slap anybody who questions my right to sit at this table, and eat. We fought wars for this, and it wasn't always this easy.\\nNew South.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":440,\"height\":552},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":376},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":251},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-og.jpg\",\"width\":440,\"height\":552},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":125},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":440,\"height\":552},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":440,\"height\":552},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/15/67-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bubbasparxxx.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/bubbasparxxx\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/TheRealBubbaK\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/TheRealBubbaK\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"TheRealBubbaK\"},{\"id\":1684313,\"name\":\"Jelly Roll\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"With his wealth of tattoos, Southern rapper Jelly Roll is an illustrated man.
