All tickets will be honored at the new venue. Apologies for any inconvenience.\\n------------\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Lupe Fiasco, inspiration is attained amongst high altitudes. Sometimes literally\u2013\u2013the avant-garde MC has been known to climb Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro for both charity and clarity\u2013\u2013and other times, in the figurative form of great men's greater work. Philosopher and linguistic scholar Noam Chomsky, scribe supreme James Baldwin, historian Howard Zinn, religious activist Malcolm X, have all contributed to the worldly perspectives of the man born Wasalu Muhammad. Yet, no icon has lent greater influence to the 30-year-old orator's latest work than Baldwin. Jimmy's masterful writings and truth unfurling documentaries like \\\"Take The Hammer\\\" supplied motivation for quite possibly Lupe's definitive album, Food & Liquor 2: The Great American Rap Album. \\n\\nIn Lupe Fiasco's world, the greatest art is the purest art. Thus after a colorful six-year career, which wrought three studio albums\u2013\u2013the lyrical dissertation Food & Liquor (2006), its thematic successor The Cool (2009) and controversy-drenched LASERS (2011)\u2013\u2013as well as much tension between MC and label (Atlantic Records), he's created an album solely for his soul. With the spirit of aforementioned influences\u2013\u2013brilliant thinkers, impassioned activists, unapologetic rebellions\u2013\u2013this selfish masterpiece was birthed in the vein of opus standards like Mos Def's Black On Both Sides and Nas's It Was Written. In an ironic nutshell, F&L2 backseats Lupe's occupation to feed his essence: rap\u2013\u2013in the purest sense of the word\u2013\u2013artist. \\\"What I've learned is not to take anybody's advice,\\\" says Lupe. \\\"Because if you rely solely on your fans it sets you up for the downfall on the industry side and if you rely on what your label is saying it will disconnect you from your fans.\\\"\\n\\nFood & Liquor 2: The Great American Rap Album is much more than a mere sequel; instead equal halves American history documentary and honor roll rap skill exhibition. Your average Hip-Hop album features a tall guest list and short stack of truth; F&L2 offers a welcomed imbalance of features to facts. While the sound bed for \\\"Lamborghini Angels\\\" zips like nightlife, true tales, brilliantly woven together, hold your attention captive. Though the \\\"Unforgivable Youth\\\" track rocks, its content's comparison of present prison systems and slave trades provide the real hardcore. From pedophilia to US soldiers photographing mutilated prisoners, Lupe uses his latest to spotlight historic ugly made in the USA. \\\"I tried to find the great American experience and reflect on American phenomenon, American history, American mythology, American cultural movements,\\\" says Lupe. \\\"It's a completely biased endeavor because it's one man's point of view. So what I did was focus on general themes that we can all agree upon. A majority of them are hideous, but because they're historically documented, it can't be refuted.\\\"\\n\\nLupe's fourth studio album was born to give Hip-Hop a deeper look inside a nation that often views it as a black eye. It's also a return to his original M.O. Since wheeling into the rap game in 2006 with the Native Tongue-refreshed and eventually twice Grammy-nominated \\\"Kick Push,\\\" the martial arts expert has maintained a mission to be the most proficient with pen and mic. Still feeling that the lyrical density of his early greatness \\\"Failure\\\" remains unmatched, Sir Fiasco further distances current competition as \\\"lyrical Zuckerberg\\\" on the alarming \\\"Audobon Ballroom\\\" and The Runners-produced \\\"Braveheart\\\" (\\\"Took wood from a slave ship to furnish my abode\u2026now that's a house of pain/plus I use nooses to hang up all my clothes\\\"). \\n\\nThe Muslim wordsmith's unwavering attention to craft has inspired a most committed fan base. In 2010 when Lupe's label refused to release LASERS, the Fiasco faithful picketed outside Atlantic Records and drew a 16,000-signature online petition. How did the rapper respond? He traveled to Africa to clear his mind and climb the Motherland's tallest mountain to raise money for water wells. Then he returned home and did what he's done since teaming with Jill Scott on his first LP (\\\"Daydreamin\\\") and Mathew Santos on his sophomore effort (\\\"Superstar\\\"): he made a couple hit records (\\\"The Show Must Go On,\\\" \\\"Words I Never Said,\\\" featuring Skylar Grey), scoring his second consecutive Gold album. While F&L2 boasts mass-appeal performances from soul stars like Bilal and Jamaroquai, Lupe has zero interest in appeasing radio programmers. He'd much rather speak his experiences through the resurrection of Pete Rock and CL Smooth's classic \\\"T.RO.Y.\\\" for his first single \\\"Around My Way [Freedom Ain't Free].\\\" And if he must target female ears, it's not to seduce, instead empower with the enlightening \\\"Bitch Bad.\\\" \\\"I don't necessarily have an idea of success, and I think that's what makes things so problematic for me when I have to deal with [commercial demands],\\\" says Lupe, before widening the lens on his perspective. \\\"This world is immaterial. God showed me all these things\u2013\u2013you wanna know what it feels like to perform for 80,000 people? Here. You wanna look at your bank account and not have to worry about anything? Here\u2013\u2013and then took it away so none of that shit moves me. Now all I wanna make is social commentary and good-feeling music.\\\"\\n\\nIt makes sense that a rapper who can be in Cairo riding a camel on one day, and in Los Angeles, whipping one of his many Ferraris, the next is ready to broaden Hip-Hop minds. It's no surprise that an MC who doesn't leave home without the Autobiography of Malcolm X has constructed one of rap's most nutrimental albums. All one has to do is ingest Lupe Fiasco's James Baldwin praises and Wasalu Muhammad's big picture appears in HD: \\\"His point of view was unrelenting\u2026he would not let America apologize half-ass. Then to be so against the rules, it was almost like he was writing the rules, dictating them. Yet he fully understood everybody's points of views and side of the story.\\\"\\n\\nSound familiar?\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":539},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":539},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":168},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":168},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":112},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":112},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":575},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":56},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":56},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":281},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":281},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":365},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/94/15-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":365}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.lupefiasco.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/lupefiasco\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/LupeFiasco?ref=search&sid=15211625.2319668448..1\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/lupefiasco\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"lupefiasco\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1394397,\"name\":\"The Boy Illinois\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Every once in a while, in those gusts of Chicago winds, you'll come across something worth keeping. And that's precisely what happened when The Boy Illinois crept onto the music scene. The 25-year-old University of Illinois college drop-out is on a mission to grab the ears of listeners with slick delivery, sharp wordplay and most importantly by doing what he does best \u2013 being himself. And the mission, though not complete, is well underway.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany have tried to compare him to other hip-hop artists but, The Boy Illinois or better known as Illi, is in a league of his own. With honest, heartfelt lyrics coupled with hard hitting beats mostly from in-house production duo, The Baron Boys, who've produced for the likes of Drake, Nipsey Hussle, Bow Wow and more; the young lyricist, performer and songwriter plans to follow in the footsteps of Chicago artists before him, while carving out his own place in music history.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking the decision to leave college early isn't for everyone, however for William Dalton it wasn't so much a decision but a necessity. \\\"I started really performing and decided that I needed to take this [music] seriously. I knew this is what I wanted my career to be\\\", says The Boy Illinois. The son of a musician and singer, music was always in his home while growing up, and the influence of old school jazz and R&B is quite apparent as you listen to his distinct ability to harmonize on his own hooks. \\\"I would get tired of trying to find singers to sing my hooks the way I wrote them\\\", says Illinois. \\\"So I would just do them by myself, and it worked.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe first made noise in 2008, with the release of Inhale Part 1: State Representative. 19-years-old, a freshman in college and with no manager, the project is raw and definitely reflects a young Illinois, however it was apparent even from the beginning that he had a natural ability to express his life through music.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year later in August 2009 he released hjs sophomore mixtape Inhale Part 2: Loyalty Before the Love on which he showed amazing lyrical growth and overall progression as an artist. More poised, and with all original production, the project caught the attention of many lifestyle and music blogs officially putting Illi on the map as an up-and-coming hip-hop artist. However, it wasn't until his third effort in October 2010, Inhale Pt. 3: After School Program, that Illinois would start to become recognized as one of Chicago's \\\"next up\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a polished, commercial yet genuine sound, incredible production, over 12,000 downloads, 7 music videos culminating in over 33,000 views on YouTube, and a solid team, Illinois slowly but steadily has begun to take his reign if you may. One of his big breaks came in August of 2011 when his music video for popular single Cardigan Sweater was chosen to be featured on MTV's Rapfix Live 'Get in the Game' segment. Receiving praise from host Sway and special guest Game who commented that The Boy Illinois \\\"fits right into today's hip-hop\\\", he was one of the few 'Get in the Game' artists invited back to participate in Rapfix's One Year Anniversary show. It was there that The Boy Illinois proved why exactly he's next to shine with a standout freestyle during on on-air cipher. He's gone on to be featured on Sirius XM Shade 45 Sway in the Morning show, XXL, The Source, HipHopDX, Thisis50 and more, and recently on October 25, 2011, The Boy Illinois celebrated the release of his fourth mixtape Inhale Pt. 4: Horai, at the coveted House of Blues with a private listening party presented by DJBooth. Can you say progress?\\r\\n\\r\\nRapping since the age of 15 and with almost 4 official years in the game, The Boy Illinois isn't a fad. He's not just selling great singles but is creating a timeless music catalog that can be revisited over and over. He isn't an artist that was meant to \\\"blow up\\\" quickly either, but rather an artist you take the time to get to know and begin to appreciate over time. The greats often take time to reach greatness, and if anything can be said for William Dalton, it is that he will without a doubt reach greatness in his own time and on his own terms. \\\"Yer.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/the-boy-illinois\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/imilli/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/theboyillinois\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"theboyillinois\"},{\"id\":1775148,\"name\":\"RXMN\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1310825?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
