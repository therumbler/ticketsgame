Through constant touring and a zeal to travel down new musical avenues in the studio, BHTM (as their dedicated fans call them) have honed their collective stew of influences into a trademark hybrid sound that\u2019s immediately recognizable. Now, with Black Beehive, their maiden release on Shout! Factory (February 4, 2014), the quartet has made its most personal and poignant album to date, a collection of new studio tracks that, says co-founder and figurehead Todd Park Mohr, \u201callows us to truly reach our audience through the language of the blues.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nRecorded at Butcher Boy Studios in Chicago, Mohr\u2019s hometown of the past seven years, and produced and mixed by Grammy-winning multi-instrumentalist Steve Jordan (whose previous production credits include John Mayer, Buddy Guy, Solomon Burke and Robert Cray), Black Beehive arrives a quarter-century after the group\u2019s debut album, Another Mayberry, first put Big Head Todd & the Monsters on the map beyond their home base. Today, the original trio\u2014Mohr on guitar and vocals, Brian Nevin on drums and vocals and Rob Squires on bass and vocals\u2014along with keyboardist/pedal steel guitarist Jeremy Lawton, who joined in 2004, are still opening themselves to new possibilities even as they further explore their roots. \u201cIt has some contemporary elements that bridge a gap between alternative pop and traditional blues,\u201d says Mohr about Black Beehive, whose title refers to the late British soul singer Amy Winehouse, the inspiration behind the album\u2019s title track. \u2028\u2028The band approached the recording in an old-school organic fashion, playing together in the studio, which Mohr describes as \u201ca big open space,\u201d and sticking to the basics. \u201cI played resonator guitar on almost every song and most of the album is kind of simple: guitar, slide guitar, drums and bass,\u201d he says. \u201cWe only had two guests on the album. One was Eddie Shaw, who was Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s harmonica player for many years, and Ronnie Baker Brooks, who played guitar. And Steve Jordan played on almost every track\u2014various things, percussion, rhythm guitar.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nJordan, whose incredible career began when he joined Stevie Wonder\u2019s band as a teenager, later going on to perform in the Saturday Night Live band,\u00a0Paul Shaffer's\u00a0World's Most Dangerous Band\u00a0on\u00a0Late Night with David Letterman, and backing John Belushi and Dan Akroyd when they toured as The Blues Brothers, has an unbelievable production roster but is also well-known as a drummer. A member of the John Mayer Trio, Jordan also toured and recorded with Keith Richards and the X-pensive Winos, joined Eric Clapton for his 2006 European tour, and has also worked with Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, B.B. King, James Brown and more. \\r\\n\\r\\nMohr first met Jordan through the legendary guitarist Hubert Sumlin, who died in 2011. \u201cWe were planning to have an 80th birthday party for Hubert,\u201d says Todd, \u201cand Steve was the musical director. When Hubert passed away it ended up being a tribute at the Apollo Theater: Eric Clapton and Billy Gibbons and Keith Richards\u2014there were probably 35 incredible musicians at this thing. I was immediately awestruck by Steve\u2019s command of the material and his understanding of it and his ability to get it done on short notice with all these people. I thought this guy would be an unbelievable producer for me to work with. I sent him some demos and he was up for it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he began writing material for the album, Mohr drew from both his own life experiences and events in the news. The title track was written following Winehouse\u2019s death. \u201cI love her voice and her performances, and obviously her shenanigans were part of her persona,\u201d says Mohr. Several other songs were also ripped from the headlines, including \u201cWe Won\u2019t Go Back,\u201d which Mohr penned about the 2010 Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East, and \u201cFear, Greed and Ignorance,\u201d whose topical lyrics declare that it\u2019s those three dishonorable traits that are \u201cdriving you America off the edge of the road.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nNot every track is quite so pointed, however. \u201cHubert\u2019s Dream,\u201d is a nod to the late Mr. Sumlin, while album opener \u201cHey Delila\u201d is Mohr\u2019s tribute to another blues giant, Memphis Minnie. \u201cI happened to acquire a great example of her instrument, which was a 1941 Spanish National resonator guitar. Plus, she has an incredible life story,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything About You\u201d is dedicated to NASA, who called upon BHTM to awaken the Discovery space shuttle crew with their song \u201cBlue Sky\u201d in 2011, marking the first time live music was ever used for that purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the album\u2019s other tunes, \u201cJosephina\u201d and \u201cSeven State Lines\u201d are what Mohr describes simply as \u201cblues-based themes,\u201d while \u201cI Get Smooth\u201d is \u201ca comedy piece.\u201d The cautionary tale \u201cTravelin\u2019 Light\u201d is the story of lovers who \u201cthrew away our hearts and fled\u201d and the moving \u201cForever Bonnie\u201d is based on a true story of a \u201cgentleman who got a love letter delivered to him 53 years later by the Postal Service.\u201d Black Beehive also includes, as a bonus track, Big Head Todd & the Monsters\u2019 burning take on the Jimmy Reed blues classic \u201cBaby What You Want Me To Do,\u201d a song that Jordan requested they cut.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor BHTM, Black Beehive serves as both a reaffirmation of the band\u2019s roots and a step into the next 25 years. Founded as a trio in Boulder, Colorado in 1986, Big Head Todd & the Monsters quickly built a strong reputation on the local club circuit. As word of their soulful and intense live show traveled around the nation they found themselves filling larger and larger venues. BHTM have now played Denver\u2019s historic Red Rocks Amphitheatre more than 20 times, and are embedded in the fabric of Colorado\u2019s music scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with Another Mayberry in 1989, critics noticed what audiences at BHTM live shows already knew. The All Music Guide praised the \u201csubtlety of Mohr\u2019s lyrics\u201d and his \u201cindividual world view.\u201d But it was the follow-up, 1990\u2019s Midnight Radio, that truly established the band as a creative force to be reckoned with. Its popularity led to a major label contract and the release of the platinum-selling Sister Sweetly in 1993. With subsequent albums such as 1994\u2019s Strategem and 1997\u2019s Beautiful World, the band earned a place among the top names on the jam band circuit, solidified by 1998\u2019s Live Monsters, the first official concert recording by Big Head Todd & the Monsters. Riviera was released in 2002, followed by 2004\u2019s Crimes of Passion, of which The London Times stated \\\"American rock doesn't get anymore classy than this.\\\" Later that year, Live at the Fillmore was released to critical praise. All Music Guide called the release, the band\u2019s first with Jeremy Lawton, \u201cloud, proud, and full of righteous raw ambience.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band, which has always proudly controlled its own business dealings and marketing, gave away 2007\u2019s All the Love You Need through their email list, radio stations, and magazines. Their ninth studio album, Rocksteady, followed in 2010. Said Examiner.com, \u201cWith Rocksteady, the Colorado boys prove they can sprinkle in a plethora of differing music styles and still rock.\u201d 2011\u2019s 100 Years of Robert Johnson, the album preceding Black Beehive, found the group paying tribute to the pioneering bluesman while performing as Big Head Blues Club (along with other notable blues legends, including B. B. King, Charlie Musselwhite, Cedric Burnside, David \u201cHoneyboy\u201d Edwards, Sumlin, Ruthie Foster, and Lightnin\u2019 Malcolm). The band toured behind the album with a few of the guest artists, marking some of the final performances by both Edwards and Sumlin. Mohr paid tribute to Sumlin in 2012 when he served as a featured artist at his tribute show at the Apollo Theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all of that history behind them, it would be easy for Big Head Todd & the Monsters to play the nostalgia card and fall back on past glories, but that\u2019s of no interest to them. BHTM still performs, and devoutly loves, the material that first brought them to their fans \u2013 material they now approach with a fresh, seasoned perspective. \u201cAs a writer and as a human being there\u2019s a big difference between being 21 and 47,\u201d says Mohr. \u201cHaving said that, I think a lot of those compositions are still lyrically sound, even though it\u2019s hard for me to imagine that I would have had the experience to write about the stuff I did. Obviously, I think the band has gotten better over the years because when you develop yourself you continue to improve, and I think we have improved musically. As a writer, I\u2019m really pleased with where I\u2019m at right now.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cA lot of it had to do with my experience with the Robert Johnson project,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat had a large impact on how I looked at music. For a large portion of my career, I\u2019ve been trying to reproduce the success of Sister Sweetly, just as a touchstone of \u2018this is a pop song, or rock-pop.\u2019 Pop songs have pretty narrow rules when it comes down to it. Generally you need a chorus and a bridge. The blues material from Robert Johnson\u2019s day, the prewar blues, was so fascinating to me because of the fact that it is pop music but there are no choruses. It\u2019s a different way of having repetition and themes and a different goal for a pop song. The music is shared by everybody because it\u2019s passed down through tradition. The whole spirit of what one is going for is radically different than pop and that really became exciting for me because I could see a new way to reach people.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Big Head Todd & the Monsters launch their extensive national tour behind Black Beehive in January\u2014which will continue through the summer and hit most major markets\u2014they will be honing the album\u2019s ageless blues along the way, and simultaneously affirming their own longevity. It\u2019s clear that they possess a rare musical wholeness that has not only survived for 25 plus years, but still has them looking forward to creating music together night after night. \u201cThe other guys have shown great support of my songwriting and what I\u2019m able to do, and all of the band members bring a lot to the plate, both musically and as a unit,\u201d says Mohr. \u201cNo one ever expects a band to last this long. We\u2019re very, very lucky.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":888,\"height\":592},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-og.jpg\",\"width\":888,\"height\":592},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/01/81-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Ct5jr4RSrc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bigheadtodd.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/BigHeadToddandtheMonsters/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bhtm\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bhtm\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://opheliasdenver.ticketfly.com/event/1378530?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
