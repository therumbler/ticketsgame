His story is about life; a story about religion and family, addiction, survival, sobriety, and freedom \u2013 with music as the narrator. His song, Riser (2014) recorded by country superstar, Dierks Bentley, says it all\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m a riser\u2026 I\u2019m a get up off the ground, don\u2019t run and hide-er, Pushing comes to shove, hey I\u2019m a fighter, When darkness comes to town, I\u2019m a lighter, A get out alive-er, Of the fire\u2026 Survivor.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOverwhelmingly recognized by top recording artists as the \\\"go to\\\" talent for heartfelt hits, Meadows has written songs for Jake Owen, Dierks Bentley, Eric Church, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Frankie Ballard, Lee Ann Womack, Blackberry Smoke, Mary Gauthier, and more...\\r\\n\\r\\n----\\r\\n\\r\\nPAST\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing up in Jackson, Mississippi, where \u201cHell ain\u2019t half that hot\u2026you could fry eggs on the parking lot,\\\" he remembers his life as being filled with loss very early on. His first memory was of his brother drowning, his parents divorce and a near death experience with cancer at age fourteen. \u201cIt was really sexy going through puberty and chemo at the same time,\u201d but that was the least of his hurdles.\\r\\n\\r\\nTravis laid the foundation for his music career while making the rounds at local bars and clubs, performing with legendary blues players, such as Sam Myers (Anson Funderburg and the Rockets) and Fingers Taylor (Jimmy Buffett). He also laid the foundation for a drug and alcohol problem that would haunt him for years. His original high came at 11 years old from stealing his grandmother\u2019s Valium, then at 24 with a \u201cGod experience\u201d that led him to the world of Christian music, trading one addiction for another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhen I was getting high, I wanted everybody to get high too\u2026on drugs, on alcohol, on Jesus.\u201d He went on to tour the world as a Christian rock artist, spreading \u201cThe Word\u201d across the globe the only way he knew how, through music. However, he found that \u201cthe truth will set you free, but eventually it\u2019ll piss you off.\u201d He arrived in Nashville and learned the hard way about fame and fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI came to town to make a difference. I had a story to tell. I told it loud, but my opinion didn\u2019t go over so well. Waiting for offers, they never came, the Davidson County Police know my name\u2026if dumb makes you famous, then I can\u2019t complain, the Davidson Country Police know my name.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in the midst of his self-destruction, his talent prevailed. He received a 2001 ASCAP Christian Music Award, had eight Top 20 singles in the Contemporary Christian genre, and landed a staff writer deal with Scott Gunter at Universal Music Publishing Group in 2005. As a staff writer, Travis wrote with celebrated writers and artists, from Nashville to London, and garnered cuts by Lynyrd Skynyrd, Lee Ann Womack, and Jake Owen, as well as numerous #1 singles and five RIAA Gold Records with Australian artist Adam Brand. However, the spiral of addiction continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, Travis\u2019 Old Ghosts & Unfinished Business caught up with him. Somewhere between jail and rehab something in him began to reach out and up again as he returned to the one constant in his life: writing. What started out as a journal for his counselor mysteriously turned into a manifesto of survival on vinyl. Killin\u2019 Uncle Buzzy was a resurrection of sorts. When asked what changed, Travis simply says, \u201cEverything...\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nPRESENT\\r\\n\\r\\nWell-known among songwriter circles in Nashville, Travis is an unforgettable performer. He is an open wound, the rawness of his words and his vocals pulling you into his world. A Mississippi childhood, learning to drink his coffee black in dives off the highway, his battles with cancer, alcohol, drugs, God and demons, and all the characters along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIf you want to listen to Travis\u2019 songs, be prepared for them to resonate with raw emotion. They have honesty, a viewpoint you wouldn\u2019t have expected, and every once in a while, a bit of humor. If you want to hear the same things over and over, turn on the radio. If you want to listen to songs that will be food for your soul, that cause you to have to hit repeat, then you should listen to \u201cOld Ghosts & Unfinished Business.\u201d\\r\\n- Joe Galante, former Chairman, Sony Music Nashville\\r\\n\\r\\nNow signed to Kobalt Music Publishing, Travis\u2019 songs have recently been recorded by Ronnie Dunn, Dierks Bentley, Levi Lowery, Eric Church, Blackberry Smoke, Adam Brand, Peter Fox of Go West and his most recent hit \u201cWhat We Ain\u2019t Got\u201d by Jake Owen. See below for the official music video featuring Travis in a moving interpretation of the song.\\r\\n\\r\\nTravis describes his life as \u201cone big exhale\u201d now\u2026 no big plans\u2026 just glad to be alive\u2026\\r\\n\\r\\nMeadows is currently playing around Nashville and touring across the US, as he prepares for the release of his new record in 2015. Aside from live shows, you can find him featured on the new television series Nashville Unleashed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cBreathe, breathe, fill your lungs with better air\u2026 reach, reach cause you know it\u2019s waiting there\u2026 I\u2019ve found letting go of what you\u2019re holdin\u2019, leaves your heart and arms a little more wide open\u201d\u2026 Travis Meadows is wide open.\\r\\n\\r\\n--\\r\\nPRESS\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cSongs and music can change people\u2019s lives. This is one of those songs you get once a career that has the possibility to do that.\u201d\\r\\n- Dierks Bentley, Billboard, June 2015. Read here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The week of CMA Fest is brimming with satellite events and at the Chords for a Cause Benefit at local Irish pub Dan McGuinness, gifted singer-songwriter Travis Meadows made it clear that the festival organizers should be giving him an official showcase pronto. Backed by a lap-steel guitarist and a caj\u00f3n player, the raspy-voiced storyteller raised chills with his heartrending, confessional ballad \\\"Unfinished Business,\\\" as well as tunes of his that have been covered by some of country's elite. Among them: an emotional take on \\\"What We Ain't Got\\\" \u2014 a hit for Jake Owen \u2014 and \\\"Riser,\\\" the defiant title track of Dierks Bentley's latest album.\\\"\\r\\n- \\\"Best Shoulda Been a CMA Fest Show: Travis Meadows\\\" ROLLING STONE, June 2015. Read here.\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I love Travis as a singer-songwriter. A couple of records ago, I cut one of his songs called 'Cherry on Top,' which is a long way from this song. He had a record called 'Killin' Uncle Buzzy,' which he wrote when he was getting treatment, and the song ['What We Ain't Got'] was on the record, and I would sit on the bus while I was out on the road and listen to it...There was so much honesty in it. I've learned that in order for me to move on down the road in my career and be a part of this genre that it's all about great songs. It doesn't matter who wrote it or where it came from. It's all about the music.\\\"\\r\\n- Jake Owen, Billboard, 2014.

Read here.\\r\\n\u201cI run into people everyday in search of authenticity. They want to discover the real deal. Well, call off the search \u2013 I\u2019ve found him. His name is Travis Meadows. I am proud to call him a friend and I\u2019m in awe of his talent. Killin\u2019 Uncle Buzzy is the most honest record I\u2019ve ever heard. In one word, it is stellar! I can\u2019t wait to hear what comes next!\u201d\\r\\n- Eric Church, 2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThat\u2019s what country music was based on, great songs\u2026\u201d\\r\\n- Jake Owen, referring to What We Ain\u2019t Got - Radio.com, 2014. Read here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cSo hot, people in Nashville gather around him just to keep their hands warm.\u201d\\r\\n- Jon Eben (fellow Nashville songwriter)\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cTravis is one of the true poets of our generation. The man is brilliant. When you\u2019re in the writing room with him, you\u2019d better be on your game. He brings a cannon and he only aims for the kill shot. It\u2019s an honor to get to be a part of a few of his songs.\u201d\\r\\n- Jeremy Spillman (hit Nashville songwriter, friend and co-writer on Eric Church\u2019s Dark Side)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"ONE MAN. ONE GUITAR. AND THE TRUTH.\\\"\\r\\n- Bev Miskus, www.nashvillethreesixty.com, 2015. Read here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhat We Ain\u2019t Got [by Jake Owen] \u2014 penned by Travis Meadows and Travis Jerome Goff \u2014 packs a punch, with lyrics expressing the damaging power of always wanting more and never been satisfied. Whether it\u2019s a better car, a bigger house, or a different kind of love, as we chase what we don\u2019t have, we miss the good that is right in front of us.\u201d\\r\\n- Carrie Horton, Taste Of Country, 2014. Read here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"His love for his roots is undeniable, and eloquently expressed in songs about his grandfather teaching him to stay away from the sissy stuff and drink his coffee \u201cBlack\u201d. But underneath the country charm, what is also undeniable is the deep well his songs are drawn from, one that was chiseled out through pain and loss, death and rebirth.\\\"\\r\\n- Lisa Morgan, Coachella Valley Weekly, 2015. Read here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cTravis initially had the idea to write a song called Survivor. He started improvising a bunch of brilliance and asked me what I thought. I said, \u201cMan, I love what you\u2019re doing, but I don\u2019t feel qualified to write this song. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve survived enough to really contribute.\u201d He said, \u201cMoakler, I was saving this idea for you. You\u2019re so damn optimistic, and that\u2019s what makes you qualified.\u201d So I listened to him, and then we wrote the song. It\u2019s really affirming that he thought of me with an idea like that, and I still hear the song as something to live up to. I feel empowered and hopeful every time I sing it.\u201d\\r\\n- Steve Moakler (co-writer on Dierks Bentley\u2019s Riser) \u2013 DBcongress.com, 2013. Read here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cTravis Meadows is one of the most promising (and truly talented) songwriters to ever come out of Nashville.\u201d\\r\\n- NashvillGab.com speaks with Travis about Dierks Bentley\u2019s Riser, 2013. Read here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201c\u2026it\u2019s hard to pigeonhole Meadows as a \u201ccountry\u201d writer; he\u2019s definitely got few great ballads that work within the country framework-and a couple up-tempos that could lend an ear to, but he\u2019s got plenty to offer alternative genres as well. And being a good singer and an artist in his own right certainly doesn\u2019t hurt his applicability.\u201d\\r\\n- Doug Waterman - American Songwriter, 2008. Read here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cSinger songwriter Travis Meadows is an artist to the core, but his is not a story about music alone. It is a story about life; a story about religion and family; a story about addiction; a story about survival, sobriety and freedom, with music as the narrator.\u201d\\r\\n- Frank Brown International Songwriters\u2019 Festival. Read here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cAs a counselor I am always searching for ways to reach clients. While presenting at the C.O.R.E. conference, I came across a singer/songwriter that inspired me with his words and passion. Travis Meadows is far from a clinician, but music at times plays a huge role in a treatment plan. It reminded me of always finding a tool a client can relate to, and for Travis, it was music.\u201d\\r\\n- Heidi Voet Smith, LPC \u2013 AddictionPro.com, \\\"Travis Meadows: In tune with recovery,\\\" 2014.
