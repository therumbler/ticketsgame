Undaunted by this unexpected turn of events, The Planet Smashers began hunting, gathering and writing their finest album to date. Luckily the band was cryogenically frozen throughout the iceage and recently discovered trapped inside an iceberg floating down the Saint Lawrence river.\\r\\nInspired by volcanic eruptions and constant dinosaur attacks, \\\"Descent Into The Valley Of\u2026\\\" is 15 tracks of pure unadulaturated party ska awesomeness served up hot with an extra large order of radical sauce on the side just for good measure. From the hilariously addictive tom-foolery of \\\"The Hippopotamus\\\" to the darkly brooding \\\"Die Tomorrow\\\" to the punkrock insanity of \\\"Food Fight\\\" to the touching love song \\\"My Obsession\\\", this album delivers something for everyone while maintaining the Smashers' signature badassitude that has made them an international sensation for over 17 years\u2026Grab your club and put on your best wooly mammoth pelt, cuz this time they're making pre-history.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormed in 1994 in Montreal, Quebec, the Smashers's infectious pop infused melodies, rippin' horn licks and killer live shows, quickly established them as the city's \\\"Kings of Ska\\\". They released their first album (\\\"Self-Titled\\\") on Planet Smasher's founder Matt Collyer's own label STOMP Records and hit the road. By 1997 they were no longer a local band, but a national phenomenon, headlining shows across Canada and pushing their second record, \\\"Atttack of The Planet Smashers\\\" which reached #2 on the national college radio charts for 2 months straight. Their third album \\\"Life of The Party\\\" took the continent by storm, aided no doubt by the commercialization of ska by such bands as Mighty Mighty Bosstones and No Doubt. \\\"Life of the Party\\\", The Planet Smashers won the Montreal Independent Music Award for best ska band and drew attention from labels, bands, publishers and booking agents all over the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the band received much commercial attention during the ska wave, they decided to continue down the independent road with STOMP Records. Their fourth release, \\\"No Self Control\\\" was produced by Steven Drake (Tragically Hip, Barenaked Ladies, The Odds etc.) and was also well received by national college radio and spawned hit videos such as the animated \\\"Blind\\\" and the tongue in cheek \\\"Wish I Were American\\\". \\\"No Self Control\\\" was also the band's first internationally released record and reached #14 on the Tower retail sales charts in Japan!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Mighty\\\", the Planet Smashers' fifth full length for STOMP Records is chock full of summertime party songs that'll get your ass into party gear. \\\"Mighty\\\" was produced/engineered by Rod Shearer (Bran Van 3000, Bionic, Corey Hart) and co-produced by The Planet Smashers (not to mention mixed on the same board as Madonna's \\\"Like a Virgin\\\"!) Having moved past the dark and critical themes of \\\"No Self Control\\\", \\\"Mighty\\\" is a fun and positive record that provides the perfect soundtrack to any summer BBQ.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, STOMP Records produced a commemorative DVD entitled \\\"Ten\\\" featuring the last 10 years of the band. The DVD includes live footage from various shows from as early as 1994 and as recent as 2003 as well as 12 videos, 24 episodes of the Japanese animated series \\\"Catman\\\" (soundtrack by the Smashers), and a slew of stunts and shenanigans. Also in 2004, the Planet Smashers coincidentally did a month on the 10th year anniversary of the Vans Warped Tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band returned to the studio in 2005 to record their 6th album \\\"Unstoppable\\\", and marked the return of long time producer-friend Chris Murray (\\\"Attack of the...\\\" and \\\"Life of the Party\\\"). \\\"Unstoppable\\\" features guest appearances from Jay Malinowski of Bedouin Soundclash and Liam O'Neil of the Stills. After the album's release in May 2005, the Smashers hit the road for over a year of non-stop touring throughout North America and Europe, including yet another appearance on the Vans Warped Tour, two runs on the Ska Is Dead Tour, and even an attempt to branch out opening up for Simple Plan's Canadian arena tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of touring, not many indie Canadian bands come close. They have headlined countless tours in North America, 8 European tours, been included on 5 Vans Warped Tour as well as a Japanese tour in 2002. They have toured with such acts as AFI, GOB, Satanic Surfers, Sick of it All, Death By Stereo, Mustard Plug, Samiam, The Aquabats, Rancid, Guttermouth, Catch 22, and countless others. Now in their 16th year and having sold over 250,000 copies worldwide they plan to records a new album for spring release in 2011!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-og.jpg\",\"width\":1200,\"height\":1200},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/30/57-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.planetsmashers.net\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/ThePlanetSmashers\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Planet_Smashers\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Planet_Smashers\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1708199,\"name\":\"The Johnstones\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Most people know The Johnstones as the Ajax punk/ska band who have gained a notorious reputation for their high profile and controversial antics like:  Receiving a lifetime ban from Disneyland; spending numerous nights in jail; being chased out of the UK after pissing off the wrong soccer firm; and starting a highly publicized Justin Bieber riot at the Toronto G20 conference. Trouble became the Johnstones calling card. What started as a band of high school troublemakers creating their own Jackass-style music videos, has now, years later, become nothing short of a multimedia blitzkrieg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of the Johnstones began with a crazy punk band with a crazy live show and a lot of crazy videos. They quickly became a household name in the southern Ontario punk scene where they landed a management deal with then Canadian idol judge Zack Werner. Then they signed to STOMP RECORDS (WARNER) releasing their first album Word Is Bond in 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSuccess blossomed quickly and led to huge accomplishments. The Johnstones charted on the MuchMusic countdown, performed on TV shows including Canadian idol, MUCH Spring Break Special, Musiqueplus, MTV Live, breakfast television and countless others. The band toured the world with the likes of Hedley, Gob, Reel Big Fish, Less then Jake, The Mad Caddies and sold out headline shows to a thousand hardcore fans at the Toronto release or their most recent and very successful LP Can't be Trusted. As their following grew, with myspace and YouTube plays upwards of 5 million, The Johnstones created their very own annual package tour The Yellow Snow Tour. The Johnstones have been there and done that and made the t -shirt for you to buy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat separates the Johnstones from other bands is one of the most original and all-encompassing media networks you will find in Canadian music.  Years before online Q-and-As with bands were happening, The Johnstones were doing 30-minute live and interactive online shows with guests, sketches and audience participation garnering over five thousand live viewers. The Johnstones were also one of the first bands to do a weekly podcast with thousands of subscribers that led to their successful web-series, with millions of plays. Lots of bands are out there 'tweeting' and putting behind-the-scenes footage on YouTube but The Johnstones take their deep devotion to their fans much, much further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band has been featured in movies, TV shows and commercials They have toured with numerous successful side projects, done voice-overs for cartoons, hit the comedy scene, opening for acts like Jackass' Steve-O, and now have their own half-hour TV show, Crown The Town, that features their music, crazy antics, sketch comedy with very special guest appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no pocket of the media that the Johnstones haven't had their hands in. These guys take 'being a band' to a whole new level.  There is no line they won't cross in the name of entertainment as they continue to innovate and keep ahead of the curve. It actually became an ongoing joke in the industry that, much like The Simpsons, whatever new idea a band thought they had, \\\"The Johnstones had done it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now the Johnstones are back on the scene in a big way with their latest offering, Suck. The new album is fast and insane, encompassing everything that makes the Johnstones unique. The Johnstones are like a missile set to explode on the earth and it can't be slowed down by barriers, restrictions or, most importantly, the music industry.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thejohnstonessuck.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/TheJohnstones\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"TheJohnstones\"},{\"id\":1708201,\"name\":\"K-Man & The 45's\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.horseshoetavern.com/event/1315227?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
