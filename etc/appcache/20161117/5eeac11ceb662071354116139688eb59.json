may all your favorite bands stay together,\\\" sings Taylor Goldsmith on the title track to Dawes' fourth album, All Your Favorite Bands, on their own HUB Records, harking back to a time when that very\\r\\nspecial rock group helped define who you were, expressing the joy and passion the foursome put into\\r\\nthe release.\\r\\n\\\"Your favorite band can identify you, express how you see yourself,\\\" explains Goldsmith, who co-wrote\\r\\nthe song with Jonny Fritz and is the sole author of the album's other eight tracks. \\\"They enable you to\\r\\narticulate your feelings through the way they play their instruments and the lyrics.\\\"\\r\\nOn All Your Favorite Bands, Dawes manage to transcend their well-documented Southern California influences to establish their own sound and themes, which range from the glass half full optimism of the\\r\\nfirst single, \\\"Things Happen\\\" and the minor-chord tension of \\\"I Can't Think About It Now\\\" (featuring\\r\\nbackground vocals from Gillian Welch and the McCrary Sisters) to the soulful gospel of \\\"Waiting for Your Call,\\\" the rocking tongue-in-cheek lyrics of \\\"Right On Time\\\" and the epic, Dylan-esque set piece, \\\"Now\\r\\nThat It's Too Late, Maria.\\\"\\r\\nProduced by David Rawlings (Dave Rawlings Machine, Gillian Welch, Robyn Hitchcock, Old Crow\\r\\nMedicine Show, Willie Watson) at Woodland Sound Studios in Nashville, Dawes recorded these new\\r\\nsongs after they had already been road-tested in front of live audiences in intimate venues from\\r\\nSonoma to Santa Barbara, with Rawlings in tow. The producer even played guitar solos on two of the\\r\\ntracks (including that jangling noir Epiphone acoustic on \\\"Somewhere Along the Way\\\"), with Richard\\r\\nBennett on acoustic guitar and Paul Franklin on pedal steel, also contributing.\\r\\n\\\"We played and recorded the songs as a band, with very few overdubs,\\\" explains Taylor. \\\"It was a real\\r\\njoy to work with Dave, who is such an incredible musician with a deep understanding of what goes into a\\r\\nsong. We found ourselves immediately speaking a language we both understood.\\\"\\r\\nRawlings originally jammed with the band when they were Simon Dawes in their North Hills, CA, rehearsal space around seven years ago, then joined the group on one memorable occasion at the tiny\\r\\nCrepe Place in Santa Cruz for a raucous encore after one of his own shows down the street. Dave threw his hat in the ring to produce them, mutually agreeing on the goal of making their recordings sound more like they do live.\\r\\n\\\"I was always a big supporter of the way they went about things, and how hard they worked,\\\" said\\r\\nRawlings. \\\"I was also impressed with their growth as musicians.\\\"\\r\\nThe pairing of Dawes with Rawlings couldn't have been a more perfect match of band and producer.\\r\\n\\\"Playing these songs with them in a live setting in front of an audience before we ever set foot in the\\r\\nstudio was a lot of fun,\\\" enthused Rawlings. \\\"I was really pleased to see the new material not just\\r\\nholding its own with the older stuff, but in some cases sound even better and fresher.\\\"\\r\\nFresh from his game-changing experience working on the New Basement Tapes with producer T Bone\\r\\nBurnett and bandmates Marcus Mumford, Elvis Costello, Jim James, Rhiannon Giddens, Taylor took the\\r\\nspontaneity and organic interaction of those sessions \u2013 along with a newfound self-confidence \u2013 into recording the new album.\\r\\n\\\"We didn't get super-precious about it,\\\" he said. \\\"The rest of the band were able to react and respond in the moment, so even during the guitar solos, you can hear everyone else expressing themselves as\\r\\nwell.\\\"\\r\\nThe first single, \\\"Things Happen,\\\" is accompanied by a video that expresses Dawes' joie de vivre, a bittersweet tale of a Beatles busker (played by their actor friend Nate Michaux) who works Hollywood\\r\\nBlvd., where he meets fellow street performers Charlie Chaplin (Taylor), Elvis Presley (Gelber) and Marilyn Monroe (Strathairn in drag).\\r\\n\\\"In a literal way, I'm singing to a friend, but I'm also giving myself a pep talk,\\\" said Taylor. \\\"Things might\\r\\nbe bad, but the only thing you can do is shift your perspective to deal with it. Hoping it will go away by itself is a little unreasonable.\\\"\\r\\nThere are also glimpses of past relationships in \\\"Somewhere Along the Way\\\" and \\\"Waiting for Your Call,\\\"\\r\\nwhile \\\"I Can't Think About It Now\\\" offers a disquieting view of how repressing your problems ends up\\r\\nmaking things worse, and \\\"Right on Time\\\" describes the serendipity that makes up a long-lasting\\r\\nromance, posing a dichotomy between the dramatic music and the blatantly over-the-top lyrics. The\\r\\nsprawling, nine-minute-plus \\\"Now That It's Too Late Maria\\\" was the first song the band recorded in the\\r\\nstudio, and set the template for the album's loose-limbed, yet deliberate approach.\\r\\n\\\"Griffin played a relaxed, mid-tempo beat and I just started singing it that way,\\\" recalls Taylor. \\\"Dave\\r\\njust told us not to think about what we were doing, just do it, and that's what we did. It was a very\\r\\nspecial moment for us as a band. It really set the mood and made us confident and comfortable in our\\r\\nown skin, helped us embrace ourselves as a band. We realized nobody could do what the four of us do\\r\\ntogether.\\\"\\r\\nMaking the new album helped Dawes realize just how special \u2013 and unique \u2014 they were as a unit. It's a\\r\\nworthy addition \u2013 and a noticeable advance \u2013 on their three previous albums, 2009's debut North Hills,\\r\\n2011's Nothing Is Wrong and 2013's Stories Don't End.\\r\\n\\\"They are a tremendously talented group of guys focused solely on the music as part of their lives,\\\" offered Rawlings. \\\"I remember sitting in the control room with Taylor and Griff as they went through\\r\\ntheir iPods and pulled out pieces of songs, swapping ideas back and forth over a great breadth of different styles from all different eras. There's a good level of passion and friction, and there was a\\r\\nhealthy give-and-take, of questioning things, then coming to an informed decision in the studio. I certainly learned a great deal working on this album.\\\"\\r\\nTaylor suggested the energy of All Your Favorite Bands matches that of their very first album, though\\r\\nthis time the spontaneity was part of a concerted plan rather than the necessity of budgetary\\r\\nlimitations.\\r\\n\\\"There is so much joy in these songs, they make me smile when I hear them,\\\" he concluded. \\\"We woke\\r\\nup every day looking forward to the fact we would be playing together in the studio. That's all we ever\\r\\ncare about doing.\\\"\\r\\nAll Your Favorite Bands is the kind of album that could well make Dawes your favorite band.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/50/52/51-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.dawestheband.blogspot.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/dawestheband\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Dawestheband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/dawestheband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"dawestheband\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1380462?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
