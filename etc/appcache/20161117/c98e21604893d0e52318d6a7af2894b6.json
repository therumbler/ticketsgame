Well reader, in that sense you are correct. But this fall they're not only serving up their first full-length in five years, but\u2014after more than two decades together\u2014also embracing a total back to basics approach.\\r\\nThroughout a career that has run the gamut from self-releases and small indie imprints to large independent labels and major music conglomerates, the band has always been more than the sum of its parts. Now more than ever, though, they espouse their stature as a DIY collective that works together\u2014or at least in tandem with a few trusted allies\u2014on every element of their creative output. Drummer Vinnie Fiorello recalls, \\\"We started out very internal, and nowadays we handle a lot internally again. \\\"\\r\\nThe result of their old school approach is the old school sound of See The Light, created without any external meddling from corporate lackeys. \\\"Everyone had their alone time with chords and some quick structures; we all put our ideas down before we got together,\\\" says Vinnie. \\\"Then we sat at an octagon table in our warehouse and went through: this is what we think about this song, maybe we should do it ska, maybe we should do it punk\u2014true band songwriting in essence.\\\"\\r\\nNot only was the songwriting a true group effort, but\u2014like the three EPs the band have released since 2008's long-player GNV FLA\u2014so was the actual recording of See The Light, which was tracked entirely at Gainesville's The Moathouse, owned by LTJ bassist Roger Lima, who took lead production duties with communal input and assistance from his four band mates and live sound engineer.\\r\\n\\\"Roger has been recording our demos since the beginning of the band and steadily has worked his way up learning about studios from everyone we've worked with in the past,\\\" says trombone player Buddy Schaub. With no ticking clock and no studio fees piling up, the band used their breathing room to create somewhat of a rarity in today's prefab music world: a full-length album that gels as a complete thought, lyrically and musically. Buddy adds, \\\"I think this is one of the closest representations of our band to date. We're all really excited for this record to get out into the world and we can't wait to hear what people think!\\\"\\r\\nLike 2000's release Borders and Boundaries, the new record was mixed at the famed Blasting Room by punk rock legend Bill Stevenson (Descendents, Black Flag) and Jason Livermore, but don't let that lead you to believe that there's anything same-ish about See The Light. \\\"If you're expecting retreads and repeats, this record will disappoint,\\\" exclaims Roger. \\\"It's all new songs and new vibes only recorded in our old school way.\\\"\\r\\nWhile some other bands of a certain vintage are latching onto musical trends, you won't find any dubstep beats or vocoder distortion on See The Light\u2014a title that nods to the band's history of marrying dark lyrical content (the tunnel) to bouncy musical arrangements (the light at the end). Less Than Jake aren't turning away from their roots, and echoing Mark Twain, Fiorello points out that the rumors regarding their genre's demise are greatly exaggerated: \\\"Punk has been declared dead every year for 30+ years and it's still going stronger than ever. People like to declare things dead just because it's dead to them, but if bands are passionate about what they're doing, they'll attract fans who are passionate.\\\"\\r\\nAs fits a band born long enough ago to now be of legal drinking age, Less Than Jake pulls in a multi-generational audience, which Vinnie notes is often a family affair. \\\"Our crowd now is 16 to 40, and I've met kids as young as eight or nine. Dads bring their sons and it's a weird rite of passage; moms bring kids in saying, 'We've watched you guys for 15 years.' But will the band stick around long enough to draw in a third generation of fans? \\\"I don't know man. I think our guys on that would be NOFX and Bad Religion. When you see Fat Mike or Bad Religion hang it up, maybe: but like them, we're gonna ride that out.\\\"\\r\\nWe're glad to be along for the ride. Hop on board when See The Light sees the light on November 12!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":638},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1360},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":332},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":332},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":432},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/57-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":432}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.lessthanjake.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/lessthanjake\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/lessthanjake\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/lessthanjake\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"lessthanjake\"},{\"id\":1764457,\"name\":\"Pepper\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\u201cIt\u2019s the hardest thing we\u2019ve ever done as a band to make this record,\u201d says guitarist/vocalist Kaleo Wassman of Pepper, in speaking on the recording process of their new self-titled album. \u201cIt speaks loudly and widely to a broader audience while maintaining everything good about the band, which, first of all, is our positive attitude.\u201d After releasing five albums, Pepper has opened a new chapter in their storied career. Drummer Yesod Williams adds, \u201cThis record feels very cohesive in a way our past releases maybe didn\u2019t. I think it\u2019s an album that can appeal to everyone, as well.  We\u2019ve been pigeonholed in the past so this is an opportunity to transcend all that and spread our wings even wider.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nThe trio, who formed in 1997 and moved to the mainland from their hometown of Kailua Kona, Hawaii in 1999, pressed pause after the release of their fifth album, Pink Crustaceans and Good Vibrations, in 2008. There was a sense of fatigue and disunity amongst the three musicians, who took some time off from music both apart and together before rejoining to create an EP, Stiches, in late 2010. The songs on that release re-energized the group, revealing an urgent desire to make a new album that reflected where they are in their lives and career now. After some tour dates in support of the EP, Pepper sat down and focused on their sixth album, a self-titled released that swings open the door on this new chapter. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe musicians went into the studio with Matt Wallace, a producer known for his work with Maroon 5, O.A.R. and Faith No More, in early 2012. Matt helped focus the group\u2019s vision and expand their musical knowledge base, an experience the band members compare to being in their own version of college. The album was recorded in various studios over the course of a year, honing in on Pepper\u2019s re-defined self-identity and how that focus was reflected in the songs. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe learned so much,\u201d Yesod says. \u201cMatt help us really focus on the art of songwriting. He sat in the room with the three of us with a fine-tooth comb and went over every word, every melody, every sound. He showed us that it\u2019s important what you do play as well as what you don\u2019t play, creating both spaces in the songs. We learned how powerful simplicity can be. Plus, we had such a good time recording this album and I think that shows.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resulting album, self-titled to accentuate where the band feels they are presently, broadens Pepper\u2019s style, veering into new sonic territory while still retaining all the fun elements that make the band so beloved by their fans. The ever-present sense of life surges through the tracks, bolstering the sense of optimism throughout. The party anthems, the beach hang melodies, and the boisterous rhythms are all there, each song carefully crafted to best express these sunny moments by the ocean. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThis album is basically 12 snapshots of where we are,\u201d vocalist/bassist Bret Bollinger says. \u201cThere are songs that will remind you of your favorite Pepper songs, but by the end you\u2019ll hear some unexpected things. You\u2019ll realize that the songwriting is so much more refined. And there\u2019s laughter in the background of the songs. That\u2019s how good the vibe is on the record.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nPepper has toured extensively with groups like 311, Slightly Stoopid, Flogging Molly and Sublime With Rome, and spent several summers on Warped Tour \u2013 and this live sensibility shows. You can almost feel the sand in your toes and the sun on your back as the album progresses, the musician\u2019s amiable personalities palpable beneath the island rhythms and mellow tones. The band\u2019s music \u2013 both live and on their releases \u2013 is really about enjoying life and being grateful for each experience, a sensibility that\u2019s very familiar to the three musicians currently in their career. From their 1999 debut Give\u2019n It to their 2006 standout album No Shame, which was recorded with 311\u2019s Nick Hexum, No Doubt\u2019s Tony Kanal and Butthole Surfers\u2019 Paul Leary, Pepper has embodied not only a style of music but a lifestyle, one that\u2019s most easily found on beaches across the world, but also one that\u2019s relatable to anyone anywhere. \\r\\n\\r\\nReleased via their own label LAW Records, their universal appeal has led their music being placed in various movies and TV shows, including Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Good Luck Chuck, as well as several video game soundtracks. The band\u2019s story to date has been a prolific one. But as Pepper turns the page into a fresh chapter with this new album, it\u2019s clear that the band\u2019s passion for music and life will continue on for years to come. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re so blessed to be in this position,\u201d Kaleo says. \u201cWe want to do the best we can with it. We had humble beginnings in our small town in Hawaii and we\u2019re still that same humble band. We don\u2019t take any of this lightly. Every day I wake up and think about how I have the best job in the world. The level of gratitude and happiness I have that we\u2019re able to do this is incredible and I hope people can hear that when they listen to our new songs.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":575},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":180},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":180},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":120},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":120},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-og.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":766},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":60},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":60},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":299},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":299},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":389},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/75/61-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":389}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://pepperlive.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pepperlive\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/pepperlive\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"pepperlive\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1376646?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
