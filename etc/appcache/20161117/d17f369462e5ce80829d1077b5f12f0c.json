At the time, he was living in Florida and writing the material that would become his debut record, \\\"Having To Let Go.\\\" After nearly five years, two records, the addition of a full band and constant touring, Ryan Dunson and the rest of the guys don't believe that they have accomplished enough. The full band, now out of Fayetteville, North Carolina, consists of Dunson, Mike Kamerman (guitar), Pat Murphy (bass), Brandon Schade (guitarist), and David Whitney (drums).\\n\\nIn the same year that Rookie of the Year began, the band signed with Orlando, Florida's One Eleven Records after catching the ear of owner Brad Fischetti. In 2005, One Eleven re-released their debut record, \\\"Having To Let Go\\\" and the band began writing their sophomore album. The band chose producers Ed Rose and Matthew Malpass to produce their second album, \\\"The Goodnight Moon,\\\" which was released on April 11th, 2006. The record has sold over 10,000 copies and has helped the band secure tours with artists such as Mae, Copeland, Mute Math, Cute Is What We Aim For, The Spill Canvas, Blackpool Lights and the Rocket Summer, just to name a few.\\n\\nRookie of the Year marched into 2007 with great eagerness and excitement. The band has managed to built a rapport with their fans, such that every person who attends show will leave satisfied. Their live show has built some buzz around the fact that it exhibits a raw energy that you would normally only see in a studio setting . It is this buzz that is now generating up to 500 fans per show. Rookie of the Year has a track record of constant touring that dates back to 2002 and even though \\\"The Goodnight Moon\\\" was released over a year ago, the band is showing no signs of slowing down. In fact, they have managed to balance their touring efforts with some down time in order to start writing for their third release, which is due to be released in the spring of 2008 on One Eleven Records. Keep an eye out for an explosion of Rookie of the Year in 2008. This could be your new favorite band.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":400},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":400},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-og.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":400},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":400},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/49/52-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":400}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.rookieoftheyear.net/newsite/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/rookieoftheyear\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/rookieoftheyear\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/rookieoftheyear\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"rookieoftheyear\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1769337,\"name\":\"Jet Black Alley Cat\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Nashville-based band Jet Black Alley Cat formed in mid-2014.

Make music, impact lives for good, and follow your dreams. \\\"Music is what we love. It was never a question of whether or not to play music. This is the way God has given us to love on others and be the example we want others to see\u2026so we started this project and with God's help, we are going to take it to the top,\\\" Matthew quotes without hesitation.\\n\\nThese brothers are not new faces to the music world though.Originally from Wichita, Kansas, their last project \\\"The Lost Colors\\\" received recognition by winning a nationwide battle of the bands that landed them slots on 15+ festivals from San Diego to Atlanta. Not to mention opening for bands such as Hey Monday, Relient K, Breathe Carolina, Emery, RED, and Hawthorne Heights. They have also played multiple warped tour dates, all of this done while being independent of a label.\\n\\nBut what really make these two special are their music and the shows they put on. Matthew has a showmanship while playing the drums that many drummers strive to have. Michael compliments his brothers' passion by giving it his all while he sings and plays keys, occasionally throwing in some dance moves and head banging. If you had to describe a Danger Scene show the words \\\"crazy, fun, creative, and emotional\\\" would come to mind.\\n\\nThey have found that the strongest bond is family and that is what Danger Scene is. Family. Brothers.
