It was time to move forward and take full control of their career by launching their own label, Palehorse Records.  In addition, the band decided to self-produce their fourth album, Minus the Machine, at drummer/guitarist Brian Vodinh's Kashmir Recording.\\r\\n\\r\\nSplitting up with a major label after five years was \\\"a very scary step to take,\\\" Hasek admits. \\\"It's like breaking up with a longtime girlfriend. You're used to the motions, but when it becomes stale and unhappy, you need to move on and get energy back into your life. There was no anger on either side. We just painlessly parted ways.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nWorking together as a band for the first time since writing the Gold-selling album The Autumn Effect helped 10 Years go back to their roots, without label-enforced pressure to create a radio-friendly \\\"hit,\\\" and free to experiment with the hard rock sounds that lie at the core of their music. \\\"Our true fans who buy the albums, not just the singles, understand that our singles, for the most part, misrepresent the entire album,\\\" says Hasek. \\\"As a band, we like to explore more and go a little left of center with song structures. We wanted to create an album that has no boundaries, and where we didn't have to make every song 'three minutes and 30 seconds' for a label to approve it. There's a fine line with that, of course, and we're very aware of it. We all grew up on rock music, and as many albums as we've written, the way we've written them, it's ingrained in us to work within a time frame that fits radio. There are definitely songs that work well for that, but as a whole, we wanted this album to represent a journey in a sense.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThis chapter of 10 Years began in 2001, when Hasek took over as vocalist. Three years later they released their independent album, Killing All That Holds You, featuring the groundbreaking single \\\"Wasteland,\\\" which led to their signing with Universal Records. \\\"That song was created in 2001 or 2002,\\\" says Hasek. \\\"We weren't seeking to write a smash single. We were just writing music.\\\" The Autumn Effect (2005) led to widespread radio and video play, a fiercely loyal fan base, and tours with heavyweights like Linkin Park, Korn and the Deftones. When their sophomore effort, Division, was released in 2008, 10 Years had cemented their place as one of hard rock's top contenders and most sought-after live bands. Still, says Hasek, despite the success, \\\"it all came to a head\\\" with the band's 3rd major label release, Feeding The Wolves. \\\"When you feel like you're being told to go through motions and jump through hoops, it takes the heart out of it,\\\" he says. \\\"We know that we need a hit and we understand that it's important. However, as musicians, we're not a band that says, 'We're going to make a hit.' It's better to do what comes naturally and then figure out the after-effect.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that in mind, 10 Years created their most powerful songs to date for Minus The Machine, with Hasek again relying on personal experiences for his lyrics. \\\"Everyone asks about my inspiration for lyrics, and the best thing I can give them is a very generic answer: life,\\\" he says. \\\"Life is the experience \u2014 it's everything you go through: the ups, the downs. I tend to gravitate more toward the therapy method. I'm not great at writing happy pop songs. So, I usually get the negative emotions out through music. As a person, I'm very happy and thankful for my life, but when it comes to lyrics, it's therapy for me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that won't change is 10 Years' connection with their fans. With the release of Minus The Machine, the band is looking forward to hitting the road, performing in close contact with their dedicated audience. \\\"After the last touring cycle, we realized where we should strive to be, and that's to be totally fine in the club environment,\\\" says Hasek. \\\"We don't plan to chase after arena rock or amphitheaters. If things like that happen, then so be it, but we live and die by the loyalty of the club audiences. Our fans are loyal. They travel with us, and they want us to be loyal to ourselves. That's what keeps them coming back. What we tried to do on this album is really give them what they want and what they need because they've been so good to us through the ups and downs of our career.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"First and foremost, when it's all said and done, we're proud of this album in its entirety,\\\" he says. \\\"That speaks volumes to us because we're our own worst critics. We pick everything apart. An album is your child, it's your baby, and you know it better than anyone. To sit back and be 100 percent proud of what we've accomplished is so gratifying, and we think everything else will fall into place. We hope that everyone will enjoy what we've tried to do.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":658,\"height\":505},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":658,\"height\":505},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":230},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":153},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-og.jpg\",\"width\":658,\"height\":505},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":77},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":384},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":499},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/02/46-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"OPXUeeFXc90\",\"title\":\"10 Years - Wasteland\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OPXUeeFXc90\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OPXUeeFXc90\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://10yearsmusic.com/wordpress/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/kode9\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/10yearsmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/10years\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"10years\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1771266,\"name\":\"Big Jesus\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Fascinating things can happen when a hard alternative rock band explores its dreamy side. The result is BIG JESUS\u2019 \u2018Oneiric\u2019 (pronounced \u014d-\u02c8n\u012b-rik), which means \u201crelating to dreams or dreaming.\u201d BIG JESUS contrasts loud and heavy fuzz-laden tones with soft, pop-melodic vocals to create their own unique brand of music. The result is ethereal rock n\u2019 roll that\u2019s multi-faceted and powerful: Loud and soft; bludgeoning and dreamy; progressive and classic\u2026all at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBIG JESUS\u2019 eclectic sound stems from their surroundings and their upbringing in the Atlanta, GA music scene. \u201cWe grew up in the Atlanta punk/hardcore/metal scene, and that has a big influence on us, musically and philosophically,\u201d explains guitarist C.J. Ridings. Lead singer/bassist Spencer Ussery continues, \u201cWe grew up on the popular rock music of the 90s, and we\u2019re greatly impacted by everything from metal, psychedelic pop, shoegaze, hip hop, and even classical piano music.\u201d Rounding out the band are guitarist Thomas Gonzalez and drummer Joe Sweat.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn BIG JESUS\u2019 upcoming Mascot Label Group debut, Oneiric, the band showcases six brand new songs and four previously self-released tunes, which have been remixed and rerecorded. The result is a trippy group of lush, accessible songs with the surreal feel of a Fellini film.\\r\\n\\r\\nOneiric was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Matt Hyde (Deftones, Slayer, Monster Magnet, Sum 41, Alkaline Trio, etc.). Of the recording, Ridings says, \u201cWorking with Matt was fun and amazing. It was an experience I never would have dreamed I'd get to do. Matt totally understood our band and what we wanted to create.\u201d Ussery continues, \u201cWorking with Matt in Los Angeles was incredible. He knew exactly what was needed from us in order to make the best of the songs in the end, and the final product is something that we are all extremely proud of.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nBIG JESUS originally formed in 2009 through Atlanta\u2019s alternative rock music scene. Ridings explains, \u201dI had the idea to create a band with some friends in my spare time, just for fun. The idea was to just record a few songs and put them online for free. So I made this demo of a song one day where I played all the instruments and then sent it to a few people. I'm a terrible singer, so finding that was my first priority, and Spencer was my immediate thought of who to ask. We ended up getting together with a drummer friend of ours and re-recorded the demo with Spencer singing, got a couple other friends involved, and eventually made a little 4 song EP to put up online in 2011. From there, it just kind of snowballed to taking it more and more seriously. From the EP, people wanted us to play some small local shows, then we got asked to open some bigger shows, then that drove us to make an album of new songs, then that got us a record deal, bigger shows, etc. Now, in 2016, this band has become my absolute top priority and through the process, Spencer has become one of my closest friends and an amazing person to collaborate with.\u201d Ussery adds, \u201cCJ and I had met several years prior, playing shows together with our different Atlanta bands. Over the course of writing and recording a few demos for fun, we started to flesh out a solid lineup of talented guys to play with us. Through several lineup changes, and CJ and I switching guitar and bass duty, we landed on our current lineup with Tommy on lead guitar and Joe on the drums.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band is somewhat cryptic when asked to explain meanings behind their songs, instead preferring their audience to form its own opinions of what each song is about. Blending yin with yang, heavy with soft, can produce the most alluring results. Such is the music of BIG JESUS. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first cut on the album, \u201cSP,\u201d starts off right away energetically, with big guitars. Its heavy beat with melodic vocals sweeping over it gives it an almost psychedelic feel. \u201cTime bends away/It\u2019s such a shame to hear you say/Leave your thoughts at the door/Don\u2019t think, put your mind away/Let it all fade.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next track, \u201cAlways,\u201d is heavy and anthemic, with crunchy guitars and a strong rhythm section driving the tune throughout. \u201cSome sleight of hand lights up your eyes/Some treaded thought to lay beside/Always sleepless thinking of it/Always.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cLock & Key\u201d is reminiscent of some of the biggest hits in \u201890s alternative rock, with its soft beginning, which crescendos into fuzzy guitar tricks and bombastic, harmonious vocals. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me loveless/Your lock hangs there looming/Don\u2019t leave me loveless.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthemic power ballad \u201cFader\u201d draws us in with trippy, deft guitar and bass work, a steady, rolling drumbeat, and alluring, sweeping vocals that suck you into a dreamscape. \u201cOneiric undertones to what I know is real/Dream-like, there in the light/It\u2019s hard believing still/I don\u2019t want to go back/I don\u2019t want to go back to knowing what it\u2019s like on my own.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBIG JESUS believes this new album shows how their song craft has matured. \u201cOneiric sees us as more mature songwriters overall,\u201d Ussery reveals. \u201cAfter years of playing together, we\u2019ve gotten to be quite effective in communicating our ideas to each other. It takes less time for us to compile the arrangements of our material into something we\u2019re proud of. We\u2019ve also had several years of new experiences to pull influence from both sonically and lyrically and conceptually. We\u2019re just smarter musicians than we were in 2013 when we self-released our first record.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BIG JESUS live show experience is one not to be missed. Ridings promises, \u201cWe\u2019re four guys on a stage, playing music as loud and as crushing as possible. We want you to feel the riffs in your gut.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nBIG JESUS isn\u2019t flashy, and they aren't trying to be overnight rock stars. They simply are who they are, and they want you to take a ride with them on their heavy, dreamy musical journey\u2026 and maybe lose your hearing at the same time.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/24-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/04e70BB4D-o\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thebigjesus.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/bigassjesus\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bigassjesus\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bigassjesus\"},{\"id\":1771267,\"name\":\"Realm\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atjmbo.jpeg\",\"width\":720,\"height\":720},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atjmbo1.jpeg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atlg.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atlg1.jpeg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atmd.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atmd1.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-og.jpeg\",\"width\":720,\"height\":720},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atsm.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atsm1.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-sq.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-sqsm.jpeg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atxl.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atxxl.jpeg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/05/35-atxxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.treesdallas.com/event/1383319?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
