Blazing her way on an accelerated career path \u2013 she went from waiting tables in a Philadelphia coffee shop straight to a debut album and a national tour with Robert Plant, Alison Krauss and T Bone Burnett \u2013 Sharon was exposed to many forces pulling at her, offering advice, direction, and often, confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaper Doll is Sharon\u2019s manifesto that she be judged on what she offers through her music, and not by the outfits she wears or who she\u2019s been dating. She delivers this message through songs that effortlessly fuse pop, rock, R&B, and even a taste of electronic music in a direct, emotionally potent style,\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Sharon explains, \u201cIt often seems that female artists have to look and act in a certain way in order to be successful \u2013 like they\u2019re paper dolls and society or \u2018the business\u2019 just slaps these images on them. We have these young girls acting and dressing in a very overly-sexual way; like they\u2019re grown women \u2013 is that their idea, or have they been told to look and act that way in order to sell themselves? Either way, it\u2019s just sad. I thought we women were supposed to have made great strides in the past several decades. Spending ten minutes on a few popular websites makes me feel like we\u2019ve only gone backward.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Grammy winner Don Was \u2013 noted for his work on chart-topping albums by the Rolling Stones and Bonnie Raitt, among many others \u2013 the Philadelphia-bred artist\u2019s sophomore release follows her critically-acclaimed 2008 CBS Records debut Perfect Time For A Breakdown. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cPerfect Time\u2026 was the first record I\u2019d ever really done,\u201d she said, \u201cand I didn\u2019t really know quite how to express myself back then. A person\u2019s art is a life of it's own, I am learning every day how to better channel the growth of my music...and, as a result, this album is all me, speaking in my own voice, about my own feelings. I\u2019ve gained confidence about who I am and how to express that with my music.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nThe release of Paper Doll succeeds Little\u2019s triumphant run of shows as the opening act on Robert Plant and Alison Krauss\u2019 2008 U.S. Raising Sand concert tour. She was selected from dozens of acts clamoring for the slot, and Sharon received standing ovations in front of sold-out houses in arenas and amphitheaters across the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt would be an understatement to say it was the most amazing experience ever,\u201d Little says. \u201cI\u2019m speechless from it still! Robert Plant is the nicest guy. T Bone is awesome. Alison Krauss is an angel \u2013 she would roller skate around the stadiums with her son while I was doing sound checks and sing along to my songs.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing that tour and countless other gigs throughout the U.S., Sharon spent months honing the many song ideas she had been developing with her collaborator Scot Sax into a song cycle that became Paper Doll. She explains that along with the album\u2019s examination of an artist finding her place in popular culture, several of its striking compositions \u2013 highlighted by \u201cShake and Shiver,\u201d \u201cIf You Want To See Me Cry\u201d and \u201cGood Goodbye\u201d \u2013 are rooted in the turmoil one often finds in personal relationships. Little chronicles the process of healing the emotional wounds they inflict, observed from a perspective of inner strength and self-awareness. Acknowledging the albums\u2019 roots in her own romantic life, she says with a laugh, \u201cI guess the ups and downs of my personal relationships gave me plenty of musical inspiration when I started thinking about making this record.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWas, who also appears on keyboards and bass, brought focus to the set\u2019s punchy sound. Little says of the producer, \u201cHe truly takes a vision and materializes it. It was the first time I ever worked with somebody who said, \u2018I want to take what you want and make it happen.\u2019 Don was my professional voice. He\u2019s an amazing guy, and he\u2019s such a great musician.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nPaper Doll arrives after a busy two years for Little. Her music has been ubiquitous on television: the opening track from Perfect Time\u2026, \u201cFollow That Sound,\u201d became the theme for The Cleaner on A&E, and she sang that song on-camera in one memorable episode. She performed another track from that album, \u201cSpaceship,\u201d in a sequence shot in New York\u2019s 34th Street subway station for an episode of CSI: NY, and her songs have also been featured on NCIS, The Good Wife, Ghost Whisperer, and NUMB3RS,.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle\u2019s deep and soulful sound is the product of experience. She says she wasn\u2019t exposed to much pop music growing up in a large blue-collar family: She seldom listened to the radio, and didn\u2019t see a TV until she was 11. She received her first guitar at 16: When her closest childhood friend was killed in a tragic car accident, the girl\u2019s mother gave Little the instrument as a gift. \u201cI found myself channeling the pain and grief I was going through, with my voice and my guitar,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s where my soul was born.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of miles and hundreds of gigs later, Sharon Little is making music with a newfound poise that rings clearly in every note of Paper Doll. She says of her journey, \u201cThree years ago, I had never been in any states besides Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Texas, and now, I\u2019ve been to every state in this country except three. I\u2019ve met countless artists who\u2019ve inspired me greatly, and my music has been heard all over TV. I\u2019ve got a lot of people behind me, helping me to achieve my dream to be a true artist, and I hope to show aspiring young artists that they, too, can achieve their dreams without compromising who they really are.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-og.jpg\",\"width\":1500,\"height\":1500},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/54/55-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.sharonlittle.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/sharonlittle\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/sharonlittlemusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/sharonlittle\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"sharonlittle\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://tinangel.com/event/1328659?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
