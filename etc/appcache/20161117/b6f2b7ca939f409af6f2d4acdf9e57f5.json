a lot of shit I done been through/But all that I can do is continue.\u201d \u2013 Wax, \u201cContinue\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nContinue\u2026 is more than just a name for the new album from L.A.-based emcee Wax. It\u2019s a declaration \u2014 one that lets everybody know that after a few detours he is excited to move forward to the next phase of his career.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout those detours\u2026 After five years fronting and playing guitar for touring act MacGregor from 2000 to 2005, Wax and his twin brother, Herbal T, started posting videos to You Tube. Utilizing Wax\u2019s humor, penchant for infectious hooks and skill at writing, rapping, producing and arranging, the videos made him a rising star on the site. The 30 million plus views on You Tube earned him the dream of every aspiring rapper, a contract with Def Jam in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the culmination of a decade\u2019s worth of work, a decade that had earned him a solid reputation and a devoted fan base. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve developed a friendship with my fans,\u201d he says of his loyal followers who tune in regularly to hear his weekly podcast, where he opens up about himself about all subjects.\\r\\n\u201cI think people appreciate I let them in,\u201d he says of why his admirers are so devoted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a seemingly perfect scenario for both Wax and the label, he got to work with industry greats and be home to hip-hop royalty. They brought in an artist that had a built-in following of millions. Unfortunately the relationship didn\u2019t work out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cGenerally as a person I used to be really happy, especially once I didn\u2019t have to work a regular job and I could just do music and be creative,\u201d he says. \u201cThen you just get locked into this box, I started to get depressed and I didn\u2019t really know why and then I started to realize what makes me happy is making the music. Not because it makes money and not because it makes me some kind of superstar, I just like doing it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDropped by Def Jam, it turned out to be the best thing for the artist, who got to continue using the relationships he established there while making the album he wanted to make. With a mix of long-time friends like EOM and people he met through Def Jam like Supa Dups (Eminem), Wax has crafted an eclectic, impressive collection that displays his full range.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish-tinged viral smash \u201cRosana\u201d is an engaging hybrid of pop and Mariachi, while the humorously venomous \u201cShe Used To Be Mine\u201d features a fast-paced punkish energy. He goes the opposite route with the soulful rhythms of the slow jam \u201cStupified,\u201d one of four tracks produced by Greg Wells.\\r\\n\\r\\nIronically, one of Def Jam\u2019s concerns was the lack of a radio single. But Continue\u2026 is laced with them, starting with \u201cRosana,\u201d whose video has drawn over four million views for its blend of humor, a catchy chorus and a gorgeous woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have put it on the album but I think just because of people that were attracted from that song we\u2019re gonna put it on there,\u201d he says of the song. \u201cRosana\u201d is hardly the only radio ready joint on the album though. The exuberant dance energy of \u201cOutta My Mind\u201d screams to be blasted at full volume from headphones, car speakers and stores. Again showing his versatility though, Wax then goes for a down and dirty riff on the intro to the slightly bluesy \u201cGet It In\u201d and on the confessional \u201cTomorrow\u201d he turns his past partying into a fun sing-along ditty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key to the song\u2019s success is the way he can poke fun at himself. \u201cI\u2019ll probably end up living like Rick James in the \u201880s,\u201d he sings at one point. And all of this partying happened. \u201cI take stuff that really happened and I\u2019ll exaggerate it for comic purposes, but it\u2019s all based on stuff that really happened. Funny shit happens to me,\u201d he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nWax draws heavily on his love of comedy. \u201cI kind of write from the same way a comedian writes,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m definitely influenced by comedy, even more so now than I was when I was a kid. As far as old-school comedians probably my favorites are Eddie Murphy, I like Chris Rock, I really like Bill Burr, he\u2019s kind of newer, but he\u2019s one of my favorites now.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\u2019s no question a great part of Wax\u2019s internet appeal is his ability to infuse humor into everything he does. But this is no novelty act. A gifted musician who started playing guitar at age ten, he found the right people to bring out his musicality on Continue\u2026 Among those lending their talents to the album are EOM, Supa Dups (Eminem), King David and Greg Wells (Adele, Katy Perry, Ozzy Osbourne, Aerosmith). The multiple Grammy nominated Wells is one of the producers Wax met through Def Jam, for which Wax is very grateful to his former label.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThey introduced me to some very talented producers, people I wouldn\u2019t have been able to work with without them,\u201d he says. \u201cI give Def Jam credit forever for introducing me to so many people.\u201d\\r\\nThat\u2019s particularly true of Wells, of whom Wax points out, \u201cAs far as I know he\u2019s never made a song with any other rapper ever.\u201d Working with the veteran producer Wax learned a great deal.\\r\\n\u201cWhen I first started working with Greg Wells me and my manager came to the studio as we always do and the first thing he did is like, \u2018Yo, you can\u2019t be here to my manager,\u2019\u201d Wax recalls. \u201cThe only people allowed in the room are him, people who are working on the song technically, his engineer obviously has got to be there. Greg is older than me and it comes from experience. One thing I learned from him is if there\u2019s a way that you\u2019re comfortable, fuck everybody else, get into that way.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a lot of lessons that went into Continue\u2026 If it\u2019s taken a year longer than expected to get here that\u2019s alright, because Wax isn\u2019t looking for a quick fix or to capitalize on a bit of momentum. As someone who\u2019s wanted to make music since he saw MTV at the age of three, he\u2019s looking at this as something he\u2019ll be doing all his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be somebody who just does one big thing and that\u2019s it,\u201d he says. \u201cLongevity is important because I love what I do. And I will express myself honestly for as long as people will listen.\u201d With Continue\u2026 Wax proves unquestionably he has the skills to be around for a very long time.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":620,\"height\":500},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":620,\"height\":500},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":242},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":161},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-og.jpg\",\"width\":620,\"height\":500},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":81},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":403},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":620,\"height\":500},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/84/67-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.waxdotcom.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/waxdotcom/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bigwax\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bigwax\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1766335,\"name\":\"Freesole\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1766336,\"name\":\"Ace 94'\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1770242,\"name\":\"Psych Finito\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.subt.net/event/1338707?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
