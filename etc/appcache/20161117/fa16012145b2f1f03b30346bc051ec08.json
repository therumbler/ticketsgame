Beats\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Danny Lee Blackwell \u2013 guitar / vocals\\r\\nJakob Bowden \u2014 bass\\r\\nJames Traeger \u2014 drums\\r\\n\\r\\nNight Beats play pure psychedelic R&B music that spikes the punch and drowns your third eye in sonic waves of colour. Theirs is a bastard blues, contorted and distorted into new shapes for 21st century wastoids \u2014 once tasted never forgotten. This is music to melt your sorry little minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake no mistake: their new album Who Sold My Generation sounds like it has been created against a backdrop of burning Stars and Stripes flags and with the whiff of napalm hanging in the air \u2014 an alternative universe where \u2018Helter Skelter\u2019 is the national anthem and Charlie Manson is still on the loose. Acid-test heaviness is Night Beats\u2019 currency, but this is no out-right nostalgia trip either. Instead of Nixon and Vietnam, Night Beats have their own epoch of God and guns and bombs and drones to rail against\u2026or flee from. Besides, bad vibrations, blues jams and id-shattering explorations are timeless pursuits \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t today\u2019s young generation be allowed to take a ride down the slippery spiral that sits within the centre of each of us?\\r\\n\\r\\nOn their third album \u2013 and first for Heavenly Recordings \u2014 Night Beats perhaps most recall their Texan forefathers and psyche-rock originators 13th Floor Elevators at their \u201869 peak, just before The Man busted young Roky Erickson and dragged him to the psyche ward for barbaric doses of shock treatment. These boys represent the best of the Lone Star State\u2019s flipside \u2013 that vast dusty hinterland of the soul where it\u2019s easy to drift off the map and reinvent yourself as part of the long lineage of creative cowboys who prefer psychotropics to rodeo riding, guitars rather than firearms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cOld cowboy culture is alive and well in Texas,\u201d says frontman Danny Lee Blackwell. \u201cI grew up with Texan mythology all around us, so as a band its instilled in our blood. My Dad didn\u2019t wrangle steers but he did pick cotton when he was young. But then cities like Austin and Dallas, where we spent most of our time growing up, have a real sense of musical history that runs deep, so we feed off legacy that too.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the Elevators and The Red Krayola on to pre-ZZ Top band The Moving Sidewalks, Butthole Surfers and The Black Angels \u2013 whose record label Reverb Appreciation Society have released Night Beats \u2014 and a clutch of other early cult bands besides (Bubble Puppy, Shiva\u2019s Headband and the Golden Dawn, anyone?), Texas has always been a prime breeding ground for such outlaw music. \u201cThe Elevators were one of the reasons I decided to become a singer and form the group,\u201d says Blackwell. \u201cI loved their attempt to play R \u2018n\u2019 B music, but from a distinctly Texan approach. I\u2019d say they have profoundly influenced the group, but it\u2019s now our job to take it to another level in a new age.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took a cross-country relocation to instigate their formation. Night Beats were born when frontman Danny Lee Blackwell upped stick from Dallas to Seattle, Washington and was soon joined by childhood friend James Traeger. \u201cJames got me a copy of Ginsberg\u2019s Howl when I was around 15 and it changed everything,\u201d remembers Blackwell of his old friend. \u201cWe grew up together and once he moved up to Seattle we did everything together there too. I wanted to try out a different place, a new city, where no one knew my music and there wasn\u2019t anything remotely similar going on. Coming from Dallas, Austin seemed like the obvious choice but I needed something more. Seattle was at one time the home to people we love like Ray Charles, Jimi Hendrix and Quincy Jones so I didn\u2019t feel too disconnected.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two existed initially as a guitar and drums duo, named in honour of Sam Cooke\u2019s 1963 album Night Beat, before fellow Jakob Bowden Dallas resident joined on bass after a stint in Austin. Filtering a collective love of pioneering artists as disparate as Buddy Holly, Fela Kuti, Etta James, James Brown and Leonard Cohen, Night Beats dropped a clutch of singles, split-singles, cassette release and two albums \u2013 their self-titled debut in 2011 followed by Sonic Bloom in 2013 \u2013 as well as featuring on all manner of compilation albums that document the cutting edge of the head-bending, modern counter-cultural US underground.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight Beats hit the road too, touring extensively with Roky Erickson, The Zombies, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Strange Boys, Black Lips, The Growlers and The Black Angels in North America, Europe, Israel, South Africa and Australia.\\r\\nRecorded on old two-inch tape in Echo Park, Los Angeles at the home of producer Nic Jodoin and featuring co-production and guess bass playing from Robert Levon Been of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, new album Who Sold My Generation goes beyond merely being a retreading of well-worn garage / R&B path. Instead it offers a contemporary take on the psychedelic experience, a heady set of hoodoo voodoo songs. Mordant and corrosive opener \u2018Celebration #1\u2019 sets the tone with its wailing guitar jams and Messiah-like monologue, while \u2018No Cops\u2019 makes like the imaginary soundtrack to an orgiastic party somewhere in the LA hills as the summer of love gave way to an era of greed and paranoia. \u2018Sunday Mourning\u2019 is the sound of blood dripping on the twitching remains of a generation\u2019s super ego and with a rockabilly strut, \u2018Egypt Berry\u2019 chases the White Rabbit down into a cosmic underworld while shaking its burning tail feathers\\r\\nWith new Who Sold My Generation, Night Beats have not only painted it black, they\u2019ve torched the fucker and driven it off the cliff, crashing and burning into the arid canyon below.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its afterglow only the lone howl of a solitary coyote remains.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen Myers.

You remember him, right? The ancient god, the child eater, the demander of sacrifice, the villain in Ginsberg\u2019s Howl(and also real life) and now the personal antagonist of singer and songwriter Lucas Fitzsimons, who named his band the Molochs because he knew he\u2019d have to make sacrifices to get what he needed, and because he always wanted a reminder of the Ginsbergian monster he\u2019d be fighting against. And so this is how you make a record right now: you fight for every piece, and when Moloch takes apart your relationships and career potential and leaves you sleeping on couches or living in terrifying apartments and just about depleted from awful people involving you in their awful decisions, you grab a bottle of wine (and laugh at the clich\u00e9) and put together another song. And once you do that eleven hard-won times in total, you get a record like America\u2019s Velvet Glory: honest, urgent, desperate and fearless because of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFitzsimons came to his calling in an appropriately mythic way, born in a historic city not far from Buenos Aires and raised in L.A.\u2019s South Bay\u2014just outside of Inglewood\u2014where he was immersed in the hip-hop hits on local radio. (Westside Connection!) The summer d before he started middle school, a close friend got an electric guitar, and Fitzsimons felt an enirresistible inexplicable power: \u201cI'd go back home and I\u2019d look up guitar chords on the internet\u2014even though I had no guitar\u2014and just imagine how I WOULD play them. I was slowly getting obsessed.\u201d When he was 12, his parents took him back to Argentina, and on the first night, he discovered a long-forgotten almost-broken classical guitar in the basement of his ancestral home: \u201cIt sounds made-up, but it\u2019s true,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn't put the guitar down once that whole trip\u2014took it with me everywhere and played and played. When I got back to L.A., I bought my first guitar practically as the plane was landing.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis started a long line of bands and a long experience of learning to perform in public, as Fitzsimons honed intentions and ideas and tried to figure out why that guitar seemed so important. After a trip to India in 2012, he returned renewed and ready to start again, scrapping his band to lead something new and uncompromising. This was the true start of the Molochs: \u201cIt didn't make any sense to not do everything exactly the way I wanted to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so shy and introverted that singing publicly sounded like a nightmare come true. But I didn't have a choice\u2014I heard something inside of me and I needed to be the one to express it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first album Forgetter Blues was released with Fitzsimons\u2019 guitarist/organist and longtime bandmate Ryan Foster in early 2013 on his own label\u2014named after a slightly infamous intersection in their then-home of Long Beach\u2014and was twelve songs of anxious garage-y proto-punk-y folk-y rock, Modern Lovers demos and Velvet Underground arcana as fuel and foundation both. It deserved to go farther than it did, which sadly wasn\u2019t very far. But it sharpened Fitzsimons and his songwriting, and after three pent-up years of creativity, he was ready to burst. So he decided to record a new album in the spirit of the first, and in the spirit of everything that the Molochs made so far: \u201cI wanted to spend less time figuring out HOW we were gonna do something and just actually do it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result is America\u2019s Velvet Glory, recorded with engineer Jonny Bell at effortless (says Fitzsimons) sessions at Long Beach\u2019s JazzCats studio. (Also incubator for Molochs\u2019 new labelmates Wall of Death and Hanni El Khatib.) It starts with an anxious electric minor-key melody and ends on a last lonesome unresolved organ riff, and in between comes beauty, doubt, loss, hate and even a moments or two of peace. There are flashes of 60s garage rock\u2014like the Sunset Strip \u201966 stormer \u201cNo More Cryin\u2019\u201d or the \u201cLittle Black Egg\u201d-style heartwarmer-slash-breaker \u201cThe One I Love\u201d\u2014but like one of Foster\u2019s and Fitzsimons\u2019 favorites the Jacobites, the Molochs are taking the past apart, not trying to recreate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can hear where songs bend, where voices break, where guitars start to shiver and when strings are about to snap; on \u201cYou And Me,\u201d you can almost hear Lou Reed\u2019s ghost call for a solo, and on \u201cI Don\u2019t Love You,\u201d you get that subway-sound guitar and find out what happens when Jonathan Richman\u2019s G-I-R-L-F-R-E-N goes wrong. And of course there\u2019s the charismatic chaos of bootleg basement-tape Dylan\u2014always Dylan, says Fitzsimons\u2014and the locked-room psychedelia of Syd Barrett, especially on \u201cCharlie\u2019s Lips,\u201d Fitzsimons\u2019 ode to\u2014or antidote to\u2014those times when he felt the bleakness completely: \u201cThen a bird lands on a branch nearby, you hear leaves fluttering, you hear a child laughing \u2026 all of a sudden things don't seem so bad anymore.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Moloch might still be out there, devouring his sacrifices, but the Molochs are still fighting, too. And that\u2019s why Fitzsimons picked the band name\u2014it\u2019s so he remembers what he\u2019s up against. He\u2019s not celebrating the destroyer of youth and individuality and creativity, he says: \u201cI\u2019m just keeping him in sight so that he doesn't win.\u201d \u2013 Christopher Ziegler\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1051},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":328},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":219},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-og.jpg\",\"width\":1871,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":109},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":547},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":711},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/74/64-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"O5S4OoA5bi8\",\"title\":\"The Molochs - June\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5S4OoA5bi8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"3kACcM9twBA\",\"title\":\"THE MOLOCHS\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3kACcM9twBA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5S4OoA5bi8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://themolochs.bandcamp.com/album/forgetter-blues-lp\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/themolochs/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1364541?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
