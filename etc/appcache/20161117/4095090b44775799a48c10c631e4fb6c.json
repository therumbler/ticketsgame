Lanez\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"If, in the title of Tory Lanez\u2019 new album, I Told You, you think you read a triumphal tone on the singer-rapper\u2019s part, you are not mistaken. \u201cSaying \u2018I told you\u2019 is for the people who didn\u2019t believe, who thought my dream was so unrealistic that it was impossible. Being homeless, having the teachers tell me I couldn\u2019t do things, having people say \u2018That celebrity life doesn\u2019t happen for people from around here\u2019 \u2014 all of those things are what fueled where we\u2019re at right now. It\u2019s like, bro, I told you guys. And I\u2019m not done telling you guys.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe\u2019s been telling us for years, actually, in the form of so many singles, mixtapes, and collaborations that it seems impossible we\u2019re just now hearing the name Tory Lanez and \u201cdebut album\u201d in the same sentence. I Told You is the 24-year-old\u2019s first proper album \u2014 and his first release with Interscope and Mad Love, producer/mentor Benny Blanco\u2019s label. But it\u2019s the culmination of year after year of high-profile projects that have already made him a near-household name in R&B and hip-hop. If it\u2019s possible to be both a freshman and a wisened veteran all at once, that\u2019s Tory Lanez.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the commercial realm, he staked a claim in early 2015 with the platinum single \u201cSay It,\u201d which reached the top of the rhythmic and urban radio charts and, as a pop crossover contender, hit No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100. Among the intelligentsia, though, Lanez is famous for the 15 mixtapes he\u2019s released since coming on the scene in 2009, including Conflicts of My Soul, three installments in the notorious Chixtape series, and The New Toronto, named for his hometown, which is suddenly looking like the hottest hip-hop breeding ground no one anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of those mixtapes concentrated on an aspect of Lanez\u2019 real life, be it his troubled family life, contemporary social commentary, or, as the titles indicated, chicks. But all those strains finally come together in I Told You, which will serve as either an introduction or a summarizing opus, depending on the listener. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve treated all my mixtapes as albums,\u201d Lanez says, \u201cand I\u2019ve treated all those projects cinematically. But this album specifically is a movie. It\u2019s the one where the stories from all the other tapes become one gigantic story, if you listen to it in its entirety. This is the first time you get the love story and the grit and the glamour.\u201d If the mixtapes were like Godfather installments, \u201cthis is The Godfather Epic.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s all about changing Lanez. \u201cYou get the real \u2018I got nowhere to go\u2019 story. You get the real \u2018Me and my girl, we\u2019re going through it\u2019 and the real \u2018He was really putting in work on the street\u2019 and the \u2018Wow, this kid\u2019s life really changed from negative to positive while he was trying to chase his dream.\u2019 And I feel like everybody can relate to at least part of  \u2014 as a boy, as a girl, as a white man, as a black man, as anybody \u2014as a true underdog story.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides \u201cSay It,\u201d the new album also includes the recently released singles \u201cLuv,\u201d \u201cCold Hard Love\u201d and \u201cFlex\u201d as well as provocative gap-fillers in the Lanez narrative like \u201cFriends With Benefits\u201d and \u201cLoners Blvd.\u201d One thing you won\u2019t find anywhere in the track listing for I Told You, though: \u201cfeaturing,\u201d an F-word Lanez wasn\u2019t particularly enamored of during the making of the album.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI don\u2019t need features,\u201d he says. \u201cIn life, I would rather in life that we have some organic reasoning going into why we want to make music with each other. I don\u2019t want to be forced into situations with people. When I couldn\u2019t sing, that\u2019s when I needed features! But I taught myself how to sing, because of the fact that I wasn\u2019t able to get a singer on my song all the time. I don\u2019t need anybody to write anything for me, because I wrote some of the hottest songs and I don\u2019t want anybody to take that away from me. The music means more to me than the name. If this is the first time you ever hear me, I want you to know authentically that this is all me.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, he became more than just a novice singer. \u201cI could rap to you all day and I say the most astonishing lines, and we could talk about how clever this line or that is. But nothing hits you in your soul like when a melody is such a good melody you can\u2019t stop singing it.\u201d What style is it? \u201cThe genre of music I\u2019m doing is swavey music,\u201d he says. He may have coined the term, but he doesn\u2019t claim to have a premium on it. \u201cThe top artists in the game do swavey music \u2014 people like Nicki Minaj; Lil Wayne, when he was doing rock and hip-hop and pop \u2014 these are all swavey artists. It\u2019s just a word that encases the fact that we fuse more than one or two genres together and create something that\u2019s brand new for the people.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLanez\u2019s reluctance to employ star guests on I Told You doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s unappreciative of the love he\u2019s gotten from some very big names in the past. Pop star Ed Sheeran was so enamored of \u201cSay It\u201d that he recorded a cover version of Lanez\u2019 hit and released it to their mutual fans as a free download. And Lanez first came to the attention of a broad swath of the pop public all the way back in 2010 when Justin Bieber was seen on video rapping some of the lyrics from his mixtape favorite, \u201cBeamer Benz or Bentley (Freestyle).\u201d \u201cEvery time something like that happens,\u201d Lanez says of these celebrity covers, \u201cit reminds me that you don\u2019t have to be in such a rush for things to happen, because your music is strong, and good people and good artists are genuinely gonna fuck with it, and you\u2019re genuinely gonna fuck with them, too\u201d \u2014 in the most positive sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that he doesn\u2019t have designs on supplanting them, or anyone else who might be on top. For Lanez, personal graciousness doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t also prone to making statements like \u201cI want every artist to understand that I\u2019m out here to blow you out of the water\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m coming for the game \u2014 the biggest artists in the world.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI have a vengeance in my heart, but you have to realize my vengeance is because I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve accomplished what I need to accomplish to be king,\u201d he says. \u201cThat fire doesn\u2019t die down. If people take that as \u2018Who the fuck does this guy think he is,\u2019 it\u2019s like, yo, you guys are not able to see what I see. It\u2019s not a cockiness. It\u2019s a confidence of knowing where I\u2019m supposed to be. I\u2019m not an asshole at all! They think that 24 hours of the day, I\u2019m in grrrr mode. The fucked-up, funny thing is that if you meet me in real life, I am the most chill person. If a bum tells me something on the street, I listen. I\u2019ve learned in life to always sit and listen and always have humility. But when you go for what you want, go for what you want, don\u2019t go for half of what you want. The guys who become president weren\u2019t there to be vice president. I\u2019m not here to be No. 2.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat determination was formed when Lanez hit hard times well before he was a teen. Born Daystar Peterson, Lanez faced a tragic loss at age 9. Things got rougher when family estrangements left him completely on his own at age 15. Within a couple of years of that leap into a starker adulthood, he was performing live and garnering attention with his first mixtapes, a move to reclaim his destiny that you can hear traced within the autobiography of I Told You.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust in the year and a half between the breakout success of \u201cSay It\u201d and the release of I Told You, it\u2019s been a whirlwind for Lanez, not all of it remotely related to the creation of his opus. He was the driving force as well as \u201cfeature\u201d on Meek Mill\u2019s \u201cLord Knows,\u201d a highlight of the Creed soundtrack. Lanez co-headlined an acclaimed tour with A$AP Ferg, and did shows in genre-spanning festivals like Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits. On Christmas Day 2015 alone, he released two mixtapes (The New Toronto and Chixtape 3), while priming his fans to regularly expect new material on Fargo Fridays. Lanez booked a massive headlining tour named for I Told You that runs through December. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the outside, all this accomplishment might seem surprising for someone who just turned 24. But ever since he was in 5th or 6th grade, he says, \u201cI always knew, I always knew. Damn \u2014 that might be my next album title.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":450},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":450},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":208},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":138},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-og.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":450},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":69},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":346},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":450},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/28/75-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/torylanez\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/SwaveNation\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ToryLanez\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ToryLanez\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1700089,\"name\":\"Jacquees\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"No matter what you do, you've got to know your roots and Jacquees certainly does. \\n\\n\\\"Who is Jacquees?,\\\" you may be asking. The Atlanta singer and songwriter is cooking up his own smooth, slick, and simmering brand of 21st century R&B with an old school twist.\\n\\n\\\"I grew up listening to some of the greats,\\\" states Jacquees. \\\"My mom would play Jodeci and R. Kelly around the house. You could pull up on the block listening to those cats, and no one would think twice. I want to cause that same reaction. When you listen to my music, it will make you feel like you can roll up on any girl in the world or do anything. It's that 'G' mentality.\\\"\\n\\nJacquees definitely picks up the mantle for the genre, while forging his own way. As a kid, he grew up in what he calls a \\\"really fun family\\\" with two sisters and his mom. Excelling in school, he desired to get straight A's to make his mother proud since she gave him her trust implicitly.  Inspired by such artists as Michael Jackson, The Temptations, Jackson 5, Chris Brown, Jodeci, 2Pac and The Hot Boy$; Jacquees label himself a \\\"Hot Boy$ Head,\\\" he even went out a brought an imitation Cash Money Chain.   \\n\\nJacquees' initially wanted to be a rapper until one day his aunt heard him singing a song from the made for TV movie The Temptations.  \\\"She was like, 'you can sing!'\\\" he recalls. \\\"I got inspired from that moment on, and with encouragement from my mom I signed up for my first school talent show in 2004,\\\" and went on to win the shows for the next 4-years.  In 2007 Jacquees joined Kenny Leon's True Colors Theater Company and was part of the ensemble that danced & sang in the production of the Wiz.  He also played a munchkin and had a solo performance. \\n\\nUpon entering ninth grade in 2008, Jacquees linked up with Block Entertainment [Boyz n da Hood, Yung Joc] and learned the ropes under the tutelage of Jody Breeze.  In 2011 he released his first mix-tape \\\"Round Of Applause;\\\" followed by a series of successful mixtapes including Fan Affiliated in 2012, Quemix in 2013 and Quemix 2 in 2015.  \\\"The first project went crazy,\\\" he recalls. \\\"It's the foundation of my fan base. It was the start of 'Team Jacquees' and the whole movement.\\\"  Jacquees would go on to collaborate with everybody from Jagged Edge & Travis Porter to Lloyd & Chris Brown.\\n\\nIn 2014, he released his first independent debut EP, 19, which landed at #3 on iTunes Top R&B Albums Chart and #15 on Billboard's Top R&B Albums Chart.  With the success the release, Jacquees decided to reach out to fellow rising star frequent collaborator Rich Homie Quan about a meeting with the legendary Cash Money Records Co-C.E.O. Records Bryan \\\"Birdman\\\" Williams.  \\\"Rich Homie Quan and I are like brothers,\\\" he says. \\\"I knew that he was working in the studio with Birdman, I hit him and his dad up and said I was trying to get in touch with Baby. He happened to be with Baby at the time!\\\"\\n\\nBirdman saw the video for Jacquees' swagger-driven soul anthem \\\"Soldier\\\" featuring Rich Homie Quan\u2014which Jacquees even directed\u2014and offered him a deal days later with Cash Money Records and Rich Gang Management. \\\"Soldier\\\" was even included on Rich Gang's unanimously acclaimed mixtape, Tha Tour \u2013 Part 1.\\n\\nStarting 2015 off with a bang, Jacquees released the fan favorite - Quemix 2 mixtape the first week of January and his videos for the singles \\\"Me, U, & Patron,\\\" made a massive impact with clocking over 4 million views and \\\"How Bout Now (Remix)\\\" garnering 2 million-plus views.\\n\\nAs he readies his full-length major label debut on Cash Money Records, Jacquees has one goal in mind\u2014and it doesn't differ much from that of his idols. \\\"I just want people to listen to my music and feel good.\\\" \\\"You know how a certain song will make you remember a certain time?
