began singing for relatives as a toddler. Her gift was nurtured through singing at church and further cultivated through educational experiences. She was a student of Suitland High School for the Visual and Performing Arts and is a graduate of Temple University with a degree in Classical Voice Performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nChartel has been a background singer to BET Music Matters Artist, Leah Smith, joining her on stage at BET\u2019s 106th and Park, The BET Honors, and numerous other stages along the East Coast.

Classically trained, with a firm understanding of how sound effects emotion, she created the movement to inspire artists, and all individuals alike, to make an effort to put ART, in any form, in the fore front and to live each day with the idea that LOVE is the ultimate movement that we should all adopt. The artand\u2764\ufe0fonly concept sparked a musical collaboration with austin purnell, and the butterflyTree collective was born. Ono shortly added producer \\\"Flowerman\\\" (Emiliano Flowerman) and Produder/Drummer \\\"Ignabu\\\" (Cinque Kemp) to solidify her core. Whether performing alone or with the collective, Ono prides herself on creating with chosen artists that understand the mission: to attract some of the most beautiful things created to some of the other beautiful things in the world, through art (with music as the common thread). The sole purpose: to create epically and unforgettably creative pieces of art we couldnt possibly create alone, to empower women, and to promote LOVE above all else.\\r\\nOno has had the opportunity to perform/create with a vast range of artists that include Theophilus London, Tabi Bonney, Awthentik Dwele, Kokayi, Slum Village, Raheem DeVaughn, Phife/Tribe Called Quest, Elvis Costello, Mya, DJ Underdog, Spinser Tracy, Tittsworth, Q-Tip, Phil Ad\u00e9, Jay IDK, Wes Felton, YahZarah, Pete Rock, Wayna, and many more.

He has been involved in many vocal activities throughout his life such as choirs from the age of 5 until the present, and has done a great deal of solo work as well. Zach started playing guitar in high school, which is also when he began creating his own music.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nZach then went on to Easter Illinois University where he studied music for three years. At EIU he was in multiple choirs, and took private lessons every semester. Then he transferred to Columbia College in Chicago, where he is currently attending. The reason why he chose to transfer is because he wanted to explore who he could be as a musician, and discover what it takes to make it in the music business. After taking a few courses he realized it was a perfect fit, and is now beginning to get a solid understanding of the music industry and the work ethic and skills involved in becoming part of the industry. Also, he is currently taking classes in songwriting, pop/jazz arranging and orchestration, and music technology(learning logic and finale). Zach has gained many skills in all of these classes that will help him to write full arrangements of his songs, and then help with the recording process. He has only recently began arranging music for multiple instruments, but he is no rookie when it comes to writing songs. He has been writing his own music for about five years now, and doesn't plan to stop until old age. He is also part of an ensemble at Columbia called Kobi, where he is also one of four singers. Upon graduating, Zach will hit the ground running and apply what he has learned in the previous years. He would like to become a professional performer, and get signed to a major label, and also become a studio musician, and professional songwriter for a studio as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nZach is able to sing across a wide variety of musical genres. The music he most enjoys singing is pop and/or soul music. However he is capable of singing anything from country, to r&b, to classical songs. The majority of Zach's singing career to this day has been singing classical music in voice recitals and choirs, and singing his own songs, as well as pop music in his free time. He intends to reverse these rolls though, and be a pop singer professionally, while singing classical music in his free time.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/zach-wcislo\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/zachzdubswcislo/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/zachjoseph32\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"zachjoseph32\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1384962?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
