and energetic music that combines elements of electro, industrial, ebm, dance, 80's, goth and pop.\\r\\n\\r\\nToronto based Jennifer Parkin is a performer, singer, songwriter, and the creator of electronic music project Ayria. Jennifer Parkin has become a bit of an icon in the underground electronic and industrial music scene with her unique writing, singing and performing style and music with an in-your-face sonic approach that combines electro, synth-pop, industrial, 80's dance, distorted gritty beats and synths, haunting melodies contrasted with angry distorted chanting all wrapped up with pop structures and catchy hooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAyria has been intensively touring across the globe over the past 5 years gaining a very solid reputation for putting on energetic live performances with her keyboardist and electronic drummer in tow! A successful headlining 2011 Spring tour of both the U.S. West & North East this past April. And a full U.S. tour in 2010. Ayria has independently toured Jenn's home country of Canada, and then followed it up by touring the U.S.A and Europe opening for legendary band VNV Nation. Ayria has supported The Cruxshadows on two U.S. tours and a 2 month tour covering Europe & the UK just last year. Ayria has also performed in Japan, Russia and Mexico and played notable festival events such as Dragon*Con in Atlanta in 2009 and 2011, INFEST in the UK in 2010, KINETIK in 2009, as well as TRITON FESTIVAL in NYC in 2010. Ayria has also toured alongside bands: Combichrist, Project Pitchfork, and has played shows with Front Line Assembly and Front 242.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot fitting into any one musical category has allowed Ayria to gain a very broad fan base of underground, goth, electro, industrial, dance, and various underground club scenes as well as appeal to more mainstream audiences. People have referred to Ayria as the darker version of Lady Gaga, or the industrial Madonna. Jenn grew up with strong and dramatic women like Madonna influencing her childhood musical tastes, but was always more a fan of the darker side of music and and fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext up, Jenn is currently finishing up a 4th CD titled \\\"Plastic Makes Perfect\\\" to be released in late 2012. Like the previous release \\\"Hearts For Bullets\\\", the new CD will also be produced in Canada by Sebastian R. Komor (ICON OF COIL, KOMOR KOMMANDO, MELT, ZOMBIE GIRL, etc.). Fans can once again expect a diverse release full of intense danceable and stompy electro songs, with dark melodies and lyrics full of self exploration but a further refined sound as Ayria pushes further ahead to once again create something unique and addictive.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://www.ayria.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/ayria\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Ayria.Official\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ayria\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ayria\"},{\"id\":1057661,\"name\":\"Ego Likeness\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Ego Likeness was created in 1999 by artist Steven Archer, a DC native, and writer Donna Lynch in Baltimore, Maryland.
