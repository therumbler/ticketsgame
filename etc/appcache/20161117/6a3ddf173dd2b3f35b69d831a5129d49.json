Transforming Cohen\u2019s lyrics and simple melodies into complex 4- and 5-part harmonies, Conspiracy of Beards achieves a sound that is both robust and tender. With influences ranging from jazz and gospel, to barbershop and doo-wop, the unique arrangements that choir members create capture all of the emotion and humor of Leonard Cohen\u2019s original music, and inspire audiences to ponder common human experiences like romance, heartbreak, politics, sex, longing, and spirituality.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormed in 2003 through the inspiration of the late performance artist Peter Kadyk, the choir has become an integral part of the San Francisco music scene with performances at Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, The Jewish Music Festival, Cafe Du Nord, Great American Music Hall, San Francisco City Hall and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, as well as dozens of bars, bookstores, galleries, hospices, and various other community centers. The choir has also been featured on several radio programs including NPR\u2019s \u201cWest Coast Live,\u201d \u201cThe California Report,\u201d \u201cWeekend Edition,\u201d KQED, KFOG, KPFA, KALW, KWMR, WFMU, and on PBS television.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a non-profit organization (501c-3) and with a commitment to contributing to civic progress, Conspiracy of Beards also performs in support of many charities, fundraisers, and, other non-profits.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":504},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":504},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":157},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":157},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":105},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":105},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-og.jpg\",\"width\":1176,\"height\":617},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":52},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":52},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":262},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":262},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":341},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/41/62-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":341}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7ZqgGsxjuM\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://conspiracyofbeards.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Conspiracy.O.Beards\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/cobeards\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"cobeards\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1388667,\"name\":\"Sylvie Simmons\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Sylvie Simmons will share personal reflections on her time spent with Leonard Cohen and sing a few of her favorite Leonard Cohen songs.\\r\\n\\r\\n-------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have a reputation for unearthing rare lost gems \u2013 but Sylvie was never lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecorded in 2014, it\u2019s the haunting, magical debut of a singer and writer who\u2019s spent her whole life in music but hasn\u2019t gone public until now. Devendra Banhart calls it \u201cFragile and fearless, direct and poetic, absolutely beautiful.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSylvie Simmons was a young girl when she bought her first guitar in a junk shop. One night she took it onstage and, paralyzed by stage fright, chose to play only at home. For Sylvie home was a malleable concept. Born and raised in London, she had a habit of running away, starting with L.A, where she became a renowned music writer. She went on to write books (Serge Gainsbourg; Neil Young; most recently, Leonard Cohen) and kept on moving, including three years in a tumbledown French chateau.\\r\\n\\r\\nSylvie was living in San Francisco and her guitar in England when an enigmatic Japanese man gave her a ukulele. From the moment she played it, it was love. Ukes continued to appear in her life under mysterious circumstances and she forgot all about her guitar. \u201cI\u2019d always thought of the ukulele as a toy, a little handful of happiness,\u201d Sylvie says, \u201cbut it has a sad, fractured sweetness, like a broken harp, and a modesty; it almost apologizes for being there. And yet these songs kept coming through this tiny instrument with all their heartbreak and truth intact.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first person to hear them was Howe Gelb. He lured her to the Arizona desert and she recorded direct to tape, with Howe and of Giant Sand\u2019s Th\u00f8ger Lund as her band. The sound is dreamy, intimate and timeless \u2013 think Sibyll Baier meets Vashti Bunyan on the soundtrack to a lost David Lynch film.

A tangled criss-crossing of backroads and blue highways denoting place, influence, and trajectory. You can hear it in the deep-roots syncopation, in the dusty folk-stomp and in the biorhythmic pulse that ebbs and thumps throughout his soul-tinged songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Hayes, it\u2019s never been about the destination. It\u2019s always been about the journey: The words on paper, fingers on strings, impromptu dance parties, darkened clubs, late night mysteries, firing synapses, human connection, deeper meaning and the kind of beats that really make a body move. \u201cI got moves the kids ain\u2019t seen,\u201d he sings on \u201cMagic Slim vs. Dynamite.\u201d The smoke-and-sparklers dance party video for the song aptly captures the serious fun of his music.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in New York and raised in North Carolina, Hayes headed for California two decades ago. It was in San Francisco that his career blossomed. But Hayes credits the Carolinas towns like Asheville and Charleston \u2014 places where he first wrote and performed tunes such as \u201cMary Magdelene\u201d \u2014 with imprinting him as an artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nHayes forges songs that, even to the uninitiated, sound like hits. He's been compared to Bill Withers for his rhythmic sense and his soulfulness. His \\\"Powerful Stuff,\\\" got a lot of mileage in a Subaru commercial. \\\"Dream Machine\\\" was re-mixed by DJ Mark Farina, \\\"A Thousand Tiny Pieces\\\" was covered by folk group The Be Good Tanyas, \\\"Fucked Me Right Up\\\" landed on the soundtrack to HBO's \u201cBored to Death.\u201d He has dueted with Aimee Mann, toured with the likes of Ani DiFranco and the Cold War Kids, and his breathlessly sexy slow dance, \\\"When We Fall In,\\\" inspired pop star Justin Timberlake to blog rhapsodic.\\r\\n\\r\\nListening to his songs on recording is one thing, live is another experience altogether. Hayes is at once dynamic and laid back on stage. His ability to be authentic in front of an audience comes, he says, \u201cfrom having just enough of a theater background to realize that being yourself on stage is more interesting than any stereotyped character.\u201d He adds, \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in revealing and stripping down and being open.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musician has covered a lot of ground in his tenure, but now, seven albums in, he shows no sign of slowing. \u201cMusic has changed a lot,\u201d he says of his time in the profession. \u201cYou used to have to spend time with a record. You had to take chances and buy records. They were real objects that took up space in your room. Now we have access to enough music, on our phones, to fill libraries.\u201d So how to stand out among a sea of musical artists? Hayes continues to hone his intoxicating blend of ease, effortless cool and magnetism. There's a definite continuity over the span of his back catalog, which dates to his 1999 debut, A Thousand Tiny Pieces. There\u2019s also a distilling of intention and refining of style. He revisits subject matter \u2014 sex, emotion, universal life experience \u2014 from album to album. \u201cThemes will recycle some,\u201d he says, but Hayes\u2019 approach is more of a spiraling in and deepening of understanding than a simple return.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1428},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":446},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":297},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-og.jpg\",\"width\":1377,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":149},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":744},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":967},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/66/27/03-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe src=\\\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/77620622\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"281\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.seanhayesmusic.com/2010/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/rattlesnakecharm\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/seanhayesmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/seanhayesmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"seanhayesmusic\"},{\"id\":924559,\"name\":\"Tim Cohen (solo)\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Tim Cohen is a San Francisco based musician and visual artist.
