Destroyer\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Virginia extreme sound revolutionaries PIG DESTROYER deliver savage grindcore that is both intentionally confrontational and thoroughly pummeling. PIG DESTROYER formed in 1997, when vocalist J.R. Hayes and Agoraphobic Nosebleed guitarist Scott Hull united in their efforts to create utterly destructive grindcore. As soon as the band, also featuring founding drummer John Evans, began rehearsing, they found that their common musical interests produced intelligent and incendiary compositions. After releasing a self-titled demo, which was met with rousing critical reception, PIG DESTROYER released their first full-length, Explosions in Ward 6. Strongly positive reactions to Explosions in Ward 6 established PIG DESTROYER as one of the best new grind acts to have emerged worldwide in the last decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelapse Records soon signed the band off the strength of Explosions, and in 2001 PIG DESTROYER took listeners on a rampaging journey through an unsettling, psychotic world with their landmark release Prowler In The Yard. Melding an insane musical attack with similarly jarring lyrical prose and an unmatched propensity to incite, Prowler In The Yard hit listeners like a coal-black monolith of nihilism. The record stunned music fans, garnering lavish praise, and became one of the more talked-about extreme music releases in recent history, even breaking into the mainstream metal media despite its brutality. Headlining performances at the 2002 New England Metal and Hardcore Festival and at the 2002 Relapse Records CMJ Showcase, alongside a high-profile set at the Relapse Records Contamination Festival in Philadelphia, cemented PIG DESTROYER's place among the new goliaths of heavy music.\\r\\n\\r\\nPIG DESTROYER then continued work on the follow-up to Prowler In The Yard. In what would turn out to be an exhausting, lengthy creative process, the band assumed the ambitious goal of creating a multi-media monster (CD / Audio-DVD package) with their next album. Terrifyer was released in the fall of 2004, and embodied a frighteningly compelling mix of seething metal, intense grind, and thrash and punk rock. Terrifyer featured 32 minutes of unrelenting sonic battery in addition to the 37-minute Audio-DVD track \\\"Natasha.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2007 release of Phantom Limb, which received acclaim from critics and listeners worldwide, cemented the band's legendary status and showcased the band's versatility with its incursions into sludgier and groovier territory than ever before. Phantom Limb was followed by an extensive US tour that found PIG DESTROYER sharing the stage with Carcass, Suffocation, Misery Index, Genghis Tron, and Car Bomb. In 2009, the band made festival appearances at Hellfest, Maryland Deathfest, CMJ Fest, and Scion Rock Fest, and have since played at numerous other national and international festivals including Hopscotch Fest, Brutal Assault, Damnation Festival, and Phil Anselmo's Housecore Horror Film Fest.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, PIG DESTROYER partnered with new drummer Adam Jarvis (Misery Index) and released Book Burner, their ruthless follow-up to Phantom Limb. Book Burner showcased a return to a rawer, more primitive sound, and featured 19 songs of the band's signature misanthropic grind. 2013 saw PIG DESTROYER release an EP of previously unreleased content through Bandcamp titled Mass and Volume as part of a charity effort, and also saw Adam Jarvis's cousin John Jarvis join PIG DESTROYER as the band's first bass player.The band have also made impressive inroads into more mainstream media \u2013 the one-off single \\\"Octagonal Stairway\\\" was included in Adult Swim's Singles Series, and \\\"The Diplomat\\\" (off of Book Burner) featured prominently in the season three finale of Comedy Central's acclaimed Workaholics. This September, the band are set to reissue a deluxe remixed and remastered 2CD version of their 2001 classic Prowler In The Yard on Relapse, which will include a bounty of previously unreleased music and media. Yet even accounting for the band's more visible successes, what still stands out the most is their fundamental and immaculate musical essence. PIG DESTROYER boil metal down to its muscle, sinew, and bone - razor-sharp guitar, percussive pummeling, throbbing bass, and a lone, stark howl. Though their music is incomparably dark, the future is quite bright for PIG DESTROYER.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":276,\"height\":183},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":276,\"height\":183},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":276,\"height\":183},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":276,\"height\":183},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-og.jpg\",\"width\":276,\"height\":183},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":276,\"height\":183},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":276,\"height\":183},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":276,\"height\":183},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/63/73-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":276,\"height\":183}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://pigdestroyer.bandcamp.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://myspace.com/therealpigdestroyer\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/TheRealPigDestroyer\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/PigDestroyerVA\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"PigDestroyerVA\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1666683,\"name\":\"Deceased\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Trends have come and gone, but DECEASED's brand of true-to-the-roots heavy metal has done nothing but mature, distancing them from the throng of half-hearted pretenders, bandwagon jumping retro-metallers, and pseudo-metal shams. Having championed the cause of true metal for fifteen (!) years, Arlington, Virginia's DECEASED are universally recognized as not only pioneers of the true spirit of death metal, but as keepers of the flame of heavy metal's past, present and future. DECEASED arose in 1985, drawing inspiration from BLACK SABBATH, VENOM, RAVEN, MERCIFUL FATE, SLAYER and SODOM. During the period of 1985-1989, DECEASED recorded and circulated three demos (The Evil Side Of Religion, Birth By Radiation and Nuclear Exorcist ) that galvanized their reputation as trailblazers of original, technical American death metal. The 1988 hit and run death of bassist Rob Sterzel brought Les Snyder into the fold, completing the quintessential DECEASED line-up (rounded out by King Fowley on drums/vocals, Mark Adams and Mike Smith on guitars). Extensive self-promotion and frequent gigging up and down the east coast brought the band to the attention of a brand new label- Relapse Records - to which DECEASED were the first band to sign.\\n\\nIn May of 1991, Relapse issued the Gutwrench 7\\\" EP, which built up frenetic underground anticipation for their full-length debut, entitled Luck Of The Corpse. Released in February, 1992, Luck Of The Corpse sold an amazing 15,000 copies without the benefit of a tour to support it. Little more than a year later, DECEASED released a five song follow-up titled The Thirteen Frightened Souls (which included a rousing version of VOIVOD's Voivod).\\n\\nTwo years passed as the band crafted new songs and continued to gig frequently, opening for renowned death metal acts like MORBID ANGEL and NAPALM DEATH before entering Inner Ear Studios (FUGAZI, NIRVANA) to record their sophomore effort The Blueprints For Madness in 1995. Despite incredibly raw production, the massive strength of the songs themselves garnered extreme enthusiasm from both fans and critics alike. The remainder of 1995 saw more regional and local gigging, honing the band's skills even further. 1995 also saw Last World Records (a small Maryland label) issue all of the now-classic early demos (along with some raw live sets) under the moniker Death Metal From The Grave.\\n\\n1997 brought Fearless Undead Machines, a perfect union of the power and ferocity of true death metal with the song-writing finesse and grace of its classic metal forerunners, Fearless Undead Machines firmly placed DECEASED a step ahead of retro-metal purveyors who had only then (ten years later) begun to catch up with them. Fearless Undead Machines was an immediate classic in the history of metaldom. An eleven piece concept album inspired by George A. Romero's Night Of The Living Dead / Dawn Of The Dead / Day Of The Dead trilogy, Fearless Undead Machines was given the midas touch from producer Jim Barnes (MORGION, MINDROT), allowing the band's music to be expressed and comprehended as never before. No matter the intention, Fearless....exhibited with a majesty that underground metal hadn't witnessed for years. The brilliant lead guitar work and interplay (see The SIlent Creature and the title track) that Mike and Mark layed down harkened back to the glory days of IRON MAIDEN and JUDAS PRIEST without sacrificing any of the bite for which extreme metal become known. DECEASED received unrelenting support from both die-hard fans and press as fans of metal collectively raised their fists and banged their heads in unison to Fearless Undead Machine's unwavering dedication to true, underground riffage and straightforward metallic themes.\\n\\nThe band gigged up and down the east coast, topping it all off with a triumphant set at the first annual March Metal Meltdown (1999) in Asbury Park, NJ. While DECEASED continued to play the off-weekend sets at thrash-friendly venues, they were consumed with writing and preparing for their next full-length release. A classic performance at the 1999 November To Dismember gave fans glimpse of what they could expect from the forthcoming album. Fight for metal!! With Supernatural Addiction, DECEASED have again reached through the mirror of time, grabbed the ghost of heavy metal's past by the throat and resuscitated its odorous corpse.\\n\\nThe first band ever to sign with Relapse, DECEASED commences the label's charge into to new millennium with the unreal Supernatural Addiction. Amongst tales of terror, cold shivers and frozen screams, dynamic guitar interplay and unforgettable harmony lines form a thick metal exoskeleton around which King places his gruff, ghastly vocal lashings and thunderous percussive poundings. Paralyzing time with an obsessive devotion to 80's metal stylings, DECEASED champion head-banging thrash riffage, leaving far behind the ever-growing pack of retro-metallers who are only now beginning to catch up. Colossal production from renowned producer Simon Efemey (AMORPHIS, PARADISE LOST) advances the haunting, majestic ferocity of these underground stalwarts. Drawing macabre lyrical inspiration from classic horror-media including The Twilight Zone, Trilogy Of Terror and the original Tales From The Crypt motion picture, Supernatural Addiction conjures fearsome apparitions of thought-provoking classic heavy metal mysticism. This is original, technical American death metal...this is DECEASED! Poseurs beware!! \\n\\nThe masters of sick thrash follow up their now-legendary Supernatural Addiction album with the haunting Behind The Mourner's Veil. This gut-wrenching EP contains the unhuman new DECEASED tracks It's Alive!, The Mausoleum and Victims Of The Masterplan paired with blistering covers of band favorites and metal classics Zombie Attack (TANKARD), The New Age of Total Warfare (WARFARE), Reaganomics (DRI) and Deathrider (ANTHRAX). Pray for your fading survival as DECEASED deliver death metal like no other band can. A video for Supernatural Addiction's Elly's Dementia also appears as a special CD-ROM treat for long time fans!
