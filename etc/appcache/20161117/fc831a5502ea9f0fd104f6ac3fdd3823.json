In January, they released their second single \\\"Bitch\\\" to radio and have begun touring in preparation for the Spring 2015 launch of their first full length eponymous album BRIDGE TO GRACE.\\n\\nLoaded with powerful songs that range from hard-hitting rockers to emotionally driven ballads, David Garcia (vocals), Alex Cabrera (guitar, vocals, piano), Christian Lowenstein (bass) and Justin Little (drum, vocals) have a musical chemistry like no other. Their unique and compelling sounds leave fans wanting more and their motto of \\\"write a song a day\\\" shows just how determined and dedicated they are to 'making it.' Not to mention Cabrera and Lowenstein are a mere nineteen years old.\\n\\nHailing from Atlanta, Georgia, Bridge To Grace was formed by Cabrera in 2010 when he recruited Lowenstein, whom he met while attending Atlanta's Music Matters. Two years later, Little joined and finally Garcia, thanks to producer Rick Beato's suggestion that vocal tracks of Garcia be sent to Cabrera. After one listen, Cabrera knew he was the voice for Bridge To Grace and the band was born!\\n\\nIn late 2013, Bridge To Grace released their first EP \\\"Staring in the Dark,\\\" produced by Beato (Shinedown, Need to Breathe) for indie label Long Run Records. Their first single \\\"The Fold\\\" was released to radio in January 2014 and landed in the Top 50 on the active rock charts. That same year, the guys completed their first nationwide tour sharing the stage with bands such as Theory of a Deadman, Pop Evil, Fuel, Puddle of Mudd, Smile Empty Soul, Tantric, and Drowning Pool. Additionally, Bridge To Grace has performed at The Taste of Madison, Dirt Fest, The Dane County Fair and Texas Showdown in addition to doing several radio and television appearances to promote their music and tour.\\n\\nThe eponymous album BRIDGE TO GRACE will be released in Spring 2015 and available on iTunes, Amazon, and bridgetogracemusic.com.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bridgetogracemusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/BridgeToGrace/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bridge2grace\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bridge2grace\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1277163,\"name\":\"Artifas\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Artifas is a modern rock band from Memphis, TN. It is comprised of Scottie Somerville, Cody Criswell, Mikey Miller, Anthony Mattox and Jared Wainscott.\\n\\nArtifas is about the music. The members of this band came from numerous backgrounds from metal to classic rock. They used these influences to create their own sound to make their mark in the industry.\\n\\nThey began recording demos in their own studio, based in their hometown of Martin, TN in the early months of 2011. After months of bouncing around from city to city and making attempts at recording with once famous artists, the band finally decided on Blake Allison of Egypt Central to produce their debut release.\\n\\nThe debut record focuses on the concept of duality, and the balance of good and evil that resides within every person. The selection of songs set for the record vary from easy listening, melodic tunes, to more high energy, heavier songs, a stylistic array that the band is known for.\\n\\nWith an exciting, energetic stage show and powerful music, Artifas plans to reach out to music lovers around the world.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.signalrising.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/signalrising/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1367753?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
