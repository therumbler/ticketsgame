Eddie\u2019s Father had introduced them to the RAMONES and THE DICKIES when they started listening to music. They had started going to punk shows in Chicago by 1998. In just a few years they had seen almost every band that had influenced them. After 10 years of experimenting with other genres of music (metal/surf) they decided to regroup and form KOBANES due to their disappointment with the return of the dead genre. The KOBANES formed in April of 2008. The original line up was Marky, Eddie, and Dominick. The band was busy with other more serious bands and decided to try and release a 7 inch and call it quits. But, after being offered a record deal with two Japanese labels they quickly made KOBANES their main focus. FIXING A HOLE AND DUMB! Records planned to release \u201cPUBLIC AFFECTION,\u201d the KOBANES 1st album. Half way through recording the album they recruited Eric on 2nd guitar. The KOBANES were now a 4 piece. After a year of playing local Chicago shows they started to write their 2nd album, \u201cJAPAN INVASION.\u201d Once the album was finished a Japan tour was in the works. Unfortunately, work got in the way of Dominick\u2019s performance and was forced to quit the band. The band was devastated due to Dom\u2019s extreme size and personality, for he was the one who originally came up with the name KOBANES. (The band was originally going to be called the Winslows, but their childhood love for Nirvana won the contest) The band had then added Johnny on Bass. Johnny was quickly replaced after slapping Marky\u2019s girlfriend in face, which ended in street fight. Next on bass was Jason. He was a local they often ran into at the grocery store and at shows downtown. The KOBANES completed \u201cJAPAN INVASION,\u201d and toured Japan by September of 2009. It was a dream come true for the band. Selling thousands of copies and playing packed venues in Japan for 2 weeks. But, after the tour another bass player change was in need. Jason had quit before he could be kicked out due to personal differences in the band. According to KOBANES, Jason just didn\u2019t have the attitude they were shooting for. After trying out all the bass players they could find, it was easier just to become a 3 piece, so Eric hopped on bass. After only being a band for nearly 2 years the KOBANES had opened for most of their favorite bands such as : SLOPPY SECONDS, TEEN IDOLS, BEATNIK TERMITES, TEENAGE BOTTLE ROCKET, THE HUNTINGTONS, AND CJ RAMONE (just to name a few). During the next year they hit the studio and recorded 4 songs that would then end up on \u201cFALSE ACCUASTION.\u201d Everything was going great for the KOBANES, until they got kicked off The INSUBORDIANATION FEST. Who would have thought Marky\u2019s dark black metal past would have come back to haunt him? His old band had anti-sematic imagery that would label the band as racists. This was devastating to the band. The KOBANES became a joke on message boards and were constantly being bashed. The KOBANES have no racist lyrics or imagery, and all date outside of their nationalities. The only thing they could do was hope the hype would die down. But, then the next photo shoot became a mockery as well. KOBANES letterman jackets as a 3 piece read KKK! Eric couldn\u2019t take it, so he decided to quit. That same day a longtime fan had texted Marky saying \u201cI want to be a KOBANE.\u201d The KOBANES prayers were answered. John a.k.a. FUZZ was the new bass player. He was perfect; he had QUEERS and SCREECHING WEASEL tattoos, and even an anti-swastika tattoo as well. The KOBANES quickly moved forward, and toured the East coast. The tour was a success and they met a lot of great bands like: THE SHECKIES, JOHNIE 3, HOLLYWOOD BLONDES, and DEE CRACKS. During this tour in Pittsburgh was when they all got their famous cheese burger logo tattoos. While in New York, they even got to see inside Arturo Vega\u2019s apartment. This was an experience that made Marky and Eddie realize all their hard work had paid off and to keep the band going no matter what. After returning from tour Eddie had met Dave at a bar. Eddie had started talking to him because of his WALLY\u2019S t-shirt. Dave watched the band practice and soon joined to make the Kobanes a 4 piece again. Marky was happy, all KOBANES armed with black and white Mosrites, and the jackets would then read KKKK! A West coast tour and recording was in the works. After recording 6 songs and few shows Dave had quit. He was familiar with the bands past when he joined, but quit for the same reason as Eric? He also had a drinking problem and spent hours a day online. He also suffered from depression from a recent divorce. Dave had started to talk Fuzz into thinking negatively too. With a tour and a new album in the works Marky and Eddie couldn\u2019t take the chance, so they decided to kick Fuzz out and replace him as soon as possible. This was yet another devastation for the band, but a turn for the better. They had then recruited Aaron. Marky had met him in college. Marky started talking to him about his TEENAGE BOTTLE ROCKET t-shirt. He was a candidate for the band since the beginning but was too young. Now that he had finally turned 21 he was in! They quickly whipped him into shape and finished recording \u201cFALSE ACCUSATION,\u201d in May 2011. The West Coast tour was a go! They were armed with a solid line up, and in their opinion their best album! The tour went even better than the last almost selling out of merchandise! The KOBANES have been through a lot, but think they finally have the lineup they have been waiting for. KOBANES plan to release an album and tour every year until death do they party!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":958},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":299},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":958},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":499},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":649},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/76/25/51-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/KOBANES\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.brauerhouse.com/event/1367483?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
