Witt\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Alicia Witt has a passion for connecting with her fans. \u201cThe thing I love the most is when people come up to me after a show and they tell me that a song perfectly describes a situation they\u2019re going through,\u201d says the singer, songwriter, pianist and acclaimed actor, whose first full-length studio LP, Revisionary History, comes out May 5, 2015.\\r\\nWitt\u2019s new album is full of songs like that: nine of them, to be exact, that deal in themes of heartbreak, loyalty and the amazing power that comes with finding your own voice \u2014and using it. \u201cThis record is probably the most personal thing that I\u2019ve put out,\u201d says Witt, who released a self-titled EP in 2009 and the full-length Live at Rockwood in 2012, in between parts in films and on TV in an acting career that began with her debut in the David Lynch sci-fi classic Dune in 1984, when she was 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all the autobiographical touches on Revisionary History, it\u2019s also a collection of deeply relatable songs. The reflective piano ballad \u201cFriend\u201d opens the album with Witt sifting through feelings of attraction for someone she knows should be just a pal and not a lover, while the aching vocal showcase \u201cConsolation Prize\u201d pairs torchy piano with taut electric guitar accents as Witt muses over the ways in which we edit our pasts to fit the present. Revisionary history, indeed \u2014 the album title comes from a lyric in that song.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe can constantly be revising how we remember things, and maybe that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d says Witt, whose TV credits include The Sopranos, Friday Night Lights and Law & Order: Criminal Intent. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s how we move on.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Ben Folds, Revisionary History was years in the making. Some of the songs date back to the mid-\u201900s, which gave her plenty of time to hone them in concert before heading to Folds\u2019 studio in Nashville, where she recorded the album in two week-long chunks in the spring and late fall of 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cHe\u2019s got such a unique and specific vision for how those songs should best be presented,\u201d Witt says of Folds. \u201cI had no doubt that he was going to bring to it his own vision for the sound of each song, but he also wanted it to be a truthful reflection of what I do. The record sounds very much like me.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWitt credits Folds for digging into the essence of each song for musical arrangements that sometimes brought out their hidden sides: the folky stomp on \u201cBlind,\u201d for example, highlighted the rootsy touches in a song Witt had been performing for years, while the mournful trumpet and marching drumbeat perfectly captured the mood on \u201cDown,\u201d a tune inspired by the smart but troubled character Witt played on Season Five of the Emmy-nominated FX series Justified, and featuring the Emmy-nominated New York rapper and actor T.O.N.E-z\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhen I heard it all put together, it made me cry,\u201d Witt says. \u201cAt the end, when the trumpet comes in, it sounds like a soul making its way up.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there\u2019s the girl-power anthem \u201cAbout Me,\u201d which shows the influence of Folds and Billy Joel in the robust piano and Witt\u2019s defiant, determined vocals; or the lush, sultry \u201960s-style pop tune \u201cTheme From Pasadena,\u201d which Witt wrote with Folds for the movie Cold Turkey (Witt starred opposite Peter Bogdanovich and Cheryl Hines in the indie drama, which was originally to be called Pasadena). In fact, Revisionary History boasts such an array of sounds and styles that there\u2019s no pigeonholing Witt as a musician.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI love all different types of music, so the songs that I come up with and am drawn to when I\u2019m writing are naturally all over the place,\u201d says Witt, whose movie credits include 88 Minutes with Al Pacino and Two Weeks Notice with Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.\\r\\n\\r\\nWitt has been a music lover since she was a little girl growing up in Worcester, Mass. She began playing piano when she was 7, competing in international piano competitions into her teen years. After she moved to Los Angeles at 14, she supported herself by playing in the lobby lounge of the Beverly Wilshire hotel until she landed her first regular acting job on the CBS show Cybil when she was 16. It took a few more years before she began consistently writing her own songs, and it wasn\u2019t until 2008 that she started performing them. Her first gig was opening for Jimmy Webb at a benefit in New York. Moving from standards and show tunes to original songs was a big leap for Witt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThere was a considerable fear factor,\u201d she says. \u201cAs an actor doing theater and doing live television, it wasn\u2019t about performing for people. It was about performing my own music. That\u2019s incredibly vulnerable.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWitt\u2019s fears that audiences wouldn\u2019t respond proved very much unfounded, and the vulnerability of opening up to strangers helped her make the all-important connection that turned them into fans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe most that I can hope for as a singer-songwriter is telling these stories that are incredibly personal, but saying them in a way that somebody else can relate to their own experiences,\u201d Witt says.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-og.jpg\",\"width\":1500,\"height\":1000},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/59/27/97-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://aliciawittmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/aliciawittmusic\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/officialaliciawitt?_rdr\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/aliciawitty\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"aliciawitty\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1359987?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
