Adding more history to those frequent flier miles, the versatile saxophonist toured the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia. Now, a few years after soulfully chronicling life on the road (on his groundbreaking 2011 album Traveler), Snitzer explores and celebrates intimate places closer to heart and home, with American Beauty.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe lush and melodic, sonically adventurous set artfully blends retro touches in groove and instrumentation with electronic-driven soundscapes and pattern-based motions. While keeping the rich, emotional thrust of his horn front and center, the creatively restless composer and artist continues to expand the textural palette he inaugurated on Traveler (and continued exploring on 2013\u2019s The Rhythm).   And after some years away from playing his alto sax, Snitzer happily rediscovers its impactful voice on five tracks of American Beauty \u2013 \u201cOn and On \u201cShe Loves Me,\u201d \u201cAmerican Beauty,\u201d \u201cWillow\u201d and \u201cMontreal.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nTo help him execute this exciting vision, Snitzer called on musical colleagues who have played key roles in his projects for years, including David Mann (additional production, keys/synths/MIDI, saxophones, flutes), pianist Alain Mallet, bassist Tim Lefebvre and drummer Karl Latham. He also works for the first time with drummers Clint de Ganon and Gary Novak, and the powerhouse horn section of Kent Smith (trumpet) and Michael Davis (trombone).   On the hypnotic, liquid soul ballad \u201cNext To You,\u201d Snitzer complements his cool tenor vibe with Carl Fischer\u2019s trumpet, flugelhorn, trombone and tenor sounds. American Beauty also features special guest performances by Fourplay guitarist Chuck Loeb, who rocks and jangles on the old school R&B jam \u201cMondays at Gert's\u201d; and Rick Braun, whose flugelhorn adds a dreamy sensuality to the playful and sensual easy thumping Barry White/Earth, Wind & Fire influenced soul-jazz tune \u201cShe Loves Me.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nCollectively, the songs on the provocatively titled American Beauty create a thoughtful ideological response to Traveler.  Snitzer celebrates wonderful memories of the past while sharing the joy of his life \u201chere in the moment.\u201d  American Beauty is simultaneously an ode to a nascent American musical life, full of hope and dreams, and to that same life after three decades of work, travel, reflection, and return to home.\\r\\n \\r\\n \u201cOn Traveler,\u201d Snitzer says, \u201cI wrote many of the songs in cities across the globe, responding to inspiration from some beautiful, exotic, foreign place; but a place that I was not from. American Beauty is a response to that process, a reflection on my home, and my life at home, experiences, people and places, during formative years in the late 70s and early 80s, but also on life as it is now.\\\"\\r\\n\\\"On Traveler I learned that my best work happens when I start from a position, a thesis, an overall idea in mind.\u201d Tapping into some senior year high school memories on \u2018September \u201879\u2019, summers home from college on \u2018Mondays at Gert\u2019s,\u2019 (that long defunct Philly organ bar where Snitzer used to sat-in at the Monday night open jam).  \u2018Daddy-O\u2019 is a brassy, blues-funk tribute to a cool hotel bar scene on the NJ shoreline.  All of these are positive reflections on past, joyful times, before all this traveling, back the Philly metro area was my whole world.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nWhile perhaps best known in the pop/rock worlds for his multiple tours with Paul Simon and his travels with The Rolling Stones on their Voodoo Lounge and Bridges to Babylon tours, Snitzer has amassed a dynamic solo discography driven by his evolving lead voice on the horn and his interest in ambiences and rhythms. Back in 1999, years before chill became a vast and influential subgenre of contemporary jazz, the saxophonist felt inspired one day and sat down at the piano at his parents\u2019 house. Retreating to Some Quiet Place in his creative mind, he began writing that album, a follow up to Ties That Bind (1994) and In The Eye Of The Storm (1996), the two Warner Bros. albums that put Snitzer on the map. His recent discography includes the influential Traveler (2011), and The Rhythm (2013.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn addition to being a road warrior and one of contemporary jazz\u2019s most acclaimed solo performers, composers and producers, Snitzer has kept some inspiring company as a first call NY sideman. His rise through the ranks of today\u2019s saxophonists includes dates with superstars of every genre: Eric Clapton, Aretha Franklin, Beck, Jay-Z, Panic at the Disco, and Christina Aguilera, among literally hundreds of others. In 2012, the saxophonist contributed horn arrangements and baritone and tenor parts to The World From The Side of the Moon, the debut album from American Idol Phillip Phillips. Snitzer also appears on Paul Simon Live in New York City, recorded during the legendary singer/songwriter\u2019s 2011 tour. As he was releasing Traveler, Snitzer also appeared on Simon\u2019s So Beautiful Or So What, Tony Bennett\u2019s Duets II and Nicole Henry\u2019s Embraceable.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cMy career has been a fascinating journey in so many ways,\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s been a privilege working with and learning from some of the world\u2019s most legendary artists and innovators.  I can't overestimate the benefit of being able to watch Paul Simon work, up close.  It took a while, but on my recent releases I'm finally operating at a level that reflects everything I've been able to learn from masters like Paul.\\r\\nBeing a new father, being off the road, at home, in this beautiful place, considering my life and all the people that have made it so rich.   American Beauty is the creative result of these thoughts and inspirations.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atjmbo.jpeg\",\"width\":275,\"height\":183},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atjmbo1.jpeg\",\"width\":275,\"height\":183},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atlg.jpeg\",\"width\":275,\"height\":183},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atlg1.jpeg\",\"width\":275,\"height\":183},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atmd.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atmd1.jpeg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-og.jpeg\",\"width\":275,\"height\":183},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atsm.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atsm1.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-sq.jpeg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-sqsm.jpeg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atxl.jpeg\",\"width\":275,\"height\":183},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":275,\"height\":183},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atxxl.jpeg\",\"width\":275,\"height\":183},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/30/61-atxxl1.jpeg\",\"width\":275,\"height\":183}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"L5FI2Bwg5TQ\",\"title\":\"Andy Snitzer \\\"Candy\\\"\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L5FI2Bwg5TQ\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L5FI2Bwg5TQ\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.andysnitzer.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/andysnitzer.fan/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/andysnitzer\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"andysnitzer\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1403675,\"name\":\"Gerald Veasley\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Gerald Veasley\u2019s musical odyssey has taken him to the top of the contemporary music world as a bassist, bandleader, composer, producer and educator.
