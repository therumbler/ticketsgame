Ever since the motley quartet of Seattle music-scene lifers came together in 2014, Gazebos has been a shining beacon of the city's live-music landscape, their performances raucous and cathartic and hilarious, uniting the tribes under a banner of unabashed and unabridged fun. Now\u2014finally!\u2014Gazebos have an album out, their debut for Hardly Art Records, and nobody will be surprised that Die Alone is not the existential bummer the title suggests. Gazebos rages against the forces of post-millennial, pre-midlife anxiety and Die Alone is the soundtrack.\\n\\nWhich isn't to say it's a church picnic: Die Alone is more complex than simple genre tags or clich\u00e9d descriptors allow. The band coined the phrase \\\"whoa-pop\\\" to describe their music and they say they're not mad at the term \\\"prog-punk.\\\" Also consider that the album includes a cover from the Grease soundtrack that'll thrill the indie-rock theater-nerd contingent, such as it is. Chalk up the sonic free-for-all to each member's long and eclectic legacy of creative endeavors. None of these people has ever sat still very long.\\n\\nSinger Shannon Perry has been in bands all her life (including Butts and Katherine Hepburn's Voice), and is one of the Northwest's most sought-after tattoo artists. Guitarist TV Coahran runs the weirdest karaoke night in Seattle, named after his record label GGNZLA, and for the past few years has toured, performed, and collaborated with lo-fi legend R. Stevie Moore. Shane Herrell played guitar with critical darlings the First Times, then switched to bass for Gazebos and Bread & Butter, his good-times choogle-rock band. Drummer Jordan T. Adams, typically shirtless by song two at Gazebos shows, comes from cult-fave bands Spurm and Monarchies. They're all well-seasoned performers, they've all orbited each other's bands in and out of Seattle for close to 20 years, and they're all Cancers (except Shane: Capricorn).\\n\\nGiven the band's collision of interests, Die Alone's manic diversity makes perfect sense. These songs are patchworks of parts conceived individually as demos and woven together collectively during sessions in Coahran's basement\u2014which is also where the album was recorded on 8-track with Seattle garage-rock guru Kurt Bloch as engineer. No song sounds like another and yet the album sustains a dizzying, alluring vibe.\\n\\nIt hits you right from the start: Is that Perry singing backwards on opener \\\"Just Get High\\\"? Her vocal delivery is bewitchingly unpredictable, the band stretching the song around her like bubblegum. \\\"I Don't Wanna Be Here\\\" is the album's punchiest track, clocking in at two minutes thirty seconds, Perry venting some serious girl-power angst; dig the woozy flange on Coahran's guitar throughout. Perry further philosophizes on \\\"Sauna\\\" and \\\"Blend,\\\" swerving between her brassy mezzo-soprano and an intense speak-sing mode. \\\"Ere Specka\\\" is a nonsense phrase of Perry's own devising but, with her vocals buoyed by Coahran's, the hiccupy chorus makes its meaning clear. In Grease, Rizzo the proto-feminist Pink Lady sang \\\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\\\" with an empowered elegance that presaged Gazebos' smoldering update (and yes, that's a Rizzo tat on Perry's neck).\\n\\nIf Gazebos has a mission statement, it comes in album closer \\\"Boys I Like.\\\" On the surface it's a song of unrequited romance, but deeper down it's about living and loving every moment to the fullest. Perry sings, \\\"I'm dying right now/you're dying right now/every single one of us is dying/together alone right now.\\\" Yeah, we're all gonna die\u2014it's the one fate nobody escapes. We're all gonna Die Alone, and like Perry sings, that's fine. Somehow, coming from Gazebos, that news doesn't sound so bad.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/gazebos-1\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/gazebosband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ggazebos\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ggazebos\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1767357,\"name\":\"Summer Cannibals\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Summer Cannibals aren't wasting any time. The punk-flecked four-piece from Portland hit the ground at full speed, their 2013 debut album No Makeup catching people completely off-guard in their hometown and beyond. In just a few short months, Summer Cannibals earned deserved props from some of their heroes\u2014including a ringing endorsement from the Thermals\u2014opened for international touring bands like Chvrches, and found themselves at #2 on the coveted \\\"Best New Band\\\" list in Willamette Week. Now they're back with their second full-length, the raw, to-the-point Show Us Your Mind. As before, Summer Cannibals come armed only with the things they need: fuzz pedals, razor-sharp riffs, and songs that get stuck in your head the first time you hear 'em.\\n\\nThe group formed around guitarist/vocalist Jessica Boudreaux and guitarist Marc Swart in 2012, their sound fueled by Boudreaux's songwriting chops and the band's full-volume fervor, which flows most fluidly during Summer Cannibals' head-turning live shows. To capture that live spark, the band recorded Show Us Your Mind at Portland's hallowed Jackpot Studios with Larry Crane (Sleater-Kinney, Elliott Smith, Tape Op) behind the board. The group recorded and mixed to tape, working quickly to capture the momentum, and Show Us Your Mind is both a continuation of the straightforward statement-of-purpose on No Makeup, as well as an effective introduction to the band's ultimately catchy clang. These are pop songs played at air-raid volume, serving as a simple tonic for day-to-day frustrations.\\n\\n\\\"It's music that has been made for a long time. It's not like we've discovered some brand new thing,\\\" Boudreaux says. \\\"But life is short. Why not play music that makes you feel free, and crazy, and like you can do whatever you want?\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://summercannibals.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/SummerCannibals\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/SCannibalsBand\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"SCannibalsBand\"},{\"id\":1705289,\"name\":\"Boyfriends\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Boyfriends are a Seattle band who worship Freddie Mercury and host frequent nail painting parties.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":600},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":360},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":240},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-og.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":600},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":120},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":600},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":600},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/93/19-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://boyfriendsaretaken.bandcamp.com/releases\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Boyfriendsaretaken/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1379349?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
