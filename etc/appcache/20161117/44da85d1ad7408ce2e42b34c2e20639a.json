Call them Vocal Majority, then be prepared for an extraordinary musical experience that has touched tens of thousands of listeners around the world. Our tagline says it best: we're \\\"pure harmony.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years, Vocal Majority has released more than two-dozen recordings that feature their diverse musical repertoire that spans from sacred and inspirational, patriotic, time-honored barbershop, jazz, Broadway, pops, and Christmas.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOfficially known as the Dallas Metropolitan Chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society, Vocal Majority was formed by 12 men who gathered on December 2, 1971. Their vision was to create a chapter that would become the finest singing group in the world. So, under the guidance of founder, first president and marketing director Bob Arnold, the Chorus was born and Ray Anthony became the first director in April of 1972. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the burning desire to compete, Vocal Majority won its first Southwestern District Chorus Championship in the fall of 1973. During the summer of 1974, VM entered its first international competition with seventy-three men who brought home a third place finish. Director Ray Anthony persuaded VM member Jim Clancy to take over the role of director in August of 1974. In 1975, when Vocal Majority returned to international competition in Indianapolis, they brought home their first gold medal. Regrettably, the chorus was financially unable to attend the 1976 international swan song performance. In 1977 during the Houston Southwestern District Chorus competition, VM was awarded their third championship. In their quest to win in Cincinnati in the summer of 1978, the chorus endured a heart-breaking 10 point loss to the Louisville Thoroughbreds. As Clancy recalls...\u201dThat one loss was the best thing that ever happened to us, because learning to overcome that loss helped us develop heart and character. It (the loss) is when the real heart and soul of the Vocal Majority began.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nVocal Majority has medaled in every international competition in which it has competed. The medal count includes twelve gold medals, three silver medals and one bronze medal. The men of the VM are honored to have earned an unprecedented ten gold medals in a row from 1979 to 2006, with our most recent Gold Medal won in 2014. Society rules only allow choruses to win gold once every three years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its 40-year history, the VM has been known for its a cappella music, but the chorus has also enthralled new audiences by singing with many symphony orchestras including the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, Texas Wind Symphony, Las Colinas Symphony, Mid-Cities Orchestra, Richardson Symphony, Irving Symphony, San Angelo Symphony, Utah State Symphony and the Constitution Symphony Orchestra. The Chorus was also featured on national television along with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in a 1986 broadcast for the CBS Masterworks project titled Voices In Harmony. However, it is the 1998 performance with The Atlanta Symphony in Olympic Centennial Park that stands out as the Vocal Majority\u2019s largest audience with over 135,000 people in attendance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chorus has also performed at home in many of our United States, as well as abroad in England, Scotland, Wales, and Canada. In addition, the VM has sung in front of U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush and have been privileged to share the stage with The Four Freshmen, The Lettermen, The Oak Ridge Boys, The Suntones, the Texas Boys Choir, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Glen Campbell, Jimmy Dean, Bob Flanagan, John Gary, Lee Greenwood, Jack Jones and Johnny Mann. \\r\\n\\r\\nVocal Majority is proud to present their extensive discography which extends from the nostalgic yesteryears of 1975 running through today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men of Vocal Majority wish to thank you for your continued support and for being such an integral part of the VM\u2019s history \u201cin the making.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":619,\"height\":558},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":270},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":180},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-og.jpg\",\"width\":619,\"height\":558},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":90},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":451},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":619,\"height\":558},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/99/57-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1353683?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
