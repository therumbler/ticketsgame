McClinton\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"There are two kinds of people in the world: those who love Delbert McClinton and those who haven\u2019t heard him yet. Delbert is always working on that second group.\\r\\n\\r\\nLyle Lovett has said, \u201cIf we could all sing like we wanted to, we\u2019d all sing like Delbert.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe multi-Grammy Award winning artist is at the top of his game with his 19th studio album, Prick Of The Litter (Hot Shot Records/Thirty Tigers). The new offering captures the balance of soulful energy and restraint that the legendary performer has been delivering in his live performances for decades all over the world. On Prick of the Litter, Delbert incorporates a variety of styles, and as always, just enough to keep him comfortably outside the traditional marketing categories.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrick Of The Litter blends Delbert\u2019s signature rhythm and blues sound with a newer jazz-influence inspired by Johnny Mercer, Nat King Cole and other legendary crooners. He includes some upbeat traditional blues (\u201cDon\u2019t Do It\u201d) with a romantic take on Tony Bennett\u2019s San Francisco (\u201cSan Miguel\u201d) while \u201cSkip Chaser\u201d paints a vivid picture of the perils of the profession. A highlight is the album\u2019s closer, the gentle and hopeful \u201cRosy.\u201d McClinton\u2019s road band, Self-Made Men provide a hard-driving rhythm section, powerful guitars and innovative piano, accented by punched-up horns. Delbert\u2019s definitive vocals and distinct harmonica licks bring it all together.\\r\\n\\r\\nDelbert McClinton has been a leading Americana artist since before the genre was established. He has won two Grammy awards in the blues category for Best Contemporary Blues Album; and one in the rock category (Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group), with Bonnie Raitt for \u201cGood Man, Good Woman\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nDelbert\u2019s unique musical style grew from his Texas music beginnings. Influenced at a young age by Tejano, Western Swing, Rhythm and Blues and War songs, he developed a signature sound that served him well.\\r\\n\\r\\nDelbert grew up around Lubbock and Fort Worth, and spent his early career in the desegregating roadhouses of Fort Worth\u2019s Jacksboro Highway, leading the house bands for Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, and others, while making a local name for himself. Later, Delbert traveled to England where he headlined shows with Bruce Channel (\u201cHey Baby\u201d) with a little-known Liverpool band [The Beatles] as the opening act. He then rolled into Los Angeles as songwriters began to take top billing, and headed back to Texas for the progressive movement and blues renaissance that helped kick off Austin\u2019s role in American musical history.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\u2019ve seen a live Delbert McClinton show, you will recognize the synchronized energy on Prick Of The Litter that comes from thousands of miles of playing together. Delbert feels that his current road band, Self-Made Men, is the best band he\u2019s ever had.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cJack Bruno [drums] is amazing. He played with Joe Cocker and with Tina Turner for years. I\u2019ve been harder on drummers than anybody in the world, but Jack is right there where I need him. Dana Robbins [saxophone] and Quentin \u2018Q\u2019 Ware [trumpet] punctuate the live performances in just the right places. James Pennebaker [guitar] is family. He\u2019s been playing with me off and on since he was nineteen. Mike Joyce [bass guitar], Kevin McKendree [piano], and Bob Britt [guitar] are among my best friends, in addition to being in the band. Mike and Kevin and I write together a lot. We wrote most of the songs on this album together.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDelbert, Kevin and Bob also co-produced Prick Of The Litter. \u201cGoing into the studio with a band that\u2019s like family creates real magic,\u201d says Delbert. \u201cYou have the energy of a live band. We feed off of each other. We are better together. And it always feels like they have my back.\u201d Jimmie Vaughan and Lou Ann Barton are an added bonus on the first track. Delbert adds \u201cI am such a fan of Lou Ann and of Jimmie. We needed a female to do a part on \u2018Don\u2019t Do It.\u2019 Bob suggested Lou Ann, and I knew she would be perfect. I have always loved Jimmie and Lou Ann. I had talked to Jimmie about doing something on my last album but it didn\u2019t work out. So this time, we went to Austin and they both came into the studio. We spent about two hours and had a lot of fun. They are both so talented.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDelbert wrote or co-wrote ten of the songs on the album. \u201cBy the time we wrote these songs, Mike, Bob and Kevin had been in my band for a long time,\u201d says Delbert. \u201cWe got together every Wednesday for several weeks, and then we went to Mexico and finished writing the rest of the album.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n2017 is a milestone year for Delbert. In addition to the release of Prick Of The Litter, a biography is slated for release in September. He has also been nominated for Texas State Musician, a highly acclaimed state appointment akin to poet laureate.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrick of the Litter is a signature project for Delbert McClinton, and he is proud of it. \u201cWe worked hard on this and we got exactly what we wanted,\u201d he says. \u201cThe songs, the band, the production. Everything came together. We didn\u2019t leave no chicken on the bone,\u201d he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI did what I came to do with this album. I guess I really am One of the Fortunate Few.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-og.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/73/04-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"mj3I0YKplnI\",\"title\":\"Delbert McClinton Sending Me Angels\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mj3I0YKplnI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mj3I0YKplnI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.delbert.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/delbertmcclinton\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1749449,\"name\":\"Etta Britt\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Etta Britt is a Nashville-based R&B singer and songwriter who performs across the country and around the world.  Her most recent CD, \\\"Etta Does Delbert,\\\" released spring 2014, is a collection of Etta\u2019s takes on a variety of Delbert McClinton songs. The disc also includes a duet with Delbert\\r\\nEtta\u2019s 2012 release, \u201cOut of The Shadows,\u201d which she calls a \\\"cool groove record,\u201d attracted critical acclaim picking up over 200 radio stations around the world. It earned her an appearance on \u201cThe Today Show,\u201d and drew opening slots for Delbert McClinton and Paul Thorn. With the new release,  Etta continues to stake her claim as one of the most versatile singers working today\\r\\nThe Early Years\\r\\nIt all started with a hairbrush.  As a youngster, Etta Britt (born Melissa Prewitt) would spend hours at her bedroom mirror, belting out Supremes songs into her Stanley hairbrush.  Today the seasoned veteran is forging a recording and performing career of her own after touring with and backing up some of the top names in the business.\\r\\nBorn in Lancaster, Kentucky, a town of 3,500 south of Lexington, Melissa first became Etta at age 11, thanks to her little sister.  \\\"She called me Etta and I called her Myrna. We don't know why.  It could've been a couple of old ladies in our hometown out in the country.\\\"\\r\\nNashville Calls\\r\\nIn 1978, Etta \u2013 still known as Melissa -- joined Dave Rowland and Sue Powell in the country-music trio Dave & Sugar.  She stayed with the trio from 1979 to 1985, during which time they received CMA Vocal Group of the Year nominations five years in a row. The group toured with Kenny Rogers, Dottie West and Conway Twitty, among many others. The experience led to TV appearances on shows from \u201cPop! Goes the Country\u201d and \u201cSolid Gold\u201d to the \u201cDinah Shore Show\u201d and \u201cDance Fever.\u201d\\r\\nAfter Dave & Sugar, she made the rounds in Nashville, playing clubs and singing on sessions with Marty Stuart,  Waylon Jennings and others. During a session at Leon Russell's house, Etta\u2019s husband, renowned guitarist Bob Britt, memorialized his wife\u2019s stage name when he scribbled the name \u201cEtta Britt\u201d on a track sheet after Melissa\u2019s sister called asking for Etta.  \\r\\nWith two small children and not much money. Etta made a decision to put her music career on the back burner and devote herself to her family,  taking jobs cleaning houses, waiting tables and selling real estate to help pay the bills.  For a while anyway. . .\\r\\nOut of the Shadows and Into the Limelight\\r\\nAlthough she never totally stopped singing or gave up her dream of one day performing for a living, Etta was resolved to the fact that her time for a full-blown solo career might have come and gone. That all changed in 2010 when she was invited to sign a record deal in her early 50s.\\r\\nThe product of that deal, \\\"Out of the Shadows\\\" generated a wide range of critical acclaim.   An article in the Huffington Post landed on the front page of AOL.com. That lead to Etta being featured on \\\"The Today Show.\u201d   She spent 2012 touring with Delbert McClinton and Paul Thorn as well as touring on her own and making television and radio appearances.\\r\\nHer 2014 record, \u201cEtta Does Delbert,\u201d builds on the very successful foundation laid by \u201cOut of the Shadows.\u201d   \u201cI\u2019m excited about the release of the new record and about the idea of getting out and playing this new material around the country.   I\u2019ve had a lot of requests to get out there, and I\u2019m working to make that happen \u2013 at festivals, clubs, and concert venues.\u201d\\r\\nShe is excited about her second record and what this phase of her life will bring.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":620,\"height\":421},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":620,\"height\":421},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":204},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":136},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-og.jpg\",\"width\":620,\"height\":421},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":68},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":340},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":620,\"height\":421},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/34/43/81-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":620,\"height\":421}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"XXznrmvTwU8\",\"title\":\"Etta Britt \\\"Leap Of Faith\\\"\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXznrmvTwU8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXznrmvTwU8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://ettabritt.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/ettabritt\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ettarocks\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ettarocks\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://variety-playhouse.com/event/1340719?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
