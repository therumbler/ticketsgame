Michaelson\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"To say Ingrid Michaelson is prolific is an understatement: In just a decade, she has released six albums (five of which have charted) and ten singles (eight charted). But to say she's an emotional multitasker? That's a relatively new accomplishment for her. The love's-labors-lost banger \\\"Hell No,\\\" is her first single in a year. It's also surprisingly playful. Because over the past two years, Michaelson has grappled with not only the personal and familial sickness chronicled in her previous album, 'Lights Out,' but also the death of her mother and demise of her marriage. For some, it can take a lifetime to navigate the stages of so much grief. But Michaelson did it in record time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer new album, the aptly named 'It Doesn't Have to Make Sense' (out August 26, Cabin 24/RED), is a powerfully honest time capsule of her undoings and rebirths. \\\"Allowing myself to not try to make everything make sense was freeing for me,\\\" she explains the New York-based singer. \\\"Life doesn't always make sense.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, her glass-half-full outlook served her richly. It started with beautiful, idiosyncratic creations such as \\\"The Way I Am\\\" (2007) and \\\"Maybe\\\" (2009), songs that have breathed life into everything from \\\"Grey's Anatomy\\\" to an Old Navy ad and made a mark on the singles charts. The momentum never waned. Her last two albums, 'Human Again' and the more contemplative 'Lights Out,' both hit No. 5 on the Billboard charts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough her last album teemed with melancholia, she introduced it with the uplifting hit \\\"Girls Chase Boys.\\\" (It ended up being her highest Billboard Hot 100 single since \\\"The Way I Am.\\\") Similarly, the joyful \\\"Hell No\\\" is a gateway to the all-parts-of-the-buffalo 'It Doesn't Have to Make Sense.' \\\"There are heart-wrenching songs on it, but some are just fun for fun's sake,\\\" she says. \\\"You can choose the path of darkness or you can choose the path of light. The record reflects a positive motion.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-written with Nashville songwriter Luke Laird -- who also contributed to the back-porch party \\\"Celebrate,\\\" her album's other contact high -- \\\"Hell No\\\" is essentially a country song gussied up as a pop song. \\\"It's about an angry woman who is going to leave this cheating man,\\\" she says. \\\"The lyrics are not about a specific relationship -- it's about 5 or 6 different ones, culled together.\\\" Lest you take her message too seriously, Michaelson is in rare form in the video: She can be found modeling all the face-morphing Lenses that Snapchat has to offer. (The vibrant spot also hints at her side projects: a TV pilot she's co-written and is shopping now and her upcoming feature film debut -- \\\"Humor Me,\\\" Sam Hoffman's directorial debut, also starring Elliott Gould, Jemaine Clement, Bebe Neuwirth, Erich Bergen and Annie Potts.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I think on 'Lights Out,' I was learning how to let people in,\\\" she says. \\\"This time around, I kind of knew what I was getting into. I was just going into songwriting in such a different way -- I was so unguarded.\\\" Which was a particularly gutsy leap of faith, since so much of 'It Doesn't Have to Make Sense,' being inspired by her mom, is so close to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Light Me Up\\\" is, hands down, the rawest wound on the album. Penned in late 2014, just a week after her mother's death, the fluttering song is a snapshot of her anguish, warts and all. \\\"These are fresh, in-the-middle-of-the nightmare vocals,\\\" she says. \\\"That song came from a place of wanting to see her again, not really understanding where she's gone.\\\" Rendering it live will be painful, \\\"But,\\\" clarifies Michaelson, \\\"I'll never write a song that I don't want to sing over and over again.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat she probably didn't anticipate was her grief sparking a surge in creativity. \\\"I have odder pieces of music that I put on the record,\\\" she says. \\\"It would be a lie to say that I didn't care. But I cared less about what people think.\\\" The cinematic \\\"Another Life,\\\" for instance, packs a lot into one song: string arrangements, tempo changes, nightingale vocals. \\\"That song came out of a little assignment where I wanted to write a song with as many bizarre chord changes as I could. I kind of just sat at the piano and made the melody fit over it,\\\" she says. It's about the romance of feeling connected to someone. \\\"It was a very simple sentiment wrapped up in a very intricate piece of music,\\\" she says. \\\"I was really just trying to make a symphony in three minutes.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of symphony is key. Much of 'It Doesn't Have to Make Sense' is Michaelson broadening her musicianship by endeavoring to communicate more through evocative sounds than her actual lyrics. While the album does not belabor any aural theme, it does make spectacular use of strings and harmony in its gut-wrenching laments. \\\"Drink You Gone,\\\" written with Busbee in just two hours, is a classic love song that relives the moment Michaelson was holding the hand of her mother, as she faded away in the hospital. Meanwhile, the heartbreakingly quiet \\\"The Old Days\\\" captures the feeling of \\\"moving forward, but never forgetting the love.\\\" If there is a thread to the randomness of 'It Doesn't Have to Make Sense,' it is that one can only purge emotions after nearly drowning in a rush of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This was me was finding my way out of the darkness. And asking, 'Where do I go from here?'\\\" she says. \\\"It's been a struggle to become fulfilled again. And I had to put that sorrow into something.\\\" In that sense, 'It Doesn't Have to Make Sense' is an epic break-up album, in which Michaelson finally bids farewell to demons.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/08/84/87-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/storyman/id730485236?uo=4&at=10ltdS\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.ingridmichaelson.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://myspace.com/ingridmichaelson\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://facebook.com/ingridmichaelson\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ingridmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ingridmusic\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1727441,\"name\":\"AJR\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"There is no band, no song, no video, no sound, that is more \\\"now\\\" than AJR.\\n\\nThe band \u2014 three brothers born and raised in New York City \u2014 has achieved a startling quick level of success with \\\"I'm Ready,\\\" a buoyant electro-pop single that's taking off.  The numbers: over 1 million YouTube views for \\\"I'm Ready,\\\" thousands of singles sold each week, features in Billboard and the New York Post, and heavy airplay on pop radio's coveted SiriusXM \\\"Hits 1.\\\"  And their tour dates last fall included shows with The Wanted, Demi Lovato, and Hoodie Allen.\\nMore amazing? They've done this all on their own. \\n\\nNo pop svengali overseeing their work. No studio musicians filling in the blanks. No Max Martin co-write. \\n\\nAJR may, in fact, be the first independent, DIY pop group from New York to make a splash. They're certainly the only group that's done it while writing, recording and producing all their own songs in their Chelsea living room. Their '6foot1' EP includes \\\"I'm Ready,\\\" along with quintessential NY songs  \\\"Woody Allen,\\\" \\\"Growing Old on Bleecker Street,\\\" and the anthemic \\\"After Hours.\\\" \\n\\nSo let's meet the intriguing Met brothers \u2014 Adam (bass/vocals), a 23-year old Columbia graduate. Ryan (guitar/piano/vocals), a bespectacled 19-year old Columbia student who serves as the band's main songwriter. And Jack (vocals/guitar), the 16-year old prodigy who splits time between lead vocals and attending the Professional Children's School on NYC's Upper West Side. \\n\\nEight years ago, the brothers got their musical start busking in Central Park and Washington Square, singing Jackson 5 covers, and, later, their own material.\\n\\nAdmittedly, the brothers were no strangers to the spotlight: All three were into theater from a young age, and two of them have TV and movie work in their background (Ryan had a small role on \\\"Chappelle's Show,\\\" while Jack was in \\\"The Pink Panther\\\"). \\n\\nBut music was their passion. \\\"We realized that the three of us could sing together and our voices worked really well harmonizing,\\\" Adam remembers.\\n\\nThey took those busking earnings to buy musical equipment, which they \u2014 thanks to some supportive parents \u2014 set up in their living room, now transformed into a recording studio. \\n\\n\\\"When we're playing, you can hear it in the entire hallway,\\\" says Jack. \\\"It's actually really amazing we haven't gotten complaints.\\\"\\n\\nAs they were practicing, some interesting sounds started to appear. \\\"We were combining older music, from the '50s and '60s, with more modern music,\\\" explains Ryan, who dubs their sound as both \\\"electric and folksy.\\\"\\n\\nTheir break came last year. Bored in a psychology class, Ryan tweeted out a link of an earlier version of their video for \\\"I'm Ready\\\" to dozens of celebrities. The song was something Ryan actually wrote while stuck in his Columbia dorm room during Hurricane Sandy. (\\\"I thought it was instantly a hit,\\\" his brother Jack would later admit.)\\n\\nApparently, some of those celebrity tweeters heard a hit as well, including popular singer-songwriter Sia, who tweeted back and, eventually, formed a bond with the brothers. \\n\\nFrom those first few mentions, \\\"I'm Ready\\\" took on a life of its' own. The \\\"Spongebob Squarepants\\\"-sampling pop track, which Billboard favorably compared to Beach Boys and Simon & Garfunkel (for the harmonies) and Fun and Imagine Dragons (for the electro-pop influences), started getting play on Sirius XM's \\\"20 On 20.\\\"\\n\\nThe amazing music video for \\\"I'm Ready\\\" soon followed and the views continue to jump at an incredible rate.  At heart, the video is performance based but mixed with a cornucopia of social media tropes and, concurrently, acting as a commentary on the band's own rise to fame (very meta for a pop band). It was, as one fan described, \\\"something that could only be made right now.\\\" \\n\\nWhat's next: The band was just named iHeartRadio's Artist of the Month for Top 40, and a Myspace \\\"One to Watch\\\" in February, which is when \\\"I'm Ready\\\" will officially impact pop radio.  And late this spring, AJR will release their debut album, all written, produced and mixed in their living room. As one article described the early results: \\\"Sticky-sweet pop melodies with vintage barber shop vocals [and] edgier electronic samples and 'spokestep' [aka dubstep breakdowns derived from vocals].\\\" \\n\\nAsk AJR about their rise to fame\u2014and their apparent lack of band turmoil\u2014 and the band points to the one thing that's always united them.\\n\\n\\\"The fact that we're brothers helps,\\\" says Ryan. \\\"Because we're so close to each other, it's not really an ego battle anymore. It's just, let's find the best possible answer and create the best possible music.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.ajrbrothers.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/AJRBrothers\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ajrbrothers\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ajrbrothers\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.thelincolndc.com/event/1190307?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
