But now the New Jersey group will explore a new frontier: Space. The band's new album, Comet, their ninth full-length studio release, showcases the fact that even after a quarter of a century the musicians can still find new artistic and musical ground. After a few late-night tour conversations about the 2012 end of the world prophecies, the band members penned a song called \\\"Comet,\\\" a track that grappled with the idea of living life to the fullest no matter when life might cease to continue. That track evolved into the disc's title and cover art.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That song is about the idea that a comet could hit us as at time on any day, whether it's 2012 or 2050,\\\" Greg says. \\\"Just having that approach toward life: 'Well, a comet could hit us. Life could end right now. How do we want to live our lives?' It poses that question.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bouncing Souls may not have expressed this sentiment in this way before, but the band, which was formed during high school by a group of friends, has always embraced it. After forming in high school, the friends moved into a punk house, self-released a seven-inch and headed out on the road. The group's debut, The Good, The Bad & The Argyle, was released in 1994 on their own label, Chunksaah Records. Since then the band has offered up eight albums and countless EPs and splits, and been signed with Epitaph and BYO Records. They've toured extensively, with acts like Green Day and Hot Water Music, and have played more Warped Tour dates than any other band. But in the end it comes down to four friends playing music they like for fans who like it too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You go through so many things and so many life experiences together, so much creative experience together, and I think having a record come out from a group that's been together for so long is special,\\\" Greg notes. \\\"After 25 years of being in a band we spent a couple weeks in a basement and just had a great time. I think that's a huge achievement.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nComet does, in fact, originate from a basement. Last year, the members of The Bouncing Souls decided to get together and write ten songs for what would become a follow-up to 2010's Ghosts On the Boardwalk, an album that compiled tracks released over the course of a year. This would be the first real cohesive release since 2006's The Gold Record and the musicians wanted to go back to the way it started, just them in a basement writing songs into a tape recorder. This meant that by the time the band went into the studio in January the ten tracks that make up Comet were almost completely done. The recording took place in Fort Collins, CO at The Blasting Room with Bill Stevenson, a musician and producer The Bouncing Souls had known forever but somehow never worked with. In total, the recording and mixing process lasted only 12 days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This album began as a conversation about how we felt an element of true and urgent inspiration had gone missing lately, and that if we were to write another album, it needed to be truly inspired, written out of a pure need to express something,\\\" Bryan explains. \\\"Having tried writing songs every different way, and on every different size budget, we realized that much of our best stuff was written in next to no time and without any real money involved.  We decided to give ourselves ten days to pull an album together. Ten songs in as many days\u2014 no fluff, all blood and guts, like it was in the Maniacal Laughter days. Plus, without Bill Stevenson, there would have been no Descendants, and therefore no Bouncing Souls. I really for the life of me can't believe it took us this long to work with Bill.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Recording with Bill was great,\\\" Pete adds. \\\"He has been writing and recording great songs for decades. That guy knows what he's doing. He knows how to write a song and how to make everything sound right from every angle. He totally understood what we were striving for and put his whole self into it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resulting album, which will come out as a joint release between Chunksaah and Rise Records, is a dynamic, impassioned collection of melodic punk rock songs that showcase a group working at its best. It veers from insightful social awareness to the group's signature love songs: First single \\\"Static,\\\" a propulsive rocker, \\\"acknowledges the lack of humanity that's going on in music and in the media,\\\" while the aforementioned title track urges the listener to seize the day. The album, which will be released on 6-12-12, six years after The Gold Record came out on 6-6-06, is, ultimately, The Bouncing Souls, the next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We've lived life more,\\\" Greg says. \\\"We've had more experiences. So it's the same subjects, but from a different perspective. That's what makes each record an evolution. We've done three-chord punk songs the whole way, but new angles have emerged as we've gone along.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I feel lucky every day to have been a part of this band for so long,\\\" Pete says. \\\"It has enhanced my life in so many ways I couldn't even start to list. Being able to be a part of something that allows you to express yourself and to be creative while being around your favorite people in the world is something that I feel thankful for every day and I think that shows on this album.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":750,\"height\":495},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":750,\"height\":495},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":198},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":198},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":132},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":132},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-og.jpg\",\"width\":750,\"height\":495},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":330},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":330},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":429},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/95/39-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":429}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bouncingsouls.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/bouncingsouls\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/bouncingsouls\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/bouncingsoulsnj\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"bouncingsoulsnj\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":802529,\"name\":\"Masked Intruder\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Straight outa Rikers. Straight outa Cook County, straight outa that prison in Louisiana that everyone says is horrible, but I can't be bothered to Google, it's MASKED INTRUDER, four melodious felons in ski masks with rap sheets, matching converse and some of the catchiest tunes this side of Johnny Cash, Live in Folsom Prison, and they're coming at you with their second full length, the semi eponymously titled M.I., scheduled to break out on Fat Wreck Chords on May 27, 2014. \\nSome say they hail from Wisconsin, some say their accents on stage betray a New Jersey heritage and some people think they're just Chixdiggit in disguise, but one thing's for sure, Blue and the gang have been crafting some of the sweetest pop-punk gems about breaking and entering, stalking, and muggings that you've ever heard. Not many grown men in ski masks can claim to be the very favorite band of Fat Mike's daughter, for example (not many men in ski masks should be around children at all) but that's what makes Masked Intruder so special. They're more than a gimmick. They've got chops. They're weird, kinda arty, fairly goofy, vaguely dumb, relentlessly smart and they appeal to pretty much everyone, from their fellow hardened criminals to little girls and everyone in between. \\nNow, they're back on the lam in support of M.I., featuring thirteen tracks of broken hearts, broken promises and breaking and entering. Recorded by Matt Alison at Atlas Studios in Chicago (Alkaline Trio, Lawrence Arms, Menzingers), M.I. boasts the Intruders at their toe tapping, jewelry stealing best. I mean, if there's a better title for a love song than Don't Run Away, I sure as hell haven't heard it. \\nIn support of M.I., and in order to stay a step ahead of their parole officers, the Intruder duders are hitting the road nonstop, traversing the globe, from Europe to Australia to the US of A, with bands like the Dwarves, Face To Face and more, bringing their heart-stealing songs to the people, all while merch dude, stage security and exquisitely mustached lawman Officer Bradford makes sure that hearts are the only things Masked Intruder steals. Officer Bradford may not wear a smile during a Masked Intruder show, but everyone else in the house sure is, and you can bet your ass that whether live or on record, the boys in Masked Intruder are sure to have you singing along and looking for your wallet. Oh, that prison in Louisiana is called Angola. Score one for memory.

Having put out numerous releases and toured the country dozens of times the band are about to release Home, their best-sounding album to date which takes the group's sound to the next level without sacrificing the palpable passion that's made them underground favorites.\\n\\nOff With Their Heads is the project of Minneapolis native Ryan Young and on Home he's joined by drummer Justin Francis and bassist Robbie Swartwood, the latter of whom has been playing with the group for nearly five years. \\\"It's hard to bring people into a full-time touring punk band because you have to be a musician not someone who is doing this for a hobby,\\\" Young admits. \\\"An actual musician is the type of person who does this because it's what they do. Money is always nice but you have to expect nothing and still play like you care.\\\"\\n\\nFor their second release on Epitaph the band teamed up with one of Young's heroes, Descendents' drummer Bill Stevenson who produced the album at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado\u2014and the result is an album that captures the raw passion of Off With Their Heads' live shows without obscuring any of the instrumentation with a slick, studio sheen. \\\"It was really important that this record didn't sound too polished so once we agreed on a general sound of the record it was great,\\\" Young explains. \\\"It's definitely the best-sounding record that we've done.\\\"\\n\\nHome is also the strongest collection of Off With Their Heads' songs to date and certainly the most diverse. From the instantly catchy sing-alongs of \\\"Shirts\\\" to straight-ahead, Ramones-influenced ragers like \\\"Seek Advise Elsewhere\\\" and stripped-down ballads like \\\"Don't' Make Me Go,\\\" Home shows how much the band have grown sonically since their last release, a development that is no doubt due to the fact that the band have spent so much time on the road touring with everyone from Municipal Waste to Kind Of Like Spitting in everything from massive theaters to basements.\\n\\nIf there's a lyrical theme on Home, it's personal experiences whether that ranges from struggles with identity (\\\"I don't feel like me, whatever that's supposed to be\\\" from \\\"Shirts\\\") to tales from the road. However as you might expect it all comes back to the fact that for a full-time touring punk rocker the word \\\"home\\\" has a very unique connotation. \\\"I think I used to take for granted the simple notion of having an apartment in Minneapolis,\\\" Young explains. \\\"The album is about the bad feelings associated with being at home, why people leave home, and how important it is to have a good one.\\\"\\n\\nOver the course of these twelve songs Young expresses that sentiment in different ways and the content on the disc explores everything from being oppressed because of one's sexuality (\\\"Focus on Your Own Family\\\") in addition to more personal writing that exposes Young's own misgivings about the Catholic church and the impact it's had on his family life (\\\"Altar Boy\\\"). Then there's a song like \\\"Don't Make Me Go\\\" which guest vocalist Tony Kovacs from Shot Baker summarized telling the band, \\\"OWTH has a story and this explains a lot.\\\" Listening to the impassioned track, it's evident why this is true.\\n\\nHaving toured with everyone from Bad Religion to the Dropkick Murphys, Young has learned that in order for him to maintain his ethics he tells his bandmates that \\\"playing a show in front of 6,000 people is no different than playing a house show\\\" and you can tell by the group's countless live performances that this isn't just lip service. \\\"I'm proud that I have pretty much maintained my core beliefs over the years,\\\" he explains. \\\"Opening for my heroes is cool but that's their crowd and I have always been about carving my own part through all of this.\\\"\\n\\nDespite the fact that Off With Their Heads have performed everywhere from Jacksonville to Japan over the past decade, it's clear that even if OWTH never left Minneapolis they would be doing the exact same thing just as passionately. \\\"Everything involved with this band has become larger and more successful than I could have hoped for,\\\" Young admits, citing signing to Epitaph as one of these milestones. \\\"The only goals I have for myself and OWTH is to continue to make music that I care about, try to push myself physically and musically and continue to be able to do what I love for a living.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":638},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":680},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":332},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":332},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":432},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/60/26/89-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":432}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.epitaph.com/artists/artist/275/Off_With_Their_Heads#albdesc\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/offwiththeirheads\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/owth42069\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/owth\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"owth\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.leespalace.com/event/1324993?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
