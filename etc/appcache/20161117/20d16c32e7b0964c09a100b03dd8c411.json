Child\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Wild Child doesn\u2019 t want a place to hide. Song after song, town after town, they\u2019 ll wear their hearts on their sleeves, addicted to the rush that only comes when thousands of strangers know all your secrets and sing them back to you, because they\u2019 re their secrets, too.  \u201cIt's not necessarily the performing that's addictive, but being able to connect with that many people at once,\u201d says Kelsey Wilson, who shares lead vocal and songwriting responsibilities with Alexander Beggins. \u201cYou feel like you're together in something\u2013\u2013like you experience the whole thing together. It\u2019 s family therapy with a lot of dancing.\u201dWild Child\u2019 s third album Foolsis an ambitious collection of lush pop that takes sad stories and transforms them into an ebullient love letter to the power of music, and the art of living with yourself.  Made up of the core duo of Kelsey (violin and vocals) and Alexander (ukulele and vocals), together with a talented five-piece band, the Austin-based Wild Child has built a sprawling grassroots following on the strength of two charming albums, as well as high-spirited live shows that feel like self-contained joy benders. 2011\u2019 s debut album Pillow Talk notched four no. 1 singles on indie pulse monitor Hype Machine, spurred on by music bloggers who fell early and hard for the ebullient group. 2013\u2019 s The Runaround upped the ante, making best-of lists and garnering glowing reviews and write-ups from NPR, Paste, Popmatters, and many others. Then Wild Child hit TV, performing on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and serving as the featured artists on CBS Saturday Morning. Since forming five years ago when Kelsey and Alexander met during a stint as members of a backup band for a Danish artist\u2019 s U.S. tour, Wild Child has gone from playing shows for nine people to selling out venues across North America and Europe.  Not bad for an indie outfit who, up until now, has been thriving without radio spins or record label muscle. And it all started when two Texas kids too scared to sing for crowds discovered they wrote hauntingly good songs together. Wild Child recorded Fools at Doll House Studios in Savannah, Georgia. Produced by Peter Mavrogeorgis and David Plakon with additional tracks helmed by red-letter guest producers Max Frost (\u201cBreak Bones\u201d) and Chris \\\"Frenchie\\\" Smith (\u201cTrillo Talk\u201d), Fools reveals that while the band has grown up to become fiercely skilled musicians who have charmed the world, their faces remain grinning and often painted, spirits stubborn and free, barbs sharp and cathartic.  While writing for the album, Kelsey split from her fianc\u00e9 of five years, then watched as her parents divorced. \u201cIt was the first time that I'd ever had writer\u2019 s block,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWithin a week, all of the lyrics just came out.\u201d\u201cShe used this album as a platform to say a lot of things she wanted to say,\u201d Alexander says. \u201cIt's a story that's not exactly linear, but you hear someone going through something.\u201dKelsey and Alexander co-wrote all of the record\u2019 s songs, while the title track was penned together with the entire band\u2013\u2013a first for the group. A complexly layered, funky gem, \u201cFools\u201d saunters as Kelsey and Alexander sigh, \u201cIf you have to go / I\u2019 ll play the fool,\u201d a sly acknowledgement that no matter what else is going on in the relationship, it\u2019 d be easier to hold on than to let it fall apart. The act of consciously playing the fool shows up repeatedly throughout the record, and Wild Child flaunts a postmodern comfort with perspective\u2019 s slippery grip on truth. \u201cThe Cracks\u201d pulses with uncertainty as Kelsey delicately cries, \u201cYou went too far, went way too far / We went too far, went way too far;\u201d while in \u201cBullets,\u201d she croons, \u201cI know you think I took a lot from you.\u201d\u201cMeadows\u201d asks a lover how much they\u2019 re willing to sacrifice, while \u201cTake It\u201d and \u201cReno\u201d tackle separation and trust. The sole purely exuberant note on the album, \u201cBad Girl\u201d is a Motown-inspired celebration of the birth of Kelsey\u2019 s first niece. \u201cOklahoma,\u201d a harmony-soaked strings showcase that kicks off with an electro-pop tease, was slated for The Runaround but didn\u2019 t quite fit until Fools. Originally intended for Pillow Talk, \u201cStones\u201d was mined from lyrics Kelsey penned when she was only 15 years old. Now, it\u2019 s part bubbly piano-man ramble, part sweeping string-led drama, and capped off by a brassy New Orleans breakdown\u2013\u2013a perfect example of the Wild Child\u2019 s increasingly virtuosic ability to stretch and crisply fold genres into their ever-expanding repertoire.  \u201cBreak Bones\u201d is a stunner\u2013\u2013a big, bold, beautiful pop song praying a fight continues indefinitely, because that\u2019 s all that\u2019 s left. \u201cTrillo Talk,\u201d a last minute addition to the record and an ideal closer, winks to previous album fan favorites \u201cPillow Talk\u201dand \u201cRillo Talk,\u201d and soars triumphantly. \u201cIt\u2019 s the last thought\u2013\u2013everything is going to be okay...but it's not. But, it feels alright,\u201d Alexander says. \\r\\nVocally, Alexander strolls \u2013 steady and wry \u2013as Kelsey skips, runs, and hops, all whirly energy and instinctive phrasing. \u201cI think my voice just sits nice underneath hers,\u201d Alexander says, simply and accurately. \u201cThe two of us never really intended to be singers and still don't really consider ourselves singers,\u201d says Kelsey, without a hint of irony. NPR\u2019s Ann Powers likened her voice to that of a \u201cJazz Age Broadway baby,\u201d but bring up that and other praise, and Kelsey just laughs and emphasizes, \u201cI don't think of myself as a singer. I think of it just like talking. We're just having a conversation.\u201dIn their musical repartee, Wild Child doesn\u2019 t pull punches. Their songs sting as they groove, the scutting lyrics massaged by cooing vocals and bouncy ukulele. So we\u2019 re dancing and laughing before we realize we\u2019 ve got tears in our eyes, entranced by Wild Child\u2019 s dizzying contradiction: sour truths that sound so sweet. \u201cThe instruments may belong in a granola commercial, but what we're saying is often dark and angry and bitter,\u201d says Kelsey. \u201cIt wasn't until Alexander and I started writing music together that we were like, \u2018 Damn. Are we sad?\u2019\u201d\u201cThere is a beauty in lyric writing that is almost too honest,\u201d Alexander says. \u201cWe've always tried to poke holes in that terrible thing that nobody really wants to think about.\u201dFools is an unashamed breakup album, but it\u2019 s more than last rites for lovers. The record also bids farewell to the traditional lives Kelsey and Alexander had thought lie in store.  \u201cWe're about to live day to day for a long time, and our relationships are going to fall apart,\u201d Kelsey says. \u201cOur home lives are going to fall apart. And there's nothing we can do about it. So, the record is also about letting go of expectations, just playing the fool. Fools is a release\u2013\u2013a blind step out.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":178,\"height\":178},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":178,\"height\":178},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":178,\"height\":178},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":178,\"height\":178},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":178,\"height\":178},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-og.jpg\",\"width\":178,\"height\":178},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":178,\"height\":178},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":178,\"height\":178},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":178,\"height\":178},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/18/71/23-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":178,\"height\":178}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.wildchild.info\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/wildchildtheband\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/events/406330762841528/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/wildchildsounds\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"wildchildsounds\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1722083,\"name\":\"Walker Lukens\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Dear Reader,\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Never Understood EP was written in Austin, Texas throughout 2015, mostly in my garage (honorable mention to my living room.) Without my iPhone Voice Memo app, lots of performing around the country to half empty rooms, the Nick Cave ACL taping, Adderall, Tecate, and The Savage Detectives, none of these songs would have come about.\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Eno produced and recorded these songs at his studio, Public Hi Fi. I met Jim at a bar (Austin! what a town!) and now we've recorded an entire album's worth of songs (and then some!) The plan had been to Beyonce-drop a double album some time in the next 13 years and call it Chinese Democracy Revisited or Chinese Democracy II. But, frankly, my hair isn't that red nor can my bank account handle so much anticipation. Hence, the Never Understood EP. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe songs were performed and arranged by my favorite band of sweet and tender hooligans, The Side Arms. (We'll be touring for infinity so be on the look out!) I take some pride in the fact that I got Eno to play keyboards on the song 'Never Understood' since he's a drummer. \\r\\n\\r\\nI hope when people listen to this record they think, 'damn, this guy is hungry. He sounds like he's been fasting for months, meditating on his songs. He's somewhere passed hangry. He could use a steak. He's pumping and thumping in time. The green light flashes, the flags go up.
