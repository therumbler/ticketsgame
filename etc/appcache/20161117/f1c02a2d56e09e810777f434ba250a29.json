Their eighth full-length offering and second for Razor & Tie, The Return, is no exception either. After 17 years in the game, the Florida quintet sustains the same energy that sparked its foundation back in 1997. The riffs crack with neck-snapping intensity, the bass and drums forge an unmatched groove, and the vocals rapidly recount stories of pain and perseverance. The Return remains as raw, ripping, and real as these musicians\u2014Elias Soriano [vocals], Robb Rivera [drums], Rasheed Thomas [guitar], Adam Woloszyn [bass], and B.C. Kochmit [guitar]\u2014get.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2013, Nonpoint closed out a year of touring behind 2012's self-titled record, which yielded the Active Rock radio hit \\\"Left For You.\\\" Fueled by that continued success and their time on the road, they immediately began writing for album number eight. This time around, the band amped ups the aggression musically, while Elias drew inspiration from a whole new well altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I was listening to a lot of hip-hop,\\\" he remembers. \\\"When I finished listening to Kendrick Lamar's album good kid, m.A.A.d city, I felt like I knew the guy. That invigorated my creative flow. At the same time, Eminem does things lyrically and phonetically that challenge everybody on The Marshall Mathers LP 2. They both made some bold statements, and it gave me permission to go back in that direction. I wanted to play with vocal patterns and tell longer stories in some places, while saying very little in others. The record has its own DNA because each song respectively does as well.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2014, with this mindset, the guys entered Groovemaster Studios with Grammy Award-nominated producer Johnny K [Disturbed, Staind, Megadeth] and engineer Daniel Salcidoto. It marked their second collaboration together, and this time, the band had already amassed an arsenal of tight and tough material.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobb goes on, \\\"Johnny is like the sixth member of our band at this point! He works us, and he pulls no punches. It was such a natural thing that we only needed to track for three weeks. Johnny understands the band and what we are, and he encourages us to be ourselves.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only does The Return match the pristine sonic power of Nonpoint, but the songs stand out as some of their catchiest and most crushing output to date. The first single \\\"Breaking Skin\\\" pierces with sharp and slick guitars before catapulting into a catchy chorus, punctuated by the vocalist's punchy delivery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It's about addiction, whether it be food, drugs, sex, lying, or anything,\\\" explains Elias. \\\"That tends to turn into an itch. You can't stop scratching it so you break skin. Then, you're bleeding. You need to get help at that point and deal with it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRobb adds, \\\"'Breaking Skin' is a different kind of song for us. There's a lot of melody, but it's still so heavy. That heaviness has always been in the back of our minds. It's a natural direction for us. Most bands soften their sound as they go on. We get more aggressive and heavy. That's what Nonpoint does best.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the record opens up with the taut thrashing of \\\"Pins and Needles,\\\" which Elias describes as \\\"That moment where you say something very candid to an opposing party, and you know you're going to get a reaction. You only want to retaliate, waiting to pounce.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Razors\\\" cuts deep with a bludgeoning and brutal stomp, and the title track captures a strong and rather crucial message for the singer. He continues, \\\"When you look back in your past, you always will find people who didn't believe in what you were doing at the beginning. They end up coming around full circle later. Watching them come back is an interesting feeling. You can be a dick about it, or you can just be happy and live your life. That song is about opening the door and holding the proverbial slice of crow for them to eat high above your head.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA vital energy has coursed through Nonpoint's music since day one. As a result, they've sold over 800,000 albums in North America alone, yielding hits including \\\"What A Day\\\", \\\"Bullet With A Name\\\", and a cover of Phil Collins' \\\"In The Air Tonight\\\"\u2014which appeared in Miami Vice. They've also crisscrossed the country with everybody from Stone Sour, Disturbed, and Papa Roach to Sevendust, All That Remains, and Device, also appearing at festivals including OZZfest, Rock on the Range, and Summerfest.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, Nonpoint once again delivers a cohesive collection of powerful songs. \\\"I want everybody to feel like they got a complete record from beginning to end,\\\" concludes Elias. \\\"I want them to walk away with something substantial and true that they can hopefully come back to.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRobb leaves off, \\\"Nonpoint has always been known for writing songs that help people. If we can help even one person feel better about his or her day, we've done well, as far as I'm concerned. I hope everybody gets something positive and can walk away with a smile.\\\"\\r\\nThen they'll return for more\u2026\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":517},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":517},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":162},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":162},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":108},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":108},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":517},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":54},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":54},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":269},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":269},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":350},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/45-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":350}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"WKt2qvW9IWA\",\"title\":\"Nonpoint - I Said It (Official Music Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKt2qvW9IWA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"9gLL3CQ9_yk\",\"title\":\"Nonpoint - Breaking Skin (Official Music Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gLL3CQ9_yk\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WKt2qvW9IWA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.nonpoint.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/nonpoint\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/nonpointworld\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/nonpoint\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"nonpoint\"},{\"id\":1659415,\"name\":\"Escape The Fate\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Formed in 2004, Las Vegas post-hardcore group Escape the Fate prided itself, above all else, on an energetic and visceral live show. Following the demise of their previous band, singer Ronnie Radke and bassist Max Green recruited keyboardist Carson Allen, guitarist Omar Espinoza, and drummer Robert Ortiz. Debuting live barely one month after forming, the band found early success via local radio outlets and quickly amassed a devoted hometown following.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's No Sympathy for the Dead By September 2005, Escape the Fate had won a local radio contest judged by My Chemical Romance. The gig awarded them the opportunity to open a show on the band's headlining tour with Alkaline Trio and Reggie & the Full Effect, which subsequently led to a record deal with Epitaph. Their five-song EP, There's No Sympathy for the Dead, appeared in May 2006 with their full-length debut, Dying Is Your Latest Fashion, following in September of that year. Prior to both releases, keyboardist Allen left the band, with guitarist Espinoza also leaving amicably in 2007 after the two releases. The lineup shifts continued as singer Radke was ousted in 2008 due to continued drug problems and his involvement in an altercation that led to an indictment on a charge of battery. The remaining members recruited former blessthefall vocalist Craig Mabbitt to fill the vacant frontman position, and the revised lineup immediately hit the studio in mid-2008 to record their sophomore album, This War Is Ours, which subsequently reached number 35 on the Billboard charts that October. The album was a departure from Escape the Fate's earlier emo-inspired sound, and featured a more streamlined, hard rock approach. They immersed themselves in a heavy touring schedule and, in early 2010, began working with producer Don Gilmore (Linkin Park, Bullet for My Valentine) on their third LP. Released later that year, the self-titled album would be their first for DGC/Interscope and fared well commercially, entering the charts at number 25.\\r\\n\\r\\nUngrateful They continued to tour heavily, playing shows around the world before releasing their follow-up album, 2013's Ungrateful. Their ever-shifting lineup continued to evolve with founding member Green departing and his replacement TJ Bell taking over on bass. Brothers Monte and Michael Money manned the guitars and in addition to the lineup changes, Ungrateful also saw a shift to a different label, this time coming out on Universal imprint Eleven Seven Music. Arriving in late 2015, Escape the Fate's fifth album, Hate Me, was helmed by veteran producer Howard Benson (My Chemical Romance, Bon Jovi, Daughtry).\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":399},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":399},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-og.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":399},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":399},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/47-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":399}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"XleCTkNECko\",\"title\":\"Escape The Fate - Remember Every Scar\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XleCTkNECko\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"F1qX5IX7Gsk\",\"title\":\"Escape The Fate - Picture Perfect\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1qX5IX7Gsk\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"SNArTXVWZns\",\"title\":\"Escape the Fate - One For The Money\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SNArTXVWZns\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XleCTkNECko\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.escapethefate.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/escapethefate\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/escapethefate\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/escapethefate\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"escapethefate\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1659417,\"name\":\"Get Scared\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"We started the band with the motive to not be another mundane closed minded group of musicians.

The Greensboro, NC quintet\u2014JD [vocals], Ryan [bass, backup vocals], Kile [guitar], Zane [drums], and Wil [rhythm guitars]\u2014architect eleven impactful, invigorating, and infectious anthems with hooks so robust that modern bells and whistles just aren't necessary. It's a tried-and-true approach that feels timeless as the boys make hard rock hypnotic again. Like a big screen blockbuster you can't turn away from, they don't waste any time reaching the climax either\u2026\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group began to take shape in the summer of 2013. While working at a local Greensboro studio alongside his friend Drew Fulk and assistant engineer Zane, Kile penned his own music. He spent the day handling recording for everybody from Nightmares to Cane Hill and producing and co-writing with the likes of Motionless In White, while nights were devoted to a new project with Zane, Wil, and Ryan. After watching a Facebook video of JD covering Matt Anderson's \\\"Coal Mining Blues,\\\" Kile reached out to the vocalist. In between his career as an esteemed chef working under the likes of Wolfgang Puck and Gino Angelini and serving as a Naval Culinary Specialist, JD continually wrote music and performed. However, he returned to South Carolina from a stint in California at just the right moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I saw that video, and I called him,\\\" Kile recalls. \\\"It just made sense because his voice instantly worked with everything we were doing. Everybody felt that it was something special.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This is family,\\\" adds Wil. \\\"Kile and I have been friends and played guitar together for over ten years. We've all played in numerous bands around town, and we've known each other. We all knew JD too, and it simply worked.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'd known Kile for over ten years at that point,\\\" says JD. \\\"He recorded my previous band Written In Blood. I'd been on a journey\u2014living like a gypsy and cooking food. I came back to South Carolina to take care of my mother who had just been diagnosed with cancer. It was a crazy coincidence that I was back and Kile was doing a rock band. The stars truly aligned.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJoining forces with influential rock manager Larry Mazer, Failure Anthem began to build a passionate regional fan base. They supported Halestorm and Scott Stapp at packed shows and eventually caught the attention of Razor & Tie. With Kile and Drew overseeing production, mixing, and mastering, the band wrote and recorded First World Problems in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nZane exclaims, \\\"Our love for making great rock songs drew us together. We all come from very different backgrounds musically and stylistically, but as a band, we mesh really well, have found of our own, and have a great time doing it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Obviously, we're a rock band,\\\" declares Kile. \\\"There are a bunch of influences going on in there. We'll have hints of metal and even an electronic side.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, a sonic barrage fuels the title track. Augmented by pinch harmonic squeals, intense rhythms, and an overpowering refrain, \\\"First World Problems\\\" properly introduces Failure Anthem to the unsuspecting masses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The song is a satirical look at how people complain about the most unimportant things\u2014like their latte being wrong or not having cell phone service,\\\" explains Kile. \\\"It's a very real issue for this day and age.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I ended up living in a homeless shelter when I was in L.A.,\\\" sighs JD. \\\"It's a hard time living on the streets, and you see what real problems are as opposed to First World Problems. This track is a song for us. It's tough-as-nails and edgy. It punches people in the face and gives them truth.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the powerful \\\"Paralyzed\\\" breaks from an anthemic chorus into a searing solo. \\\"It's a love song about finding yourself within another person,\\\" JD goes on. \\\"Everything just means more once you find that significant other. I think everybody can feel that.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere, \\\"Leap of Faith\\\" urges honesty with oneself over a thick wall of distortion. The band also open up immensely on the soaring ballad \\\"Here for Good,\\\" which Kile aptly describes as, \\\"your straightforward love song about being committed to a person and assuring her that no matter how hard things get, you'll fight through it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat fighting mentality is encased within the group's moniker. Ryan explains, \\\"As a band name, mantra, and mindset, Failure Anthem just reminds me that we all have struggles and failures in life, but all we can do is turn them into opportunities to learn and grow from.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Failure Anthem has an underdog meaning,\\\" says Kile. \\\"It's the outlier concept. The person who is allegedly not built to succeed is actually the one who comes out on top. That message is in the music.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWil agrees, \\\"I want everyone to find something in our songs that represents a piece of their own story. Our record is a roller coaster of aggression, passion, devastation, loss, gain, triumph, and happiness.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Failure Anthem, it's all about sharing that uplifting message via the songs in the end. \\\"I'd like for people to gain inspiration, knowledge, and strength when they listen to Failure Anthem,\\\" JD concludes. \\\"It's meant to push you through the day.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's the point of all great rock music\u2026\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":632,\"height\":632},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-og.jpg\",\"width\":632,\"height\":632},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":632,\"height\":632},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/21/62/83-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"9b1R3jqUCP4\",\"title\":\"Failure Anthem - Paralyzed (Official Music Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9b1R3jqUCP4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"FI0eikHnqKk\",\"title\":\"Failure Anthem - First World Problems (Official Video)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FI0eikHnqKk\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9b1R3jqUCP4\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://failureanthem.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/FailureAnthem\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/failureanthem\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"failureanthem\"},{\"id\":1715643,\"name\":\"INNRCOR\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The CorePowerful, high energy, dedicated, and driven, are all words that are synonymous with the band InnrCor.
