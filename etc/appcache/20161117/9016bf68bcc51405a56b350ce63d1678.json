While also considering the equally ridiculous \\\"Wanker Daddies,\\\" \\\"Shrinky Dinks,\\\" and \\\"Cookie Puss,\\\" it was the title \\\"Mustard Plug\\\" that was chosen as the masthead to carry forth in the band's crusade to bring ska-punk to their humble abode of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Twenty years, 1500 shows and 200,000 album sales later, it can not be denied that the band has surpassed all expectations and permanently staked their claim in contemporary music.\\r\\n\\r\\nMustard Plug started out in the punk clubs, basements and dive bars of the Midwest, playing punk influenced ska music during a time most people in the U.S. had never even heard of ska.  They clung to a DIY work ethic that had been ingrained in them from growing up in the 1980's hardcore punk scene and applied it to everything they'd do for the next 20 years.  They released their first cassette tape themselves (1992's Skapocalypse Now!), and played constantly to earn enough money to record their first cd.  1994's Big Daddy Mulititude was released on legendary NYC label Moon Records and with their new found national distribution and exposure, the band climbed into their van and performed their music to new fans across North America.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996 the band went to the Blasting Room in Ft. Collins, Colorado to record their second cd with their hero, punk legend Bill Stevenson, who at that time had been mainly known as the drummer for the Descendents and Black Flag.  This album, Evildoers Beware, was quickly picked up by the then up and coming L.A. punk label, Hopeless Records, and released just as ska-punk music was finally gaining mainstream exposure in the U.S.   Evildoers Beware exposed the band to a broader fan base, outside their midwest roots and the international ska die-hards who had thus far rallied around the band.  The late 90's became a blur as they hit the road, playing 150 shows a year and opening tours for the likes of Face to Face, The Bouncing Souls, Hepcat, MXPX, Less Than Jake, and many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, the band recorded their version of the Verve Pipe's \\\"The Freshmen\\\" for a local radio compilation.  Their version infused ska-punk energy in to a top 40 pop classic and immediately got picked up by several large commercial radio stations coast to coast and became a fan favorite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band's momentum continued to grow, allowing them to headline tours throughout North American and eventually Europe, Japan, and Brazil, and play to huge crowds at seminal clubs like CBGB's in NYC, the Metro in Chicago, Emo's in Austin and The Whiskey in L.A.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of the 90's the band returned to the Blasting Room to record the critically acclaimed Pray For Mojo and continued to hit the road constantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the new millennium, the band continued their mission of bringing their music to the masses.  Despite ska music's fall from grace, the band returned to their grass roots base and continued to tour. In 2003, they released the ska-punk gem Yellow #5, this time going to Detroit to self produce and record it.  In 2004 the band turned the public's perception of ska on it's head by co-headling the initial run of the Ska Is Dead Tour, playing in front of packed concert halls from coast to coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the band returned to the Blasting Room to record In Black and White. The album was hailed by many as a return to form, while creating a modern take on the ska-punk genre.  Since then the band has continued to tour internationally and write new songs.  Several new singles have been released including split 7 inches with Bomb the Music Industry and Montreal's The Beatdown.  During the past year, the band has continued to hit the road, including a tour of Europe that saw them at Belgium's massive Groezrock Festival and conquering the 1500th show benchmark in the U.S. The band continues to write songs for an upcoming album.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mustard Plug looks back over their twenty years of relentless touring and recording, they are proud of their accomplishments and see no reason to slow down.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":700,\"height\":1082},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":464},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":309},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-og.jpg\",\"width\":700,\"height\":1082},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":155},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":773},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":1005},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/30/19-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.mustardplug.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/mustardplug\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/mustardplug\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/mustard_plug\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"mustard_plug\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":534829,\"name\":\"Rude King\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Dallas, TX ska!!!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":427},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":427},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-og.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":427},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":427},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/69-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":427}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.rudeking.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/RudeKingSka\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":603791,\"name\":\"The Holophonics\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The Holophonics were founded in the fall of 2012 by Eric Daino, a veteran of the early 2000s East Coast ska scene, after relocating to Denton, TX to study music at The University of North Texas. Eric joined forces with former Orange County, CA rude boy and fellow UNT student Shane Reider and recruited bastions of the Denton math rock scene Harrell Petersen, Will Huebner, and Tyler Waguespack to fill out a compact yet extremely versatile ska lineup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Holophonics have played extensively varied shows throughout the Dallas-Ft. Worth metro area and beyond. The core of The Holophonics' formula is one of adaptability; as a DIY ska punk band, the group has burned through small living room shows from Denton, TX to Tacoma, WA and many locations in between performing songs from their debut original full length recording \\\"Third Wave Undead\\\" with blazing intensity and irresistible sing-along captivation. The Holophonics continue to build a following with their nostalgic recollection of 90's Third Wave Ska and recently opened for Voodoo Glow Skulls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut The Holophonics have another angle on ska, and as a ska/reggae cover band with an ever growing catalog of 50+ rock and pop songs, The Holophonics are able to reach even larger audiences all around the world. The MaSKArades series of cover recordings is amassing a large radio and online following, and as a cover band The Holophonics have played live music venues and bars across DFW and the west coast, including performing for thousands as a featured cover band at Disneyland in Anaheim, CA. Recently, The Holophonics gave a reggae cover performance in Sunset Beach, CA for Reggae For Reason, the charity organization dedicated to ending youth homelessness abroad run by Fully Fullwood, former bassist for Bob Marley and The Wailers.\\r\\n\\r\\nReleasing 2 full length albums and a Holiday EP in just 6 months, The Holophonics have a work ethic paralleled by few other bands. Eric self records and releases all of The Holophonics' material on Holophonor Records, his independent record label and home studio. Keeping the recording process DIY allows for lower overhead costs and quicker releases. The Holophonics will start recording \\\"MaSKArades Vol. 3\\\", a new full length album of cover songs, in late Summer 2013.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":946},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":296},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":197},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":946},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":99},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":493},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":641},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/71/48/81-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/theholophonics\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.threelinksdeepellum.com/event/1364865?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
