Whether he is with his Souldiggers group or simply solo with an acoustic guitar, Geoff\u2019s infectious and inventive style has earned him fans around the world.\\r\\n***\\r\\nHe began playing in his father's dance band at the age of 13. He developed a passion for American blues and learned the rudiments of the art form.  In his early 20s he moved to Melbourne and joined with legendary local bluesman 'Dutch' Tilders. After several years with Dutch he departed to focus on his own music and embarked on an international campaign. \\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\nHis first stop was the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, USA where he won the 'Albert King Award' and was offered an endorsement deal with Gibson Guitars. \\r\\n***\\r\\nGeoff\u2019s tri-continental touring schedule includes Australia, Europe & USA\\r\\n***\\r\\nHe re-located to the USA for a time and he spent many months on the road performing countless live shows and recording his One Ticket, One Ride album there. In 2008 a Guitar Player magazine reader\u2019s poll listed Geoff as one of the Top 10 \u2018Hot New Guitarists\u2019 on the US scene. He adores jamming with other musicians and has developed close musical relationships with many other artists including Georgia based songwriter/musician Randall Bramblett with whom he shares a \u2018live\u2019 album release, Jammin\u2019 In The Attic. His annual Boxing Day Blues concert with Australian bluesman Chris Wilson has also resulted in a shared album release titled Box Of Blues. The passion for jamming has paid off on a personal level too with Geoff being invited onstage at various times with musical heroes such as Hubert Sumlin, Delbert McClinton, Jorma Kaukonen, legendary bassist George Porter JR, the Allman Brothers Band and even the great Les Paul.\\r\\n***\\r\\nBesides recording and performing music Geoff also enjoys teaching. He presents guitar workshops on request and is a regular guest instructor at Jorma Kaukonen\u2019s famous Fur Peace Ranch guitar camp in Ohio.\\r\\n***\\r\\nIn recent times his album releases Box Of Blues (with Chris Wilson), the acoustic Live at Burrinja Caf\u00e9 and the electric Live at Guitars Across The Bay scooped the pool at both the 2012 & 2013 \u2018VicTas\u2019 blues awards. Meanwhile, his Little Big Men album has been re-issued in the US & Europe to renewed critical acclaim. Also in 2012 Geoff was named as one of the Top 50 Australian Guitarists in Australian Guitar magazine. \\r\\n***\\r\\nGeoff\u2019s awards include trophies from organisations like the Australian Songwriters Association; \u2018Chain\u2019 Blues Awards and the Melbourne Blues Appreciation Society. (Geoff was named their official \u2018Patron\u2019 in 2011)\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2007 Geoff accepted an offer to relocate to the USA.\\r\\nHe spent 2 eventful years living and working in the US performing with local musicians and racking up thousands of miles on the road. Highlights included jamming with the iconic Les Paul in New York City and being joining legendary R&B vocalist Delbert McClinton aboard his annual Sandy Beaches concert cruise sailing from San Diego to southern Mexico. \\r\\n\\r\\n  After returning to Australia in 2009, the relentless touring continued with regular visits to the USA, UK and Europe. The tireless travel kept fans enthused and gleaned several 'live' cd releases from different corners of the world. The title of his last studio recording was 2009's 'One Ticket, One Ride' - but in more recent times his album releases Box Of Blues (with Chris Wilson), the acoustic Live at Burrinja Caf\u00e9 and the electric Live at Guitars Across The Bay each scooped the pool at both the 2012 & 2013 \u2018VicTas\u2019 blues awards. Meanwhile, his Little Big Men album has been re-issued in the US & Europe to renewed critical acclaim. Also in 2012 Geoff was named as one of the Top 50 Australian Guitarists in Australian Guitar magazine.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1261},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":394},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":263},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-og.jpg\",\"width\":1174,\"height\":1542},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":131},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":657},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":854},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/05/29-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.geoffachison.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1325655?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
