This record is the sound of five people trying to make something they're proud of... And we really are.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-dawn lyrics and lush, late night melodies: twelvefour is the gorgeous second album from Melbourne five-piece THE PAPER KITES. It\u2019s been four years since the quintet first formed and turned heads with EP Woodland (followed up by 2013\u2019s Young North) \u2013 and quickly became one of Australia\u2019s best-loved live acts, particularly with the release of their acclaimed 2013 LP, States. That record delivered favourites such as \u201cSt Clarity,\u201d \u201cA Lesson From Mr Gray\u201d and Young\u201d reaching #17 on Australia\u2019s ARIA Album chart. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\u2019s not just here at home that the bands profile has been building \u2013 with over 150,000 Facebook fans, and with a whopping 20 million views and counting on YouTube, the band have toured across North America under the invite of City And Colour (aka Dallas Green), plus enjoyed a string of sold out international headline dates of their own. Their Australian tours have seen the band play venues such as Sydney\u2019s Enmore Theatre and Melbourne\u2019s Forum and Athenaeum Theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the Melbourne band \u2013 Sam Bentley, Christina Lacy, David Powys, Josh Bentley and Sam Rasmussen \u2013 are back, with an effortless, sprawling listen that explores new terrain to unveil their best work yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe album is a concept record, based around a theory that an artist's creative peak is between the hours of midnight and 4am,\u201d explains front man Sam Bentley, who\u2019d been searching for a theme to shape album #2. A passing comment from a friend back in August 2014 delivered the spark. \u201cThat idea turned into the heart of the project, so every night I'd sit down when the clock ticked over to midnight and just start writing.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two sleepless months Sam worked, reversing his sleep patterns and penning 30 songs in his home studio. \u201cI got to the end and thought, I'm never doing that again,\u201d Sam laughs. Lyrically, twelvefour isn\u2019t about some sort of somnambulist or insomniac blues, however. \u201cYou\u2019re always more melancholy during those hours,\u201d Sam points out, \u201cbut if I could sum up the album it\u2019s about what happens when selfishness and love collide.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTake the title refrain of the golden, harmonica-laden \u201cI\u2019m Lying To You \u2018Cause I\u2019m Lost,\u201d or album opener and first single \u201cElectric Indigo,\u201d with its plea for redemption: \u201cBut you\u2019ve been waiting long enough to let it go / I\u2019ll do you right / \u2018Cause time is just a remedy / Covered in disguise\u201d. (Be sure to check out the video for \u2018Electric Indigo\u2019, starring actress Laura Brent \u2013 The Chronicles Of Narnia, A Few Best Men.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cNeon Crimson\u201d is one of Sam\u2019s favourites, embodying the album\u2019s spirit.  \u201cLate-night isolation, a confession, an apology... The album as a whole is an open letter. Words and melodies written very late at night to attempt to understand the heaviest of choices, which is choosing someone else or yourself,\u201d says Sam.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetermined to capture a bigger, bolder sound, the group travelled to Seattle to record in February 2015 with Grammy-nominated producer Phil Ek (Father John Misty, Manchester Orchestra, Fleet Foxes, The Shins). twelvefour is lush and intimate: think drum  machines, dirtier guitars (\u201cvery much an \u201880s twinge,\u201d Sam insists) mixed with soulful, smooth synth moments \u2013 see closer \u201cToo Late. Plentiful late-night vibes.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRecording in the Pacific Northwest was a joy. The band took up camp in the hip suburb of Ballad for six weeks, while Ek encouraged them to push themselves. \u201cPhil was someone we'd always wanted to work with, but I know he turns a lot of bands down,\u201d says Sam. \u201cWe thought it wasn't necessarily worth asking.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe great thing about working with Phil was that you couldn\u2019t fake it \u2013 he wanted to hear the real thing,\u201d Sam continues, recalling a day the producer chided him after a vocal take. \u201cHe was really honest with us, sometimes brutally, but all in the interest of making a better record. He made a real point about letting things be how they sounded like they wanted to be.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nA visit to the studio of Chris Walla (Death Cab For Cutie) was like being let loose in a gear candy shop, while blood and sweat literally made its way onto the record when bassist/keyboardist Rasmussen cut his hand while laying down \u201cTurns Within Me, Turns Without Me.\u201d \u201cHe cut his hand open playing these weird keys that were attached to cymbals he was slamming together\u2026 all which ended up on take we used.\u201d Track \u201cRevelator Eyes\u201d shows off Lacy\u2019s harmonies, in what Sam describes as \u201ckind of fast, still very lush, kind of sexy\u201d vibe. \u201cShe really loved that song, we were both pushing for it to be on the record.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning home in April, the record was finally done. Fans can also look forward to a special documentary about the making of twelvefour, filmmaker Matthew Cox capturing the entire recording process in all its glory, warts and all: \u201cit\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resulting album is a startling document to a band truly growing into their own: surefooted and focussed. \u201cAs always I hope that the people who listen to our music continue to go along with us. We're really excited to be taking these songs on the road, and bringing everyone up to speed with where we've been.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n www.thepaperkites.com.au\\r\\n www.facebook.com/thepaperkitesband\\r\\nhttps://twitter.com/thepaperkites\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://thepaperkites.com.au/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/thepaperkitesband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/thepaperkites\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"thepaperkites\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1698245,\"name\":\"Horse Thief\",\"startTime\":\"2016-11-17 19:30:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"<iframe width=\\\"450\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/29xkbSSqgOI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nHorse Thief is a purveyor of a panoramic yet nuanced sound, flowing from intimate to anthemic, the mood from vibrant to contemplative, with frontman Cameron Neal\u2019s lyrics ranging from confessional to metaphorical. The result evokes the wide-open spaces of America\u2019s Midwest but infuses the sense of grit and wonderment with edgier emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally founded in Denton, TX, moved to Oklahoma City to attend the Academy of Contemporary Music at the University of Central Oklahoma, from which they recently graduated. The band subsequently signed with the Flaming Lips\u2019 management and soon came to the attention of Bella Union. Though Fear In Bliss was conceived at Horse Thief\u2019s Oklahoma headquarters the band decided to record the album in LA, \u201cto leave our comfort zone of Oklahoma\u201d, and producer Thom Monahan (Devendra Banhart, Vetiver) has helped the band fuse their renowned stage performance with studio quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe over-arching theme to Fear In Bliss is \u201cfinding yourself and what you believe in, and finding the comfort in acknowledging fear. I\u2019ve struggled with anxiety and depression which comes out a lot on the new album. But when everything gets rough, I think there\u2019s always a way to fix it. The biggest thing for me is to give comfort to people, to shed light on the truth that someone is feeling the same way as them.\u201d \\\"Fear in Bliss\\\" available now.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1366},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/62/68-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.horsethiefokc.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/horsethiefokc\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/horsethiefokc\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"horsethiefokc\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ustreetmusichall.com/event/1262321?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
