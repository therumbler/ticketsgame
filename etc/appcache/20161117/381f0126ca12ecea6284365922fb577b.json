Although a newcomer to Hollywood, Holt has quickly stolen the hearts of Disney fans, helping to propel Kickin\u2019 It to the top spot on the network, holding her own as the only female lead on the show. Holt now takes on the lead role of \u2018Lindy Watson\u2019 in the new Disney Channel original series I Didn\u2019t Do It.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolt has been offered amazing opportunities as an emerging young star and musical talent on Disney. She can be heard on the Girl vs. Monster soundtrack with three singles, \u201cNothing\u2019s Going to Stop Me,\u201d \u201cFearless,\u201d and \u201cHad Me at Hello\u201d, which can be found on iTunes as well. \u201cFearless\u201d and \u201cHad Me at Hello\u201d quickly became fan favorites and climbed the charts, with \u201cHad Me at Hello\u201d reaching number one and both regularly appearing on Radio Disney\u2019s Top 30 Countdown. Holt was also featured on the Disney Holiday Playlist with a cover of the iconic holiday song \u201cWinter Wonderland\u201d and her remake of the song \u201cThese Boots Are Made for Walkin\u201d on Shake It Up I \u2665 Dance Soundtrack.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo stranger to the performing arts, Holt got her start at the age of three when her parents saw the passion and love she had for entertaining. She began to attend theater arts camp during the summers and worked with a variety of acting coaches. In her spare time, Holt would perform for her family, putting on plays with her older sister. After signing with her first agent, she quickly began booking commercials with national spots such as Mattel, Hasbro, KidzBop 14 and Bratz. At thirteen years of age, Holt moved to Los Angeles after booking the role of \u2018Kim\u2019 onKickin\u2019 It and recently was seen in the lead role of \u2018Skylar,\u2019 the fearless monster hunter, in the Disney Channel Original Movie Girl vs. Monster, which attracted over five million viewers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolt has two siblings, older sister Morgan and younger brother Cade. The all-around American girl enjoys spending time with her family, friends and her two Yorkshire terrier pups, Scout and Diesel. Although no longer a competitive gymnast, Holt still enjoys practicing gymnastics in her spare time, going to the movies, playing at theme parks (a love for roller coasters), Parkour (a style of free running and jumping), playing the guitar and piano. She looks to Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and Bruno Mars for her musical inspirations. Holt holds St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital close to her heart for the work they do to advance pediatric disease treatment and research, often visiting children in the hospital and bringing a sense of normalcy to their lives.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-og.jpg\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":667},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/07/99/51-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6-x_7ctc-c\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://oliviaholt.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/officialoliviaholt?_rdr\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/olivia_holt\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"olivia_holt\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1557669,\"name\":\"Ryland\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The \\\"DJ\\\" Ryland story actually begins almost a decade ago in Littleton, Colo., the Denver suburb the Lynch siblings grew up in. Riker, the eldest Lynch, showed a knack for singing and performing early on and the other siblings followed suit. Thanks to a steady diet of Elvis, Beatles and Rolling Stones served up by their parents, and a healthy dose of sibling rivalry, the Lynch's started taking music seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We were always meant to be on stage together. When we were really little, we'd put on shows in the basement,\\\" remembers Rocky. \\\"Our mom would get on the phone and invite all our relatives to come over. We charged family members a dollar to watch us.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family moved to Los Angeles in 2007 to get their careers going in acting, dance, music and commercials.  Shortly after that, they formed the band R5, but Ryland, being a bit young, was destined for something else.  As R5 began touring, Ryland was busy working behind the scenes and soon became the bands lighting director. Shortly thereafter, he found his calling in the performance world as a DJ, opening for R5.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Ryland's high-energy show, combined with his infectious charisma, captivates audiences as he and the band travel extensively and bring their show to fans throughout the world.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-og.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":960},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/59/03-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.djryland.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/ryland.lynch\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/rylandR5\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"rylandR5\"},{\"id\":1711635,\"name\":\"Isac Elliot\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Coming soon!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-og.jpg\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":667},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/78/47-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kafF5qJHVcA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.isacelliot.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/IsacElliot\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/IsacElliot\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"IsacElliot\"},{\"id\":1753149,\"name\":\"Forever In Your Mind\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"FOREVER IN YOUR MIND\\r\\nLiam Attridge\\r\\nRicky Garcia\\r\\nEmery Kelly\\r\\n\\r\\nLiam Attridge, Ricky Garcia and Emery Kelly, the wildly talented teens who make up the \\\"forever\\\" part of Forever in Your Mind, will never forget it. During FIYM's recent Boston concert, they asked fans to take out their phones and turn on the flashlights. In an instant, 2,000 points of light illuminated the hall like a starry sky. \\\"It was so beautiful to see them respond like that,\\\" recalls Liam.\\r\\nThey'd better get used to it.\\r\\nWith the release of their self-titled debut Hollywood Records EP, FIYM is about to light up the pop music universe, thanks to their sophisticated artistry, high-kilowatt on-stage energy and positive message. \\\"We like to have fun with everything we do,\\\" notes Ricky. \\\"Being part of this band feels like I'm singing with my best friends.\\\"\\r\\nThe L.A.-based trio has had a big head start, having toured North America on the 2015 DigiTour alongside Demi Lovato. Fans know Ricky from his starring role on the Disney Channel Original Series \\\"Best Friends Whenever,\\\" and Emery from his co-starring roles on Disney Channel shows such as \\\"Dog With a Blog\\\" and \\\"Lab Rats.\\\"\\r\\nBut for all three members of FIYM, nothing runs deeper than a passion for creating music, as the new EP shows. Produced by Doug Rockwell and Khris Lorenz, the EP features four songs, three co-written by FIYM. The debut single \\\"Hurricane\\\" has already been gaining steam, with more than half-a-million YouTube views. \\\"It's just a fun, crazy song,\\\" says Liam, \\\"a metaphor for the euphoric emotions you feel when you're with that special person in your life.\\\"\\r\\nThe EP showcases FIYM's laser-like feel for vocal harmonies, as on the upbeat rocker \\\"Enough About Me.\\\" The ballad \\\"Compass\\\" reveals the guys' softer side. \\\"It's about losing the person closest to you,\\\" notes Liam, \\\"and then finding the compass that points them back to you.\\\" The EP wraps up with \\\"Whistle,\\\" a catchy pop gem that sums up the FIYM message: If you seriously want to have fun, give us a try.\\r\\n\\\"We put in so much work and dedication,\\\" says Emery. \\\"We're like three annoying brothers, but at the same time we tell ourselves that music and the love of our fans are what keep us going.\\\"\\r\\nThe FIYM story begins in Long Island, N.Y., where first cousins Liam and Emery both grew up. They started taking acting classes early on, and before they hit their teens both had co-starred in several local musical theater productions. \\\"As time progressed we learned to sing and act better,\\\" Emery recalls. \\\"I have the best memories of that time.\\\"\\r\\nIn 2013, on a whim, then-15-year-old Emery signed up for the hit TV talent show, \\\"X Factor.\\\" He passed the first audition and headed for Los Angeles. Luckily for him, while waiting to perform for Simon Cowell, he met fellow competitor, San Antonio native Ricky Garcia.\\r\\n\\\"I started pursuing music at 10,\\\" remembers Ricky, who grew up in a home filled with soul, R&B, hip-hop, country and pop music. \\\"My parents were supportive. They knew I liked to sing and act.\\\" How supportive? The Garcia family moved to Los Angeles in 2011 to get his career on track. Ricky entered several talent showcases, a strategy that paid off when he met artist manager Joby Harte, who connected Ricky with the Walt Disney Company.  Joby is FIYM's manager today.\\r\\nWhen Ricky and Emery met at \\\"X Factor\\\" they instantly became friends. Rather than compete as soloists, the two joined forces with a third hopeful to form a band, dubbed Forever In Your Mind by Simon Cowell. From there, the trio built a foundation, but in time it was clear a new third member was needed. That's when Emery called his cousin back east.\\r\\nBy then, Liam had become a veteran stage performer, a trained singer and an accomplished multi-instrumentalist, just what FIYM needed. \\\"When someone asks you to come to L.A. and do this, no 15-year-old would say no,\\\" Liam recalls. \\\"I bought a one-way ticket to Los Angeles, and I've never left.\\\"\\r\\nIn the two years since, FIYM has been on a roll, acting in hit Disney shows and creating a string of thrill-ride cover videos, such as their remakes of \\\"Cake By The Ocean,\\\" \\\"Shake Your Booty,\\\" and \\\"Night Changes.\\\" Over time, the band has matured as players, performers and songwriters. \\\"Songwriting is another way to increase our creative ability and express how we feel,\\\" Emery says. \\\"When I write with Liam and Ricky, we're like a triangle. We come together and shoot a beam to the sky.\\\"\\r\\nThe EP release is part of a broader plan. FIYM has a development deal with the Disney Channel for an original series starring the band, and this summer, Emery, Ricky and Liam will roam the countryside, performing live for fans and making new ones everywhere they go.\\r\\nThough they laugh about achieving \\\"world domination\\\" one day, Emery, Liam and Ricky are truly living day by day.
