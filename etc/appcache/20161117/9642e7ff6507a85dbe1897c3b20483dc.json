Birthed in a living room in the suburbs of Los Angeles in 2010, Branches spent their first year together making friends, playing shows, and writing and recording the songs for their EPs (\u201cO, Light!\u201d, \u201cCabin\u201d, \u201cSongs For Christmas\u201d) and their full-length (\u201cThou Art The Dream\u201d, released 2/12.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough both singalong celebration and solitary longing, their recordings provide the full spectrum of what this band is capable of: Indie-folk-rock-family-fun in a style that has been compared to the likes of Death Cab For Cutie, The Lumineers, Mumford and Sons, and The Head and The Heart. Pouring as much creativity and imagination into every live experience as they have into their studio recordings, they have been honored to sing in such notable California venues like the Hotel Cafe (Hollywood), The Independent (San Francisco), & the Glass House (Pomona), as well as touring nationally in the college circuit and enjoying their first venture into the crazy world of SXSW. Along the way, Branches has been honored to share the stage with such acts as MUTEMATH, Ivan and Alyosha, Twin Forks, Milo Greene, Charlie Peacock, Tyrone Wells, Family of The Year, and so many other wonderful friends and musicians.\\r\\n\\r\\nBranches has also seen great success in the world of television and trailer licensing, including spots on Cougar Town (TBS), One Tree Hill (CW), and The X Factor (FOX), among others. Branches was also recently listed as one of \u201c12 California Acts You Should Listen to Now\u201d by Paste Magazine.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, Branches are gearing up to enjoy another fun year of traveling, singing, and making friends in the wake of the release of their single, \\\"Darlin'\\\", also debuted on Paste Magazine. Under the watchful eye of Producer Andy Freeman (Eisley, Manchester Orchestra), this folk-pop-confessional came to life within the four walls of The Fortress (LA), and as Branches continue to take \\\"Darlin'\\\" beyond those four walls, this little love anthem is certain to leave an impression.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they\u2019re not on the road or in the studio, the band spends most of their time laughing at each other, frequenting local Mexican cuisine, and loving their lives. Join them for a night of singing and see for yourself what their music is all about.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":636},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-og.jpg\",\"width\":1500,\"height\":994},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":331},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":331},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":431},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/06/12/19-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":431}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://branchesmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/soundslikebranches\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/soundslikebranches\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/branchesmusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"branchesmusic\"},{\"id\":1767330,\"name\":\"Wesley Randolph Eader\",\"startTime\":\"2016-12-02 21:45:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"The Portland old-time inspired folk/country singer/songwriter Wesley Randolph Eader has family roots all over Tennessee, but he was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest.  Primarily a solo artist and storyteller, a true songwriters-songwriter, Eader's live performances are known to invoke both laughter and tears amongst the audiences who have had the opportunity to hear him play over the past few years.   He released his debut album \\\"Of Old It Was Recorded\\\" on Deeper Well Records in 2012.  This album proved that Eader had the voice and musical skill to fit within traditional American folk music, but more importantly it showed that he had the even rarer gift of crafting songs that sounded timeless, not just recycled. In true field recording style, Eader was discovered and approached by Eric Earley (Singer/Songwriter/Producer of Blitzen Trapper & Denver) and a couple weeks later they had a tracking session in Earley's apartment.  Those 10 debut songs could have easily been sung and recorded by country/bluegrass gospel legends such as Ralph Stanley,  Johnny Cash, Washington Phillips, or The Louvin Brothers.  Its not an uncommon story to hear the grandparents of young listeners mistaking Eader's music as old songs from their past, saying something like \\\"Hey! We used to sing that song when we were your age\\\".  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe four year period between \\\"Of Old It Was Recorded\\\" and Eader's new album \\\"Highway Winds\\\",which comes out August 23rd, were filled with ups and downs and everything in between.  Only days after releasing \\\"Of Old It Was Recorded\\\", Eader experienced the first of two spontaneous collapsed lungs, and a few grueling months of recovery that ultimately required emergency surgery. The near death experience and the mystery of whether or not the collapsed lungs were linked to years of playing trumpet as a kid, or too many nights of intense singing, caused Eader to contemplate the fragility of life and question the purpose of the musical gifts he had been given.   Despite the trials, he continued to maintain a presence around the Portland music scene, sharing stages and living rooms with all sorts of musicians; the highlights being a sold out show at the Aladdin Theatre in support of Josh Garrels, touring with Liz Vice on the Mcmenamin's Great Northwest Tour, and playing old-time standards and new tunes with Eric Earley at Al's Den.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Highway Winds\\\" represents a new arrival and a second wind for Eader.  The songs give a glimpse into Eader's wide range of classic songwriting influences, from the country ballads of Willie Nelson and Tom T. Hall, to the topical folksongs of Woody Guthrie and John Prine.  It was recorded entirely on tape and mastered straight to vinyl and features a host of Portland musicians including Eric Earley, Luke Price (National Old-time Fiddle Champion and member of Dean!), Danny O'Hanlon (Studio Engineer and Producer at Bungalow 9 Studios),  Rachel Dial (Singer/Guitarist for Mero and SS Bungalow) and more.  All these people have helped take Eader's songs, which stand strongly by themselves, to an even higher level of interest to the listener.  Nostalgic ridden Americana music lovers are sure to find \\\"Highway Winds\\\" a more than suitable soundtrack for the road.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":958,\"height\":958},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-og.jpg\",\"width\":958,\"height\":958},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/14/84-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"<iframe style=\\\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\\\" src=\\\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2452241444/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/\\\" seamless><a href=\\\"http://wesleyrandolpheader.bandcamp.com/album/highway-winds\\\">Highway Winds by Wesley Randolph Eader<\\/a><\\/iframe>\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://wesleyrandolpheader.bandcamp.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/wesleyrandolpheader\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":589423,\"name\":\"Hannah Glavor\",\"startTime\":\"2016-12-02 21:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"Hannah Glavor is a Portland based 6-piece indie folk masterpiece.
