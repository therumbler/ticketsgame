You Scientist\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"For the uninitiated, Thank You Scientist was forged from the music program at Montclair State University in New Jersey when guitarist Tom Monda met saxophonist Ellis Jasenovic and trumpeter Andrew Digrius. The three bonded over their love for Frank Zappa, Mahavishnu Orchestra, The Beatles and Harry Nilsson. Those influences would become the seeds for what Thank You Scientist would evolve into today.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the addition of vocalist Salvatore Marrano, bassist Greg Colacino, drummer Odin Alvarez and violinist Ben Karas, Thank You Scientist's lineup of virtuoso musicians was complete. The band would go on to self-release an EP, The Perils of Time Travel, in 2011 followed by their debut full-length, Maps of Non-Existent Places, in 2012, which caught the ear of Sanchez, a fellow purveyor of progressive stylings, and led to his signing of the band.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo pinpoint Thank You Scientist's sound would be inconceivable. On Maps of Non-Existent Places they hold a virtual master class on musicianship, fusing elements of progressive rock with jazz fusion, classical, metal, psychedelic and pop for a head spinning, mind-blowing listening experience. The seven-piece band, who collectively play some 20 instruments, boasts a hyper-composed sound which is indebted to their experience and formal training in both classical and jazz idioms.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Frank Zappa for the indie generation? Incubus jamming with the Mahavishnu Orchestra? Mr. Bungle and Steely Dan joining forces to fight Godzilla? King Crimson and the Brecker Brothers serenading you at your bedside? It all seems so strange on paper, yet it's sure to satisfy your ears in the best of ways.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-og.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":640},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":640},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/08/13-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thankyouscientist.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/tyscientist\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/ThankYouScientist/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/thankyouscientist\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"thankyouscientist\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1676571,\"name\":\"Moon Tooth\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"February 5th, 2016 marked the release of Chromaparagon, the debut full-length album by Long Island, New York band Moon Tooth.\\n\\nStream or purchase the album, here:\\nhttp://moontoothny.bandcamp.com/\\n\\nA fireworks display of melody and rhythm, Chromaparagon is more than that too \u2013 its progressive, aggressive sound is brimming with soul, riddled with hairpin turns, and delivered with the grace and swing of real virtuosos. Over the course of twelve songs, Moon Tooth mashes together rock, metal, and blues, into a fusion that bursts with color. There are few limits here. Moon Tooth possesses the imagination and skill to swerve into whatever musical direction it wants. But this band wanders without getting lost; it channels its wild dreaming and black-belt chops into an album that drives forward with purpose. \\n\\nFrontman John Carbone carries forth the tradition of singers with the range and the courage to go for it. Like Jeff Buckley, Into Another's Richie Birkenhead or Shudder to Think's Craig Wedren, Carbone belts it out with a soaring voice that can command quiet subtlety as well as arena-rocking operatics. In poetic, modern-mythic phrases, his lyrics address themes of, in his own words, \\\"trials, perseverance, victory... answering the call of adventure, following what you know to be your true purpose even in the face of danger, uncertainty and fear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I made love to my ordeals / By light of holy fire / A lion rearing under ash / All the beasts of un-days loomed / And I saw Mars stand,\\\" Carbone sings on the song \\\"Igneous.\\\"\\n\\nGuitarist Nick Lee (also the newest member of veteran heavy metal act Riot, now known as Riot V) extracts entire worlds out of his instrument. His dexterity is matched only by his soulfulness. Backing him are bassist Vincent Romanelli and drummer Ray Marte who glide swiftly from tasty grooves and rhythmic illusions to full-on metal muscularity.\\n\\nLoosely speaking, some modern-day reference points include The Mars Volta, Mastodon, and Between The Buried And Me. But Moon Tooth is its own, unique, \\\"undeniably strange, totally kick-ass beast\\\" as one MetalSucks editor put it.\\n\\nChromaparagon was recorded, mixed, and mastered by Moon Tooth drummer Ray Marte. The vivid cover art was created by Jon Contino. It is preceded by the band's 2013 debut EP, Freaks. \\n\\nMoon Tooth has shared stages with Killswitch Engage, The Dillinger Escape Plan, GWAR, Mutoid Man, Candiria, Weedeater, Veil of Maya, KEN Mode, Cancer Bats, King Parrot, and more.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://moontoothny.bandcamp.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/moontoothband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/moontooth1\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"moontooth1\"},{\"id\":1739795,\"name\":\"The Tea Club\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The Tea Club is a band from New Jersey consisting of Patrick McGowan (vocals/guitar/keyboards), Dan McGowan (vocals/guitar/keyboards),  Jamie Wolff (bass/violin/cello), Joe Dorsey (keyboards) and Dan Monda (drums).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, the band was discovered by producer Tim Gilles (Anthrax, Taking Back Sunday, Hades, Bear vs. Shark, Thursday), who recorded, produced, and mixed their first album at Big Blue Meenie Studios. \u201cGeneral Winter\u2019s Secret Museum\u201d was released in July 2008. The album included original artwork by Dan and Patrick McGowan, with an album cover by artist Kendra DeSimone.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a brief East Coast tour, The Tea Club returned to Tim Gilles and Big Blue Meenie Studios to record their second album entitled \u201cRabbit\u201c which was released on October 9th 2010. The album featured guest keyboardist Tom Brislin (Yes, Renaissance, OK Go, Meatloaf, Camel).\\r\\n\\r\\nLike General Winter\u2019s Secret Museum, the album cover was painted by Kendra DeSimone and featured original artwork by Dan and Patrick McGowan. Rabbit was met with very positive reviews. The Organ \u2018zine praised The Tea Club for being a band that is \u201dnot afraid to nail their colours firmly to their mast and fly directly in to the face of fashion\u201d. Indie Music Reviewer said that Rabbit \u201dcan appease any listener of just about any genre\u201d, giving the album 5 out of 5 stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey spent the rest of 2010 and 2011 touring the East Coast, including performances at the ProgDay Music Festival in North Carolina, the Philly Film & Music Festival, and the NJ Proghouse Music Series. Reviews and articles about the band were featured in publications such as Metro Philly, Indie Music Reviewer, Origivation, and JUMP. The band also released several homemade music videos for songs from the Rabbit album. They ended 2011 by opening for Jimmy Gnecco of the band Ours in Philadelphia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2012, The Tea Club once again returned to Big Blue Meenie Studios to record their third album with producer Tim Gilles. Following these sessions, the band was invited to support Beardfish on their mini-tour of the United States in May 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tea Club\u2019s third album, \u201cQuickly Quickly Quickly\u201d, was released on November 15th, 2012. Once again, the album cover was done by Kendra DeSimone with artwork by the McGowan brothers. Quickly Quickly Quickly was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews and made several \u201cTop Albums of 2012\u201d lists. Dangerdog Music Reviews called the album \u201cwildly inventive\u201d, while Instrumentali.com said that \u201cThe Tea Club has taken the dormant rock beast and tied a choke chain onto it.\u201d Conor Fynes of The Metal Observer had this to say in his review of Quickly Quickly Quickly: \u201cAlthough 2012 was a year host to output of impressive records from some of progressive rock\u2019s finest, The Tea Club just may have topped them all.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, The Tea Club travelled to Canada to perform two 90 minute sets at the Terra Incognita Festival in Quebec City. In August 2013, the band toured the United States with Thank You Scientist. The tour included a performance at Indie Music Reviewer\u2019s IMR Music Festival 2013 in Atlanta, GA.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tea Club spent 2014 writing and recording at Big Blue Meenie Studios. These recordings became The Tea Club\u2019s fourth album, \u201cGrappling\u201d, which was released on November 17, 2015. Grappling was met with critical acclaim, with many reviewers calling it the band\u2019s greatest achievement, solidifying the band as a major presence in progressive rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tea Club will be opening for the band HAKEN in September on part of their \u201cAffinity\u201d Tour of the USA. The Tea Club also announced the upcoming release of the Grappling Graphic Novel, a 6-issue comic book series that elaborates on the stories told in the lyrics of their Grappling album. Written by Patrick McGowan with artwork by Dan McGowan and Kendra DeSimone, the first issue will be available October 10th, 2016.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":597,\"height\":427},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":597,\"height\":427},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":215},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":143},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-og.jpg\",\"width\":597,\"height\":427},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":72},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":358},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":597,\"height\":427},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/62/27-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":597,\"height\":427}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.theteaclub.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/theteaclubband/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/the_tea_club\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"the_tea_club\"},{\"id\":1774104,\"name\":\"Megosh\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Forged from the bone-metal of ancient dragons, Megosh rises, and the gods tremble...\\n\\nBaltimore's Megosh has been toiling behind the scenes for some time brewing up a catalog of high-energy intelligent rock.
