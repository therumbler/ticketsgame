Its a sound which traces back to the origins of blues, when a single guitarist rocked the house all night long. When these ancient droning patterns consisting of bass, rhythm, and lead syncopated together are plugged into modern sound systems and teamed up with driving drum beats, Malcolms guitar becomes larger than life, bringin state of the art primal Mississippi Juke Joint Blues to the big stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sound didn't just come out of nowhere. Born in Missouri in mid 70s, Malcolm started playing his music and traveling on the road in his late teens. He lived his music, playing night and day where ever the road took him, surviving off his versatility. \\\"Music had been on my mind since 6 or 7, but it took till my teen years to start gettin around on my own, and you know, put it into action. I played mostly solo then, playin guitar,singing, and kick and snare drums with my feet as a 1 man band.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis travels took him all over but it was North Mississippi that he identified with most and took him in. He immediately befriended and began performing with many of the Legends living there such as Big Jack Johnson, Cedell Davis, R.L. Burnside, Hubert Sumlin, Honeyboy Edwards, T Model Ford, Sam Carr, Jessie Mae Hemphill, Otha Turner, Robert Belfour and many others. Over thousands of nights playing the rough and tumble juke joints, soaking up the rhythms and culture, Malcolm learned to be an alert and durable performer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I used to show up at juke joints solo, and they would be listenin' to the jukebox and everybody dancin' to Al Green, Johnnie Taylor, and Tyrone Davis. Then they would shut the jukebox off and stick me out in the middle of the floor\u2026and man I'd be so nervous cuz the jukebox sounded so good and I didn't think they would accept or want to hear me\u2026 But this was how I was surviving and failure was not an option\u2026 You had to win them over on the first song or you wasn't gonna get another try! Guitar solos weren't important but basslines and rhythm was mandatory for the dancers, and you had to sing with everything you got! And once you won them over you was bout to have the greatest night of your life!!\\r\\nFresh off the road Lightnin' Malcolm forges ahead with his new album \\\"Renegade.\\\" The album is due out on April 12 on Ruf Records. \\\"Renegade\\\" is high energy, hill country blues fused with modern elements of funk, reggae, soul, and rock. It features 13 new original songs all written and produced by Lightnin' Malcolm. \\r\\n\\r\\nRecorded in Clarksdale, MS \\\"Renegade\\\" is a guitar and drums duo recording, played live and raw in the North Mississippi hill country tradition. Joining Lightnin' on drums is Cameron Kimbrough, grandson of blues legend Jr. Kimbrough. Cameron's creative energy, versatile playing, combined with his natural family talent creates a perfect fit for Malcolm's hypnotic grooves. Renegade also features a horn section on a few tracks comprised of Jim Spake, David McKnight, and Nahshon Benford. Lightnin' befriended the trio while touring with the popular Americana act Lucero. Nadirah Shakoor (Jimmy Buffet) lends her beautiful voice on the reggae flavored \\\"Precious Jewel.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA Renegade by definition is an individual who rejects lawful or conventional behavior. The concept of Renegade closely reflects the turbulent lifestyle of a traveling musician. The authenticity of the music certainly permeates as a result on this album.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\" The songs on this album are definitely the result of years livin' the renegade lifestyle. The renegade cuts against the grain, doin' things his own way on his own terms. I've always tried to be a right doin' person, to help people around me...I follow the laws of the universe, not the laws of man...I know right from wrong. Most times your on your own, movin' from place to place with your guitar and your music..\\\"at the same time interacting, entertaining, jamming, working, helping, teaching, learning, singing, dancing, sleeping, and living with all the people that come through your life. You are what you've done and the legacy you leave behind is the life you live everyday. Its all about the music and the only way to play it is to live it,\\\" says Lightnin' Malcolm. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe music unites musicians and audience as they interact in a hypnotic dance with everybody rejoicing to the power and joy of the music we call the Blues!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1441},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-og.jpg\",\"width\":1066,\"height\":1600},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":976},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/85/88/93-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.lightninmalcolm.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lightnin-Malcolm/142957862420209\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1394271,\"name\":\"RL Boyce\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"RL Boyce is a blues musician from Como, Mississippi.
