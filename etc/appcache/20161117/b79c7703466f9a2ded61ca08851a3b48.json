Recorded with French house DJ/producer Martin Solveig. And somehow found a newer, younger audience and become more prolific as the years transpire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIn a curious case of musical evolution, the older Fields becomes, the closer he gets to perfecting the sound of soul that he grew up with as a young man,\u201d noted NPR music writer Oliver Wang (and that was back in 2009).. Now Fields returns with his most triumphant and honest record yet, Special Night, recorded with The Expressions and released on Brooklyn\u2019s Big Crown Records.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial Night follows the the critical success of his Truth & Soul recordings My World, Faithful Man and 2014\u2019s Emma Jean \u2014 the last one American Songwriter hailing as \u201cmore than just a stroll down memory lane \u2026 it\u2019s the sound of a man who understands his musical strengths and plays to them with class, authority and soul searching intensity.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nYou\u2019ll hear Fields flexing those strengths on Special Night. There\u2019s some JB-style funk on there. And hints of Stax, Chess, Fame and Motown.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this is not a throwback. Possessing a voice that\u2019s equally raucous and tender, Fields crafts a truly honest, soulful work. \u201cThis is a record about what people do in real life,\u201d says the singer. For one example, he cites the yearning \u201cWork to Do,\u201d which entails a \u201ca guy going to counseling, drinking too much, apologizing to the old lady and trying to keep family together, doing the manly thing.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAdds Fields: \u201cWhen I record, I make every song like I actually mean it. I mean every word I say. On Special Night I\u2019m talking to my lady \u2014 literally, expressing the way I feel. You can tell if a song is real or not. And every moment I\u2019m recording, those moments are real.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, album standout \u201cMake This World\u201d works both as militaristic funk and a cautionary tale about the health of the planet. \u201cThe world was designed to last indefinitely,\u201d says Fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re the only living species on Earth who can alter that process. I\u2019m hoping that song has a chain reaction, helps somebody put into action whatever contribution they can to change what the world is going through.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFields and his six-piece band will tour in the fall, where he notes the audiences seem tgrowing and changing. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a younger crowd,\u201d he notes. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for his late success? Fields regrets nothing. \u201cI was already talking to myself in the beginning of my career about the end of my career,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a little naive, so I told myself, \u2018Think about the future in every song you make. Make things you can live with. Everything you do has consequences.\u2019 And today, I live like I\u2019ve always lived.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nA credo that continues with Special Night. \u201cAll the songs on that record have special meaning,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope people take a good listen to it and find the magic.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/53/55-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"//www.youtube.com/embed/AhMJKkeVVVA\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.truthandsoulrecords.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/leefieldsandtheexpressions\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/LeeFields12\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"LeeFields12\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1769511,\"name\":\"Lady Wray\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Virginia-born singer/songwriter Nicole Wray has everything you\u2019d want in a singer: an infectious Jackson-5-family-member flare, a range like Aretha\u2019s, and a church upbringing that\u2019s brought a pure, healing texture to her voice. But the struggle she\u2019s been through has made her more than a singer. Nicole Wray is an artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen talking about Queen Alone, her first solo album in some time, Nicole explains, \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of my soul. It\u2019s who I am today.\u201d And aptly so. Released on Brooklyn\u2019s Big Crown Records, Nicole is writing and singing songs about her life. And yet to even start to know her soul, you have to go back to the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing up in Portsmouth was tough at times for Nicole. Of course, there were aspects of teenage normalcy: the Sundays in church, hanging out with friends, her first real job as a temporary telemarketer. At the age of fifteen, life opened up quickly when Missy Elliot paid a visit to Nicole\u2019s family home to audition her on the spot. Missy was there on the rumored strength and quality of her voice. Instantly blowing her away, she signed and left with Missy that night. Two years later, in 1998, she had a hit gold single off a solid debut album (Make It Hot). Suddenly she was part of a team that included late \u201890s R&B and rap royalty: Missy, Aaliyah, Ginuwine, Playa, Timbaland and Magoo. She made it. And fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the only hint of a second album was a single (\u201cI\u2019m Lookin\u2019\u201d). As rapidly as she achieved success, Nicole then found herself needing to re-make it. By late 2001, her time with Missy and company had run its course. They amicably parted ways and Nicole, once on top of the R&B world, was unsure of what was next.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very low, but important, point in her life. While her passion and talent propelled her forward\u2013friends disappeared and her purpose seemed unclear. While neck-deep in this struggle, Damon Dash and Roc-A-Fella Records called. They signed an album deal and by 2004 she had a new single that was getting healthy play (\u201cIf I Was Your Girlfriend\u201d). In what was starting to be a pattern, just as things were looking up, Roc-A-Fella then (famously) split and despite the strong single, there wasn\u2019t enough push to get her sophomore album out. Once again, industry factors beyond her control took charge. Like a recurring dream, Nicole found herself in a familiar situation. Having just been in the spotlight, and then again back living the \u201creal life.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the fickleness of the industry, life was also testing her. Nicole\u2019s father and his drug addiction strained her parents\u2019 marriage, family members had run-ins with the law, and friends passed away too early. Motivated by the pain, she pushed on, and through this duality of regular life and fame, Nicole came into her own. No longer that shy girl from Virginia, letting people write her lyrics and dictate how she sang songs\u2013Nicole was more in control of what she wanted and was a smarter and sharper vocalist for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaintaining her connection with Damon Dash, she did a few guest spots. Nicole\u2019s powerful voice had a huge presence on The Black Keys\u2019 Blackroc project in 2009 which led her to recording background vocals on The Black Keys\u2019 Grammy-winning LP, Brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, Nicole paired up with London vocalist Terri Walker and released the album Lady. On Truth & Soul Records, Nicole and Terri had a backdrop supplied by the same musicians that helped make Aloe Blacc a global smash and Lee Fields a household name. Pitchfork said of the LP: \u201cThe singers clearly relish the opportunity to indulge in a little comfort food soul, resulting in an infectiously fun set with broad, cross-generational appeal.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, Nicole was tested. Terri parted ways with the group to pursue her own projects shortly after the album\u2019s release\u2013despite rave reviews and upcoming travel dates. Nicole could\u2019ve stopped as well. Instead, she carried the Lady project herself, show to show, town to town. In the face of frustration and decisions beyond her control, Nicole stepped up and took charge. She knew that she could make this happen. The Lady project allowed Nicole to showcase her impeccably strong and unique voice as well as her succinct poetic prowess for song writing. She found herself renewed and in a realer place, a place where success and frustration honed her talent and drive. She wasn\u2019t just a singer anymore\u2014she was tapping into something altogether different.\\r\\n\\r\\nFast forward to now\u2013the transformation from singer-for-hire to pure artist is evident in this new full-length solo release, Queen Alone. Reunited with the top-class musicianship from the Lady project and with Big Crown\u2019s own Leon Michels and Daptone / Dunham\u2019s Tom Brenneck handling production, Nicole says she is \u201cSinging out loud now\u2013singing from the stomach.\u201d Back in 1998 she was coached how to sing. Today, after stutter-stepping in and out of the industry, there is a new soul and substance to her songs\u2013all of it from her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost echoing her new record, Nicole says, \u201cYou have to go through something for it to be real.\u201d She has been living with one foot in fame and the other in real life. The result is clear: she\u2019s feeling something real in her music again. And it\u2019s hard for us as listeners not to follow suit.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1464},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":457},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":305},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-og.jpg\",\"width\":1343,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":152},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":762},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":991},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/52/93-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"enewW8iZr-s\",\"title\":\"Lady Wray - Do It Again\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/enewW8iZr-s\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/enewW8iZr-s\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Ladynicolewray/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Ladynicolewray\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Ladynicolewray\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.aladdin-theater.com/event/1331643?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
