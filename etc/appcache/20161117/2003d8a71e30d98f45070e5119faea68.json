Robison\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"AUSTIN, TX--Imagine you are Texas singer-songwriter Bruce Robison on any given Saturday night, and you might be forgiven for thinking life looks pretty good. You\u2019re on your way to headline at one of the Texas Hill Country\u2019s legendary dancehalls\u2014the Broken Spoke, say, or Gruene Hall or Floore\u2019s Country Store\u2014when one of your songs comes on the radio. Maybe it\u2019s Tim McGraw and Faith Hill\u2019s hit version of \u201cAngry All the Time,\u201d or George Strait\u2019s cover of \u201cWrapped\u201d or even the Dixie Chicks\u2019 No. 1 hit, \u201cTravelin\u2019 Soldier.\u201d It\u2019s a pleasant interlude in what Dan Jenkins used to call \u201cLife Its Ownself.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs one of the most acclaimed tunesmiths to come out of Austin, Bruce has worked in the traditional musical model all his life: Sign with a label; Record an album; release single; tour to support same\u2026and repeat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut although his songwriting work ethic remains anchored to traditional values\u2014strong storylines, compelling characters, hook-laden melodies\u2014Robison is working hard to refit his business model to reflect new music industry realities.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor one thing, although he has an album\u2019s worth of new songs (From the Top, produced by Rodney Crowell, for his own Premium Records label) ready to go, Robison is committed to recording and releasing a song or two at a time, as opposed to entire albums. By releasing singles directly to radio in chosen markets, and making them available online, he can use exposure to cultivate interest in his personal appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this is written, Bruce is giving away free \u201cSong of the Month\u201d downloads, via his website (www.brucerobison.com) and his Facebook page. By using radio, the web and old-fashioned, boots-on-the-ground live shows, Robison wants to make it easy for fans to find his music without having to rely on the vagaries of traditional promotion outlets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cMy feeling is now, that everybody\u2019s on their own,\u201d he says of the current state of the industry. \u201cThere\u2019s no labels, there\u2019s hardly any management. It\u2019s like the Fifties again; we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s all going to shake out. But I\u2019m really excited about the future, and finding new ways to get the music directly to the fans. And I\u2019m having fun doing it.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nIn a similar spirit, he\u2019s taken pains to revitalize his live sound. He has recruited Joey Sheffield from the Austin pop-rock band Fastball (their 1998 song, \u201cThe Way\u201d was a massive radio hit) and Brian Becken and Bruce Hughes from the acoustic-music ensemble the South Austin Jug Band. In blending strains of acoustic roots music with pop melodicism and his own incisive sense of songcraft, Robison is injecting a new vigor and energy into his live shows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m the luckiest guy that I know, you know?\u201d Bruce says rhetorically. \u201cI just want to have a great time onstage, and I hope that comes across.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe best part of the whole deal is we\u2019re really good friends and we were friends before we ever started collaborating, so that adds a nice foundation to the whole thing.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, there are traditional avenues that Robison still pursues avidly. A working songwriter, he still goes to Nashville regularly to write songs and keep his hand in the mainstream country music market. But with a new band and a new blueprint for getting his music into folks\u2019 hands and heads, Robison is not only confronting change, he is embracing it. \\r\\n\\r\\nRobison has hit the musical trifecta as a songwriter, performer and go-to guy for hits. Though it is as a songwriter that Robison has always defined himself, it\u2019s as a performer that he feels most alive. \\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s almost like foreplay and the other thing,\u201d he says with a laugh, delineating the difference. \u201cFor me, writing a song--you might think that it\u2019s good, and you record it.\u201d But, he adds, there\u2019s nothing like seeing the music take on a life of its own onstage in front of an audience. \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest guy that I know, you know? I just want to have a great time onstage, and I hope that comes across.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough he is about as far from a preening egotist as it is possible for an artist to be, Bruce Robison takes a fierce, unvarnished pride in what he has achieved in the field of songcraft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I always had very high goals and a very high opinion of myself as a songwriter,\\\" he said, adding, \\\"and I don't say that in a conceited way. I just think everybody should feel good about what they do. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"And I really loved calling myself a songwriter, from the time I first started doing it through the first ten years, when I never made a dime.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hit versions of Robison compositions by Strait, McGraw and Hill, the Dixie Chicks, Lee Ann Womack and Allison Moorer helped change all that. \\\"I've never not liked it anytime anybody's cut one of my songs. I'll always be amazed by that,\\\" he marvels.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing in the footsteps of Texas icons Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker, Bruce has remained fiercely independent by making a base for himself in Austin. With his own recording studio, record label and fan base that fills a dance floor whenever he plays - the Lone Star State is home. Always will be.\\r\\nAnd that telekinetic thrust is what makes Cheater's Game, a collection of songs that hurt, cheat, doubt, lust and hold on, so very delicious. Whether it's the busted samba refiguring of Dave Alvin's \\\"Border Radio\\\" that turns up the woman's reality from the Blasters' original, Don Williams' truth in what's really going on \\\"We're All The Way\\\" or the Beatles-esque shuffling pluck of sweeping close harmonies on Robison's own \\\"But I Do,\\\" there's complexity in the neon and the heartbreak, as much said in the tone these notes are sung with as the actual lyrics or what the instrumental breaks evoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It was a lot of things,\\\" Robison says. \\\"Crazy, sexy, cool, terrifying\u2026We both know how to make records, have takes on how this works\u2026But together that all goes out the window. This is bringing in 30 songs and sitting with her, then Kelly just sings'em\u2026 Some work, some don't\u2026 and some, well, something just happens! Those are the ones we keep.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all their differences musically\u2014Willlis explains, \\\"I'm more rockabilly/60s, and he's got that '70s Texas songwriter thing\\\"\u2014they're both artists deeply rooted in the hard country, yet deeply progressive music scene that's Texas post-Bob Wills. A place long on big emotions, serious Saturday nights, long necks, roadhouses, big hair, roughnecks and tender hearted women, Texas' Robison and Willis bridge the gaps and build a refuge for the Venus/Mars continuum that is men and women high on hormones and short on guilt, not to mention the craggy aftermath of same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also follow in the tradition of couples making kinetic music of all stripes. Not just Johnny and June and Tammy and George, Waylon and Jesse or even Conway and Loretta, but also X's roots-steeped punks John Doe and Exene Cervenka. That merging of songs and life, knowing and dreaming adds depth and frenzy to the music.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'd never suggest we were in any of their leagues,\\\" Willis says. \\\"But seeing them, I do feel a kinship. Making music with that person you're closest to in the world, who understands what this is\u2026 Bruce and I have been together since 1991, and a lot has happened to us over all that time. It's a lot just being in show business. Then you're a couple and trying to do that. Of course there's friction and disappointment along the way. But it makes everything more, and better.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can hear the palpable joy on heartbreakers like Dickie Lee's classic \\\"9,999,999,\\\" as well as Robison's sultry stakes are high \\\"Cheater's Game\\\" and the languidly romantic \\\"Waterfall,\\\" with Willis' red velvet voice angsting for the missing lover intertwined with Robison's basic blond wood declarations. The chemistry between the pair ignites these songs, giving them a third dimension that makes 1+1 something closer to 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe it's because even if on only a metaphysical plane they've lived many of these emotions, if not moments. From the awkward engagement of Robert Earl Keen's \\\"No Kinda Dancer\\\" to the aw shucks gobsmackedness of \\\"Ordinary Fool,\\\" there is a good bit of the early days of Bruce'n'Kelly in here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's a transformative thing that passes between them. Listening to Hayes Carll's regret-filled \\\"Long Way Home,\\\" the ballad takes on a sense of gentle compassion for the lost soul, a desire for some kind of deliverance beyond the knowledge that they're gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Sadness, happiness or tension, but it's really all about the tension,\\\" Robison admits. \\\"I think whatever's there is amplified by the harmony, what's between the notes as much as the notes: the way they bend and twist.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Beyond the harmony, there is something that happens when it works,\\\" Willis picks up. \\\"You can't explain it, but you know\u2026 Look at 'Lifeline,' with its fabulous melody and the chorus with those harmonies. That is so much more. Maybe it's that I'm such a fan of Bruce and his writing, or maybe it's just loving him so much and having that, knowing he's there makes the song better! They make it more because they understand.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEnlisting producer Brad Jones also helped. The man who's worked with Over The Rhine, Josh Rouse, Hayes Carll and Jill Sobule provided an outside perspective that allowed objectivity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"He works from a different world than us,\\\" Willis explains. \\\"Though he's done some artists from this world, too\u2026He drew out some different things from us, things we wouldn't have seen.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt runs right through the project, right through to the Everly-esque \\\"Dreamin',\\\" which Robison wrote with Fastball's Miles Zuniga. What starts as a hushed heartbreak for a summer love turns into a classic country lope of regret that's built for Wurlitzer jukeboxes and those last moments of what was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We really wanted a sound that was unique to our little combo,\\\" Willis says. \\\"Something quiet and not what you'd expect, something no one else would do. We went on the road all summer as a quartet\u2026with a stand up bass and Bruce not playing electric guitar\u2026and in all that we found this.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, as Robison cautions, \\\"The last thing we want to do is be a boring old married couple! Because the happy suburban married couple is not what this is\u2026We spent a year going through songs, sending them off to Brad, and getting his feedback. This is very old school, but we try to approach it from the left flank: a little quirky, a little old and obviously very much what Kelly does so well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Getting to go onstage with her is like getting up there with a smart bomb. I know whatever happens, she's going to be amazing\u2026the songs are going to shine\u2026and we're all going to have a whole lot of fun, even if we are singing a bunch of really sad songs.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That's true,\\\" Willis agrees. \\\"We really connected with these songs, and went places neither of is would have been before. This is so much more carefree and fun for, being part of a band, getting to do this with Bruce. There's a real trust when we're on that stage, and it gives me this sense of joy. You can hear that, and that's one thing you can't fake.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFaking it is for old married couples, something both Robison and Willis have already disallowed. Making music together seems to make them both fresher, freer and more inspired.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":850,\"height\":315},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":850,\"height\":315},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":111},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":111},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":74},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":74},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-og.jpg\",\"width\":850,\"height\":315},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":37},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":37},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":185},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":185},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":241},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/12/66-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":241}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"Fm3i6M1HHbw\",\"title\":\"Bruce Robison   Angry All The Time\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fm3i6M1HHbw\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fm3i6M1HHbw\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://bruceandkellyshow.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/brucerobisonmusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/brucerobison\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"brucerobison\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.theliveoak.com/event/1379193?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
