Heathens\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"In the course of evolving from loose assemblage to world-class rock 'n' roll outfit, the Band of Heathens has built a potent body of recorded work that's won the Austin, Texas ensemble a fiercely loyal fan base and a reputation as one of its hometown's most vital musical resources. BoH is also known as one of America's hardest-working touring acts, while revealing a musical and lyrical depth that consistently enriches an infectious songcraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nSunday Morning Record, the Band of Heathens' fourth studio album (and seventh overall), marks a milestone in the resilient outfit's development, capturing the musicians' remarkable creative chemistry along with the deepening melodic and emotional resonance in the songwriting of founding singer-guitarists Ed Jurdi and Gordy Quist. The 11-song set, produced by Austin studio vets and longtime BoH collaborators George Reiff and Steve Christensen, is the product of an intense period\\r\\nof change within and around the group.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Sunday Morning Record was born in the midst of change,\\\" agrees Quist. \\\"Life changes, lineup changes, geographic changes. It was a rollercoaster of a year, but that change served the album well and became our muse.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We set out to make a record that chronicled the journey of the band through a really difficult and uncertain time,\\\" Jurdi states. \\\"In the midst of all of this, Gordy and I were writing songs, starting families, moving families and trying to find a thread to hold onto with our music.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musicians' journey is documented with insight, humor and empathy on such compelling new tunes as \\\"Shotgun,\\\" \\\"Caroline Williams,\\\" \\\"Miss My Life,\\\" \\\"Girl With Indigo Eyes\\\" and \\\"Records in Bed,\\\" which embody the catchy tunes and punchy performances for which BoH is known, while showcasing the subtlety and\\r\\nintrospection that have become increasingly prominent in the band's work, with an added emphasis on the acoustic textures that have long been present in its arsenal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I really think that this is the most personal group of songs we've ever released,\\\" asserts Quist. \\\"We had over 30 to choose from, and they were written while we were pondering some major life changes and digging to find the essence of what the band is.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSunday Morning Record \u2014 released, like all but one of its prior albums, on the band's own BOH Records label \u2014 also benefits from the powerful rapport between founding members Jurdi and Quist, longtime keyboardist Trevor Nealon, and the most recent addition to the band, Richard Millsap on drums.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We closed the circle smaller around us,\\\" Jurdi notes. \\\"We worked at George Reiff's house and kept the vibe as relaxed as possible. We worked fast, cutting a song a day. We worked in the moment, creating songs during the session, changing others, and eliminating the ones that didn't fit.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe qualities that make Sunday Morning Record so compelling have been built into the Band of Heathens from its origins in 2005. It was then that Jurdi, Quist and Colin Brooks \u2014 all of whom had already issued solo albums and were working separately as singer-songwriters around Austin \u2014 joined forces after informally sitting in on one another's sets at the now-defunct West 6th Street club Momo's. The like-minded tunesmiths soon forged a long-term collaboration, and the aggregation became a full-fledged rock 'n' roll band.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Band of Heathens' imposing reputation as a live act was reflected in their decision to launch their recording career with a pair of live albums, 2006's Live From Momo's and 2007's CD/DVD Live at Antone's. 2008 saw the release of an eponymous\\r\\nfirst studio effort, produced by iconic Texas troubadour Ray Wylie Hubbard. That album won widespread fan approval and copious critical acclaim, as did 2009's One Foot in the Ether, which, like its predecessor, reached the #1 slot on the national Americana charts. Also in 2009, the band gained substantial TV exposure,\\r\\nperforming live sets on PBS' Austin City Limits and the legendary German music show Rockpalast, as well as being honored as Best New Band at the Austin Music Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the Band of Heathens' third studio album, Top Hat Crown and the Clapmaster's Son, became the group's most expansive and adventurous statement to date, expanding its sound with a dose of psychedelic sensibility. That effort was followed by the two-CD/two-DVD set The Double Down: Live in Denver, which once\\r\\nagain spotlighted the band's mastery as a live unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in 2011, the Band of Heathens experienced its first major personnel shakeup, with Brooks deciding to move on to new projects, and founding member/bassist Seth Whitney and drummer John Chipman soon exiting as well. Jurdi and Quist reorganized with keyboardist Trevor Nealon, a longtime friend of Gordy's who had joined in 2009, and new drummer Richard Millsap, who had been recommended by his predecessor Chipman, along with a revolving assortment of bassists. The retooled lineup proved its mettle through some diligent road-testing before getting to work on\\r\\nSunday Morning Record.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, other changes were afoot, with Gordy and his wife preparing for the birth of their first child, while Ed was in the process of relocating his family to Asheville, N.C. The longtime bandmates both agree that the finished results on Sunday Morning Record justify the extra effort that went into the album's creation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This record's a bit on the quieter side dynamically, but I feel like it's sharper around the corners, both lyrically and musically,\\\" adds Jurdi. \\\"I think people see us as a rock 'n' roll band, which we are. But for us, a lot of the best stuff we've done is our quieter stuff, and we did more of that on this record. The further into life you get, the more you realize that life isn't black and white, and that there are millions of shades of grey in between. And as we become better songwriters and better musicians, I think we're better able to explore those grey areas a little more.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSunday Morning Record's more intimate focus is also reflected in the album's title, which was inspired by a line in \\\"Records in Bed\\\" and nods to the value of escaping from the noise of everyday life in order to absorb music, art and life in a more\\r\\npersonal and immediate way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It seems like it's gotten harder and harder for people to turn off the constant stream of information and distractions and just lose themselves in art for a little while,\\\" says Quist. \\\"Now we're connected to everything in the world at all times, and maybe that makes our lives richer in some ways. But I think that there's also a\\r\\nrichness that we miss out on, of just being present in the now and experiencing the world directly. I hope this album moves people to turn off the noise of life for a morning to connect with themselves and with some friends through our music.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm interested to see how these songs are received when we take them out on the road, because I think that they may make people think differently about the band,\\\" Jurdi concludes. \\\"In all of the chaos surrounding us, music has been a refuge from all of the madness. We chronicled our trip through a strange, weird and intense time. You can hear it all here: the joy, the heartache, the disappointment, the longing and ultimately the resolution that this band has found to continue to make albums and perform shows together.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":730},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":228},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":152},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1558},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":76},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":380},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":494},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/30/45/03-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.bandofheathens.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/thebandofheathens\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/thebandofheathens\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/BandofHeathens\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"BandofHeathens\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1371369,\"name\":\"The Statesboro Revue\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\\\"The Statesboro Revue is in the process of re-defining rock and roll, refusing to let blues and country, the real roots of rock music, fall by the wayside. Stewart and the Statesboro Revue are trying to remind America what rock music is really all about: soul. Mann's voice, songs, and band have that in spades.\\\" Andy Hertsch, Vail Daily News\\r\\n\\r\\nSoul is something few people are able to express in song, it is something that cannot be faked nor duplicated. It is something innate and unique to each individual with it, and The Statesboro Revue's music is steeped in soul. Playing over 250 shows a year across the country while traveling in a nasty van, these guys epidomize what rock n roll is all about... Real, rowdy, and raw, The Statesboro Revue's desire to revive authentic rock n roll started in 2008 and it's taken them from one coast to another. Their unique while familiar blend of blues/gospel/soul/country/rock music may border many genres but they've found a niche and they're pushing the envelope everyday. They've taken the attitude of the Stones and Faces, the soul of Otis Redding and Leon Russell, the brawn of Zeppelin, the melancholy trance of the Allman Brothers, and the sincerity and the groove based storytelling aspect of The Band and Little Feat and created their own voice. They are a force to be reckoned with.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIFFERENT  KIND OF LIGHT\\r\\n\\\"This record is a lifetime in the making\\\" says the band's primary songwriter and front man Stewart Mann. \\\"Years of focusing on songwriting, musicianship, and the goal of incorporating all my extremely diverse influences have truly been realized with this record. I've always strived to create a sound that didn't reinvent the wheel; merely merge the little idiosyncrasies of all my many influences and shape them in a manner that might someday be looked upon as my own, unique sound. I think this record is as close as I've ever been to accomplishing that goal. I finally realized that you don't have to stick to one genre, or conform to what each individual genre typically calls for in a song. This album is extremely broad in subject matter and style, in musicality and production, and I couldn't be happier about it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter talking with Mann you get the sense he's thought this \\\"sound\\\" through for quite some time. \\\"We were playing a show in Colorado around the time I started this band, and a light bulb went on. From that point on my mission was to create groove-oriented, old-school rock n roll music, and attempt to bring back a sound that has for the most part been missing for quite some time. There are so many quality rock n roll bands out there, but none have really reached the \\\"mainstream\\\" so to speak in quite some time. The bands that call themselves rock bands now are a joke, and I'm just glad there are some real, authentic rock bands making some underground waves right now. I don't know what we are necessarily, rock, soul, blues, country, Americana, southern rock, take your pick. All I know is every song we put out has substance to it, heart and soul, fire and grit. Call it what you want, all we can do is keep making the music we believe in. A huge part of our sound is the caliber of talent I have behind me, and it's a beautiful thing.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThat talent Mann is referring to is a star-studded lineup from a wide array of backgrounds, and their cohesiveness and staying power is frightening. From the top, lead guitar players(that's right they have two) Garrett Mann and Marcus Bucci would be remarkable on their own, but together the magic they create is something that comes along once in a lifetime. Garrett Mann is the tasty, lick oriented player who can sit back when needed but can also step right up and take over a show when called upon. Bucci, on the other hand, is the driving force behind the wall of incendiary guitar playing that has come to be a Statesboro Revue staple. The two complement each other and work so well with one another you'd think they'd been playing for 10 years together...not even a year, which is also frightening. Their concise use of dual slide guitar parts, lap steel, and dobro truly showcase the depth of talent each player possesses. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the bass guitar is Berklee graduate Rob Alton, who provides the backbone and foundation while somehow managing to mix in melodic leads and runs that only a player of his caliber could even fathom. His funk and soul background fits perfectly with Mann's groove-laden tunes. Drummer Mike Peters has grown up quickly over the last two years on the road. His ability to drive the driving tunes and lay down a lazy snare for the slow groovers help further the dancing frenzy that ensues at a Statesboro Revue show. Rounding out the lineup is singer/songwriter Stewart Mann, whose soulful, powerful, and incommensurable voice truly sets The Statesboro Revue apart from other bands. Ranging from Plant-like calls to Van Morrison like precision and beauty, his ability to dive into the emotion of his songs and vary his attack and timbre is something rarely seen or heard. Combined with his knack for hooky, groove-filled songs, Mann is about as diverse as a singer/songwriter comes. \\r\\n\\r\\nReminiscent of singers and songwriters of decades back, his voice and soul are both evident and familiar, all the while unique and prodigious. While singing, playing harp, or guitar, Stewart truly wears his heart on his sleeve and is not afraid to showcase that vulnerability and emotion that no doubt go into each and every song he writes. He is a true American poet, and his lyrical ability proves that he has in fact been honing his craft for quite some time. The savvy and prowess of this band is a force to be reckoned with, and if you've seen them you'll realize for yourself why Rolling Stone said they were one of the highlights of SXSW 2009. With the new album, an indie label deal, & sponsorships rolling in, don't stand in their way, just get up & groove with 'em. \\r\\n\\r\\nNicholas Marks ~Indie World\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":151},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":151},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":151},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":151},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":151},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-og.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":151},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":89},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":151},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":151},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":151},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/87/61/25-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":170,\"height\":151}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.statesbororevue.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/thestatesbororevue\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/statesbororevue\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/statesbororevue\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"statesbororevue\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.granadatheater.com/event/1317703?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
