Osborne\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Years before they climbed the country charts with songs like \\\"Stay a Little Longer\\\" and \\\"Rum,\\\" the Brothers Osborne grew up in Deale, Maryland, a small fishing town on the Atlantic seaboard. It was a cozy place, filled with blue-collar workers who made their living on the water. During the weekends, many of those workers would head over to the Osborne household, where a series of loose, all-night jam sessions filled the Maryland air with the sounds of Bob Seger, Hank Williams, Tom Petty and George Jones. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Osborne siblings strummed their first chords during those jam sessions. From the very start, TJ Osborne was the brother with the voice. He sang in a thick, low baritone, crooning like Johnny Cash long before he was even old enough to drive. Older brother John, on the other hand, was the family's guitar shredder, his fingers capable of down-home bluegrass licks, arena-worthy rock riffs, country twang, and everything in between. Combined, the two Osbornes could play everything from traditional country music to rock & roll, creating a broad, full-bodied sound that would eventually fill the 11 songs on their major-label debut, Pawn Shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike its title suggests, Pawn Shop offers a little bit of everything. There's bluesy slide guitar, country duets, southern rock solos, harmonies, and plenty of groove. The hooks are big, the guitars are loud, and the songs \u2014 every last one of them co-written by the Osbornes, who reached out to award-winning songwriters like Shane McAnally and Ross Copperman for help \u2014 introduce a duo whose music bridges the gap between the mainstream and the alternative world. Some songs were written at home in Nashville, while others came together on the road, where the guys spent several years headlining their own club shows, touring the country with Darius Rucker, and playing some of the biggest arenas in America with fellow rule-breaker Eric Church. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Most duos are built on singing,\\\" says TJ \\\"But John is an incredible guitar player, and this band is built on me singing and John playing guitar. It gives us two parallels that work nicely together.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It's like an old-school rock approach,\\\" adds John, who cites classic bands like Aerosmith and the Allman Brothers as influences on the duo's dynamic. \\\"Groups like that always had the lead singer as well as the sideman guitar player. That's what we're going for, too. We're carving our own path in country music.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat unique path has already led the band toward the upper half of the country charts. \\\"Rum\\\" got them there first, mixing the feel-good sunshine of a beach tune with a far more realistic storyline. There's no actual beach in \\\"Rum,\\\" after all. Instead, Brothers Osborne turn the song into a tribute to the simple pleasures that their Maryland hometown offers: friends, good weather, and the occasional drink. They even filmed the song's music video in Deale, filling the clip with footage of friends, relatives, and locals. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Most people we grew up with don't go to these beautiful beaches,\\\" says TJ. \\\"They can't afford to do it. They don't have the time for it. What we're most familiar with is people going to the local bars and hanging out with each other.\\\" John adds, \\\"We tried to have the biggest time possible with what little we had. 'Rum' explains that.\\\" The brothers agree, \\\"We had to say it from our own perspective.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA similar theme runs throughout \\\"Dirt Rich\\\" and \\\"Pawn Shop,\\\" two songs that stress the importance of appreciating what you've got. Pawn Shop dishes up plenty of love songs, too, from \\\"Loving Me Back\\\" \u2014 an old-school country duet featuring vocals from Lee Ann Womack \u2014 to \\\"Stay a Little Longer,\\\" the band's biggest hit to date. While a three-minute guitar solo brings \\\"Stay a Little Longer\\\" to an epic, anthemic close, Brothers Osborne also devote time to more laid-back songs, from the nostalgic California country of \\\"21 Summer\\\" to the 420-friendly \\\"Greener Pastures.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrothers Osborne, who co-produced the album with Jay Joyce (the award-winning producer behind Little Big Town's Painkiller, Eric Church's The Outsiders, and Carrie Underwood's Storyteller), recorded most of Pawn Shop during breaks in their busy touring schedule, using members of their own touring band rather than session musicians from the Nashville community. The result is an album that's stamped with the unmistakable mark of a band. It doesn't sound like two singers, flanked by anonymous players. Instead, it sounds like a group of road warriors who've spent years sharing bus seats and hotel rooms, creating the sort of chemistry that can't be faked. Pawn Shop is both raw and real, and Brothers Osborne \u2014 who, years after those household jam sessions in Deale, now have a handful of nationwide tours under their belts, songs on the charts, and a career on the rise \u2014 are no longer a family secret.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-og.jpg\",\"width\":1500,\"height\":1000},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/33/83-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.brothersosborne.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/BrothersOsborne\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/brothersosborne\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"brothersosborne\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1664659,\"name\":\"LANco\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Who is LANco?  LANco is the people you know and the life you live, reimagined.  LANco is the familiar, couched in the extraordinary.  LANco is a connection to community built by the bonds of music.  They are five best friends making music and working to create something bigger while grinding it out on the road to build an identity.  Through this, they became Lancaster & Company, now known as LANco.  Everyone touched by their music becomes part of the Company.  The band is nothing without the Company.  The musical mission statement: Facing all that life has to offer; the good, the bad, and the ugly and embracing it through music.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTogether, LANco is Brandon Lancaster (lead vocals), Chandler Baldwin (bass), Jared Hampton (keyboards, banjo), Tripp Howell (drums), and Eric Steedly (lead guitar).\\r\\n\\r\\nFormed in 2012, LANco was born of a chance meeting between Howell and Nashville native Lancaster \u2013 each performing in bands at the same festival \u2013 just as Howell was readying a move to Music City the same week that Lancaster was returning from college.  Once in Nashville, Lancaster met Steedly through mutual friends, while Hampton and Baldwin followed shortly thereafter, with the young band gigging at every opportunity.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMining a catalog of songs written by Lancaster, the group began to develop its sound.  Making the most of Howell's day job in a carpet warehouse, the guys would slip in at night to rehearse on the little-traveled second level, loading their gear up and down with a forklift until they realized they could safely hide it with carpet between rehearsals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was Lancaster's side job \u2013 working a concession stand at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena \u2013 that opened a big door for the band when he spotted producer Jay Joyce at a concert in 2014.  A fan of Joyce's work as producer of such acts as Little Big Town and Eric Church, Lancaster recalls with a smile, \\\"I closed down my hot dog stand and walked up to Jay and just introduced myself.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation brought an invitation from Joyce for Lancaster to share some songs that he'd written, and shortly thereafter, for a band audition.    \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"One week we're playing in a carpet warehouse, and a few weeks later, we're playing live in Jay Joyce's studio,\\\" marvels Lancaster, \\\"and he's like, 'Okay, we've gotta make a record; let's do this.'\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first result of their collaboration is LANco's four-song EP, Extended Play.  Featured tracks include the lead single, \\\"Long Live Tonight,\\\" as well as \\\"We Do,\\\" \\\"American Love Story\\\" and \\\"Trouble Maker.\\\"  The EP offers first-time LANco listeners a taste of the distinctive style that defines the band's music, from production to songwriting. Download \\\"Extended Play\\\" here and stream it on Spotify here.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It's country music in a way that hasn't been done before,\\\" Lancaster observes.  \\\"No other band that's out right now has the production and the dynamics of the music that I think that we have in ours.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying forward one of the core traditions of great country music, Lancaster adds that you'll find \\\"aspects of classic country songwriting within the music; we have stories being told.\\\"  But even in its storytelling, LANco is carving a lyrical niche, with writing designed to offer \\\"unique perspectives of very universal situations.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow looking forward to the release of their upcoming full-length debut album \u2013 also produced by Joyce \u2013 LANco is among the first acts signed to Sony Music Nashville since the arrival of new Chairman & CEO Randy Goodman.  Assigned to the label group's Arista Nashville imprint (home to Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood, and more), the band was an immediate win with Goodman, who offered them a deal on the spot the first time he heard them live.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the band's live performance energy is becoming one of their undeniable calling cards \u2013 and a big part of that is being able to engage the audience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I want people to not just hear the music, but be a part of the music.  All the songs that we're playing and singing, they're really talking about people's lives, and they're talking about situations that every person's familiar with, and we're doing it with a lot of energy and a lot of crowd participation.  I always go out in the crowd and sing, and we're very interactive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We are LANco, and so are you.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.lancomusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/lancomusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/lancomusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"lancomusic\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://variety-playhouse.com/event/1279663?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
