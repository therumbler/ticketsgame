It\u2019s good-time, groove-based, stank-faced dance music with a jazz heart and a funky soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nPut it this way: let\u2019s say Huggy Bear is getting down with Foxy Brown . . . the El Dorado\u2019s still warm in the driveway, Baretta\u2019s flickering on the Magnavox, and the Way Downs are what\u2019s spinning on the hi-fi. Aw yeah, now you got it!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Way Downs started in 1995 as a bass, drums, and sax crew called the Jack Buddha Trio. The JB3 had a nice run around the Portland area, playing clubs, parties, and big-time events. After a bit of a hiatus, the band added some pieces and re-formed in 2006 as a quintet and is currently performing as a septet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Way Downs have played with Devin Phillips, Will Bernard, Das Vibenbass, The Quick and Easy Boys, Seoul Brother 1, The Excellent Gentlemen, Brownish Black, Trio Subtonic, Poncho Luxurio, The Goodfoot Allstars, and Maurice Brown at venues such as The Goodfoot, The Blue Monk, The Laurelthirst, Someday Lounge, Biddy Mcgraw\u2019s, The Bitter End, The Tiger Bar, The White Eagle, Double Mountain Brewery, Everybody\u2019s Brewing, and The San Dune Pub.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Way Downs are:\\r\\n\\r\\nDevon Detweiler \u2013 vocals, flute\\r\\n\\r\\nBruce Withycombe \u2013 baritone saxophone, alto saxophone\\r\\n\\r\\nMatt Moor \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn\\r\\n\\r\\nPat Munson \u2013 guitar, vocals\\r\\n\\r\\nMaynard Scott \u2013 keys, tenor saxophone\\r\\n\\r\\nMatt Sherman \u2013 bass\\r\\n\\r\\nLorenzo Ciacci \u2013 drums\\r\\n\\r\\nDevon Detweiler\\r\\n\\r\\nA native of Hawaii, Devon attributes her island roots and her pseudo-military upbringing to her rather compulsive tendency to simultaneously hang loose and bounce around all over the place.  Her travels have taken her to some crazy places and she has spent considerable amounts of time on all 7 continents meeting some pretty awesome/weird/amazing/freaky people.  She fantasizes about going to space more than any sane human really should and has always had a not-so-secret desire to climb Mt. Everest, even though she is totally ok with the fact that she will probably never do it.  Her tastes in music are as far reaching (and sometimes just as questionable) as her tastes in men, friends, fashion, cuisine, pastimes and possible career paths, but she accepts her poorer choices as a part of the process of evolution and extols herself endlessly for her occasional manifestations of awesomeness.  She has been playing music since she was 7 and melting faces (and the occasional heart) with her voice since she discovered that her soul might actually reside in her vocal cords.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nBruce Withycombe\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen not tooting his own horn, Bruce likes to embellish his minor accomplishments and name-drop (like the time he attended a World Series baseball game with Ted Turner and appeared on David Letterman).  On occasion those toots can sometimes sound almost musical, and when they do, he likes to be sure there is a band around to give his random honks and snorts some structure.  While Bruce has successfully applied this model to acts like The Decemberists, The Violent Femmes, Bobby Bare Jr., Jujuba, Jerry Joseph & the Jackmormons, The Kathy Walker Band and a few others, it\u2019s his ability to skip rehearsal, show up on-time for gigs, and order jello shots that have made him an essential part of the Way Downs sound.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMatt Moor\\r\\n\\r\\nMatt is the walking definition of an audiophile. His den houses a rather intimidating collection of records and an impressive hi-fi setup, which is somewhat reminiscent of those old Maxell cassette ads, as the chair in front of his massive speakers will actually blow the hair out of your face if you happen to have any.  Even though Matt has an eclectic selection of musical talents and offerings, it is probably people\u2019s desire to solve the eternal mystery of what is happening under that hat coupled with his well-known adamancy about Sade\u2019s \u201cSoldier of Love\u201d being THE best album to get busy to that makes him so highly sought after, both onstage and off.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPat Munson\\r\\n\\r\\nPatrick Munson was playing in bands before it was cool. He has been a member of more musical troupes over the years than he cares to recall and that most people will not. His instruments include: guitar, bass, lap steel, mandolin, and ukulele. Patrick also sings, writes songs, and once made a video called Albino Raindrops that actually won some awards.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMaynard Scott\\r\\n\\r\\nSpawned in a land bereft of soul and yearning to unoxymoronize the moniker \u2018Utah Jazz\u2019, Maynard has been playing soul/funk/noisyjazz since the late eighties with the likes of Swee Rhino and JB3 prior to forming the Way Downs.  A multi-instrumentalist, his primary toys are keyboards and saxophone.  His heroes include Jimmy McGriff, Pharaoh Sanders, Booker T, Otis Redding and the Boxcar Kids.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMatt Sherman\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally raised in the swampy lowlands of Borneo by a group of\\r\\n\\r\\ngibbons, Matt Sherman was trapped by English fur traders and sold into\\r\\n\\r\\nPortland\u2019s then-illegal, underground funk trade. Matt Sherman has\\r\\n\\r\\nbrought the dulcet sounds of his bass to bands like Calobo, The Crack\\r\\n\\r\\nCity Rockers, and the JB3.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLorenzo Ciacci\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting at an early age, he began making noise on any given surface or kitchen utensil within reach. Upon acquiring a drumset he proceeded to confuse and annoy family members and friends alike. After a considerable amount of subterfuge and misdirection, Lorenzo joined his first band where he continued to confuse and annoy, this time, paying audiences as well as friends and relatives.  One of the founding members of the early inception of The Way Downs, known as JB3, he has always been fascinated with the funky musics and the endless amounts of fun that tend to occur when played with good people. Over the years he has composed music for video games, commercials, television and movies, largely when people didn\u2019t know where else to turn or whom else to speak with.  Lorenzo has had the pleasure, and caused much misfortune or displeasure to play and/or work with the following acts. . . . Mannheim Steamroller, Henry Kaiser, TOOL, OWL, Tinzen, Xing, Deep Sky, ambr.sea, Hybrid, G.S. Sachdev, Sidecar, The Brother Egg, Slugabed, Zakir Hussain, The Me, Big Foam Finger and even more people and acts that you\u2019ve never ever heard of, or would want to run into in a dark alley, let alone have coffee with.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":666},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":208},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":139},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-og.jpg\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":694},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":69},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":347},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":451},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/86/88/07-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/182437851&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\\\"><\\/iframe>\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thewaydowns.net\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/The-Way-Downs-123878376384/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":684513,\"name\":\"Karyn Ann\",\"startTime\":\"2016-12-31 21:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"Karyn Ann is a geologist\u2026a graduate level geologist.

To quote Neil Young \u2013 she is a miner for a heart of gold.  In her own words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI am most connected to songwriting that touches upon subject matter that describes an unknown or a fear that I can\u2019t quite grasp, or don\u2019t know how or want to confront.  These are the songs that make sense of my emotions\u2026.as a friend once said to me, \u2018these are not songs for music\u2019s sake, these are songs for journaling\u2019\u2026\u2019cause what words are worth thinking, when they are left in your head?\u2019\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nA dedicated student of Blues, Soul and Gospel,  Karyn\u2019s singing and songwriting follow a long line from the piano roll Blues and Jazz of the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s onward thru 60\u2019s troubadours such as Bonnie Raitt to modern day artists like Shawn Colvin, Joan Osborne, Martin Sexton, Brandi Carlisle, Fiona Apple and Foy Vance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving released her first CD, Accept Uncertainty in 2013, Karyn is an up and comer in the expansive Portland music scene with performances at a range of venues including The Alberta Rose Theatre, Mississippi Studios, The Secret Society Ballroom as well as McMenamin\u2019s Al\u2019s Den and White Eagle venues to name just a few.
