And yet, as their fans across the globe are well aware, EPICA has never been a band to play it safe, and they've never made the same album twice. EPICA has earned its reputation as one of the foremost symphonic metal bands by repeatedly shattering expectations and pushing the very limits in the genre.  This spring, EPICA will proudly unveil the next stage of their ongoing musical evolution: The Quantum Enigma, their sixth full-length studio album. This is EPICA like you've never heard them before: The Quantum Enigma sounds larger than life, expertly mixing devilishly sharpguitars, angelic choruses, evocative synthesizers, mind-boggling drum work, and of course, another soaring vocal performance from Simone Simons. The Quantum Enigma is simultaneously the band's most intense and emotional release to date. Mark Jansen credits increased collaboration between members of the band -- which also includes lead guitarist Isaac Delahaye, keyboardist Coen Janssen, drummer Ari\u00ebn van Weesenbeek, bassist Rob van der Loo, as a key factor in the creation of what is surely EPICA's edgiest, most forward-thinking album yet: \\\"More than any of our previous albums, The Quantum Enigma is the result of a group effort. Even though the basic components of each song were still written by individual band members, we sat together to start working on the material as a solid team early in the process, playing the songs in a live setting and dive into the microscopic (quantum) world of the little details, comparing dozens of amps, snares, and mics in order to find the sound that would be able to beat all of our previous albums. A time consuming experience, but the only way to reach our ultimate goal: creating the album that could lift EPICA up to the next level.\\\"The band's quest to annihilate artistic stagnation continued with their choice of behind-the-scenes collaborators: after five albums of successfully working with producer Sascha Paeth (who still played an important role during the pre-production sessions), EPICA opted to record The Quantum Enigma with the up-and-coming Joost van den Broek at Sandlane Recording Facilities in the Netherlands. \\\"After many years, there comes a point at which you want to try out some new methods in order to keep yourself fully motivated, and to refresh your music and mind. This was such a turning point for us. It was time to leave our comfort zone in order to explore new horizons. In producer Joost van den Broek, we found the guy who was able to get the best out of us with his patience, guru-like skills and loads of energy.\\\"The Quantum Enigma also marks the first collaboration between EPICA and mixer Jacob Hansen (Volbeat, Hatesphere, Amaranthe).  \\r\\n\\\"Jacob really impressed us by giving the band a massive sound without compromising on all the symphonic and orchestral elements which color our music. Every detail finds its way into a perfectly balanced mix, and makes EPICA sound raw and overwhelming.\\\"Given the boundary-defying nature of the music on The Quantum Enigma, it's appropriate that the album's lyrics were inspired by the most mind-bending scientific proof in all of quantum physics: one that posits that our physical environment is directly influenced by our consciousness. We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are. Ultimately, everything in the universe is energy and energy is influenced by the mind. Therefore the mind creates and controls reality.  These heady themes reflect in the lyrics of both Mark Jansen and Simone Simons, the latter of whom calls The Quantum Enigma\\\"an exploration of the subconscious mind\\\".Those lyrical concepts, combined with the undeniable power of the music, ensure that The Quantum Enigma is not just an album -- it's an experience. The Quantum Enigma will be released on the 2nd of May 2014 in Europe and on the 13th of May in North America via Nuclear Blast Records.  EPICA plans to support its release with plenty of touring, once again bringing their grandiose, unforgettable live show to fans across the globe.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/15/14/59-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.epica.nl/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/epica\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/epica?v=app_2405167945\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/epica\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"epica\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1599421,\"name\":\"Fleshgod Apocalypse\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\\\"Fleshgod Apocalypse is a brutal death metal band from Rome, Italy formed in 2007 by Hour of Penance member Francesco Paoli (Drums/Guitars/Backing vocals) , Christiano Trionfera (Guitars) and Paolo Rossi (Vocals/Bass,Promaetheus Unbound).

The band, at the time still known as Hyperborea, comprised Masha \\\"Scream\\\" Arhipova (vocals), Eugene Knyazev (guitar), Eugene Borzov (bass), Ilya Bogatyryov (guitar), Alexander \\\"Warlock\\\" Korolyov (drums), and Olga Loginova (keyboard), but it wasn't until February 2002 that ARKONA surfaced from the depths of Russia's underground scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nARKONA soon decided to record several of their pagan/folk songs for their first demo. The recording took place at CDM-Records Studio in December 2002. The demo included 3 tracks \u2013 \\\"Kolyada\\\", \\\"Solntsevorot\\\" (Solstice)\\\" & \\\"Rus'\\\" (Russia). These tracks were later included as a bonus on the live album \\\"Zhizn' vo slavu\\\" (Live for the Great) released in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nARKONA began performing live in early 2003. Many concert-goers experienced the band for the first time at the Yazycheskaya Rus\\\" Festival.  By the summer of 2003, ARKONA was ready to record their debut, but disinterest in the band by some of its members saw the band disappear from the scene as quickly as it had arrived.  Yet Masha's perseverance would not subside.  Continuing on her own, and with the help of the members of Nargathrond, she proceeded to compose new material. Her fellow musicians readied their instruments, read through the partitions, and without ever looking back, recorded their debut album \\\"Vozrozhdenie\\\" (Revival) in March 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Vozrozhdenie\\\" (Revival) quickly became one of the most successful Slavic pagan metal albums of all time. As soon as the studio work was completed, Masha dedicated herself to the creation of new songs and by the end of summer 2004, the material for the second album \\\"Lepta\\\" (The Contribution) was completed.  With the support of the same line-up, the band finished the recordings in autumn. \\\"Lepta\\\" was released in December 2004 and presented the listener with a darker and gloomier style. ARKONA was also supported by poet and vocalist Les'yar (Nevid', ex-Butterfly Temple), who not only performed, but also wrote the lyrics for \\\"Zarnitsy Nashei.Svobody\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album's release placed ARKONA back on the scene as a contending force. With a complete line-up, ARKONA returned to the stages in the beginning of 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn ever-espousing fountain of creativity, Masha continued writing new material and by the summer of 2005, ARKONA was recording their next album. \\\"Vo Slavu Velikim\\\" (For the Glory of Great) proved to be the most complicated and varied album thus far, as the band withdrew from the use of synthesized sounds, replacing them with authentic folk instruments. As such, the list of guest musicians grew considerably including the renowned folk musician Vladimir Cherepovskiy (Mervent, ex- Voinstvo Sidov, Veter Vody, Trio Mario), as well as members of Svarga and Alkonost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the arrangements for each song at times exceeded 100 recorded tracks, ARKONA was able to finally piece together the album and \\\"Vo Slavu Velikim!\\\" (For the Glory of Great) was finally released in September 2005. During the touring that followed in support of the album's release, ARKONA recorded their performance for the purpose of releasing a DVD and the live album \\\"Zhizn' vo Slavu\\\". Fueled by their outstanding achievements, ARKONA opted not to rest on its laurels and made sure to return with a new album as soon as possible. Fans heard a preview of \\\"Ot Serdca K Nebu\\\" (From the Heart to the Sky) at the 2008 Ragnarok Festival. In addition, the band embarked on a 30-day tour throughout Europe with Brutal Assault being just one of the highlights.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack at home, ARKONA decided not to take a break, but to immediately begin working on their fifth album. In order to top their previous effort, the band aimed to create something unique. While working on \\\"Goi, Rode, Goi!\\\", the band also planned their second DVD. \\\"Noch Velesova\\\" was released via Napalm Records in May 2009. ARKONA also performed at the German festival Winternoise, taking a well-deserved break from the arduous recording process.\\r\\nUpon their return, ARKONA continued to work on the new album, completing the recordings in June 2009. It was quite an enterprise, as over 40 musicians were involved in the making of \\\"Goi, Rode, Goi!\\\". The band described the process as the most labor-intensive and time-consuming work in its history. ARKONA made use of a full-fledged chorus and string quintet for the first time in their career. The heart of the album is undoubtedly the 15-minute saga 'Na Moey Zemle' that relates the adventures of a Slav in European countries. This epic features the voices of members of Manegarm, Menhir, and Heidevolk, among others. Vladimir Cherepovsky and Vladimir \\\"Volk!, who has recently become a full-time member of ARKONA, are responsible for the traditional instruments on the album. The artwork was again the work of the legendary Kris Verwimp. He delivered a series of conceptual illustrations for each song on the album.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result was worth the hard work, as \\\"Goi, Rode, Goi!\\\" proved to be the next logical step in the band's journey.  Fans would experience the live power of the new material at numerous live performances. ARKONA also produced video clips to the title track, the anthem \\\"Yarilo\\\", as well as the melancholic \\\"Liki Bessmertnykh Bogov\\\". The band played numerous shows in support of the new album and also released an EP in the summer of 2011 to ease the fans' anticipatory wait for the upcoming album.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe members of Arkona have already managed to make a name for themselves within the pagan metal scene that extends way beyond the borders of their native Russia. Their new album \\\"Slovo\\\" acknowledges their well-earned reputation with outstanding tracks. The band revolving around lead warrior Masha Scream has managed to outshine all past efforts. \\\"Slovo\\\" bundles Arkona's strengths and catapults the band to new musical heights. The foundation of blast beats, double bass attacks, and heavy riffs remain, yet it is the attention to detail that rounds off Arkona's multi-faceted sound. Folk melodies, complex vocal lines and choruses, clean vocals and growls, orchestral passages, and authentic instruments (violins, flutes, etc.) serve to embellish \\\"Slovo\\\". The diversified end result features epic ballads and heavy folk-oriented tracks bound for certain glory at upcoming live performances. Masha's Russian lyrics add a hardened, yet melancholic touch to this latest work. Once again, Arkona has chosen master illustrator Kris Verwimp (Vintersorg, M\u00e5negarm, Thyrfing, etc.) to design the album's artwork. \\\"Slovo\\\" is an album full of highlights destined for yet another impressive victory on the pagan metal battlefield.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":398},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":398},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":199},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-og.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":398},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":332},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":332},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":398},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/17-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":600,\"height\":398}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.arkona-russia.com/en/enews/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/arkonarussia\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Arkonarussia\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Arkonarussia\"},{\"id\":1599425,\"name\":\"The AGONIST\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Over the course of three full-lengths The Agonist have proved they're no \\\"Flavor of the Week.\\\" Through great songs, hard work, and an ardent fanbase, the Montreal-based five-piece quickly established themselves as torchbearers of a new generation of Canadian metal, much of it on the shoulders of founding members Danny Marino, Chris Kells, and Alissa White-Gluz. Throughout the last decade, The Agonist spread their respective wings wide, touring with an array of notable artists, including Danzig, Kamelot, Corrosion of Conformity, Enslaved, Kittie, and Epica.\\r\\nTimes and circumstances change, however. After parting ways with White-Gluz in 2014\u2014she's now center stage in labelmates Arch Enemy\u2014, The Agonist set out to find a new vocalist. For a split second, the group considered a frontman to replace White-Gluz, but quickly realized the dynamic wouldn't work. Searching high and low, they found American vocalist Vicky Psarakis on Youtube. Psarakis wasn't just covering songs by Iron Maiden, Nevermore, Adele, and Nightwish in the comfort of her home studio. She was magically altering them. Her online performance was enough for The Agonist to request an audition, for which she nailed and the rest is history. \\\"The change has actually been quite smooth overall,\\\" guitarist Marino acknowledges. \\\"Part in thanks to Vicky's ability to rise to the occasion and our fans open mindedness. I think the fact that the Agonist has often gone outside the box musically has attracted fans that welcome change and new things pretty easily.\\\"\\r\\nThe Agonist, now with Psarakis fronting, are preparing to unfurl Eye of Providence. Powerful, diverse, aggressive, and epic are all buzzwords used to describe the group's fourth full-length. Album opener \\\"Gates of Horn and Ivory\\\" immediately shows The Agonist's intentions. There is no escape from Marino and Pascal Jobin's aggro-melodic riffing, Kells' storm-like bass, and Simon McKay's thunderous drums. And no doubt will Psarakis' screams, growls, and full-bodied clean vocals floor longtime fans and hook new acolytes. This is The Agonist reborn! This fact couldn't be truer in lead single, \\\"Disconnect Me\\\". The frontwoman immediately demonstrates she's ready to be in the ruling class of metal singers, while the rest of her bandmates cleverly pound out a killer song as if it's nothing. Turns out, Eye of Providence was effortlessly awesome to make.\\r\\nSays Marino: \\\"It was a whole new experience and the most enjoyable we've ever had. There was an air of full collaboration like never before. It was a good balance of group effort and individual composition and understanding that balance. While Vicky and I were the main composers, every member composed\\r\\npart of this album and this was the first album, where lyrical content was also shared between Vicky, Simon, and myself.\\\"\\r\\nThe Eye of Providence, or God's all-seeing eye, is a piece of religious iconography with origins stemming back to ancient Egypt. But The Agonist aren't going all History Channel on their new album. The lyrical center isn't about pyramids, the Freemasons, or its appearance on the United States one-dollar bill. As on previous albums, The Agonist are commenting heavily on advances in monitoring technology, particularly as it relates to governments intruding on the private lives of its citizens. \\\"We are embracing a number of new topics,\\\" admits Marino with a cryptic smile. \\\"The Agonist still wants to be a voice for change. However, there are many socio-political and personal topics that we haven't yet covered. We get into some of those on this record.\\\"\\r\\nRecorded at The Grid Studio (Beneath the Massacre, Beyond Creation) with longtime producer Christian Donaldson, Eye of Providence sounds incomparable to albums previous. Donaldson captured The Agonist fresh, alive, and, most importantly, heavy. They fed viciously off a spontaneous and collaborative work environment and ended up with a record that's completely \\\"in the moment\\\". So much so, an injury to Jobin's hand forced him to approach a solo with a little innovation. \\\"While tracking \\\"Disconnect Me\\\" Paco punched a wall,\\\" Marino laughs. \\\"He ended up breaking a bone in his finger, but he still had to write and track his guitar solo. Since picking was very difficult he ended up writing the whole solo using tapping. The solo ended up really cool and like nothing he's really done before. So, in the end, it was a good thing he punched that wall!\\\"\\r\\nIf The Agonist were to weather a storm it wouldn't be the departure of White-Gluz and the arrival of Psarakis. The great struggle is making a record that sounds like The Agonist. A fingerprint solely made from five individuals with like motivations and goals. Eye of Providence is that record. It is The Agonist's crowning achievement to date. \\\"I feel like we have come into our own sound, especially on Eye of Providence,\\\" says Marino proudly. \\\"I am influenced by artists like Devin Townsend and Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt. I am inspired by artists with the courage to take a listener to many different places in one album. That's what we have been trying to do since our second album [Lullabies for the Dormant Mind]. With the Eye of Providence we were able to find that balance.\\\"\\r\\nAs with many bands so to with The Agonist. They live and breathe on stage. In fact, if a song doesn't pass the \\\"live test\\\" it doesn't make it on the album. The music is only right when it can be translated from the stage to The Agonist's rabid fanbase. So, expect to see The Agonist in 2014 and 2015 all over the world. And be fully ready to hear the total brilliance of Eye of Providence.\\r\\n\\r\\nVicky Psarakis \u2013 Vocals\\r\\nDanny Marino \u2013 Guitar\\r\\nChris Kells \u2013 Bass\\r\\nSimon McKay- Drums\\r\\nPascal \\\"Paco\\\" Jobin \u2013 Guitar\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":180,\"height\":215},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":180,\"height\":215},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":180,\"height\":215},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":180,\"height\":215},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-og.jpg\",\"width\":180,\"height\":215},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":119},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":180,\"height\":215},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":180,\"height\":215},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":180,\"height\":215},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/13/62/19-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":180,\"height\":215}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.mutinywithin.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://myspace.com/theagonist\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/TheAgonistOfficial\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/theagonist\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"theagonist\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1224205?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
