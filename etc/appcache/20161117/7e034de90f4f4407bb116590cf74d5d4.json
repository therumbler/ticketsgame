By garnering the attention of some of the world's most prolific and well-respected artists such as Above & Beyond, Paul van Dyk, Skrillex, and Ellie Goulding, among others, it is clear that his powerfully emotive, visionary brand of bass-driven electronica has broken through the status quo to unveil a rare, one-of-a-kind musical experience. With his sheer technical prowess in the studio and behind the decks, Seven Lions brings new meaning to the art of music production and performance with his masterful, intricate and imaginative compositions and live sets that shed light on his deeply impassioned motivations as a true artist. Seemingly ahead of his time, he will only continue to harness his infinite potential as a producer/DJ and further establish himself in a vanguard of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his early years as a metal and punk-inclined drummer with a fierce tenacity for success, Santa Barbara, California's Jeff Montalvo, the mastermind behind Seven Lions, decided to take matters into his own hands, rather than waiting on his band mates. After a friend gave him the production program Fruity loops, it was history. Montalvo was set on an auspicious path to revamp the dance music industry as we know it - not as a drummer, but as a producer. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith soulful, deep, hybridized creations - at times majestic, at others pulverizing - all distinctly his own, the 26-year-old multi-talented musician is single-handedly changing the sonic landscape for future generations to come by bridging the gap between the soaring, ethereal vibe of trance and intensely adrenalizing bass music. His breakout, contest-winning remix of Above & Beyond's \\\"You Got To Go\\\" served as his remarkable introduction to the dance music world. As the track sat at #2 on Beatport's Dubstep chart for over 6 weeks, second only to Skrillex's remix of \\\"Levels\\\" which received hundreds of thousands of listens on YouTube, it was obvious that something particularly phenomenal was imminent for Montalvo. \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing up on the recent release of his inventive collaboration with Minnesota, \\\"Fevers\\\" featuring Mimi Page, that amassed almost 200,000 SoundCloud plays in just under a month, Montalvo has offered a gripping, emotion-fueled song, \\\"Strangers\\\" with Myon & Shane and Tove Lo, as his contribution for The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones official soundtrack. Prior to \\\"Fevers\\\" and \\\"Strangers,\\\" he dropped his transcendent Days To Come EP on the highly-influential OWSLA imprint. The EP's ascent to #2 on the US iTunes Dance Charts and #1 on Beatport, serves as a testament to his truly inimitable sound and forward-thinking mentality. Montalvo also boasts a jaw-dropping portfolio of remixes and bootlegs for the likes of Tritonal, Paul van Dyk, Delerium, Superbus, Matrix and Futurebound, Oceanlab, and Florence and the Machine, among others, that exemplify his innate ability to completely transform a song into an extraordinary masterpiece that incorporates fundamental elements from the original, while still maintaining his definitive Seven Lions sound. Over the course of his brief career thus far, this sound has already been recognized by the top EDM publications such as Dancing Astronaut, Gotta Dance Dirty, Chubby Beavers, Vibe, Less Than 3, The Untz, Mixmag, SPIN, and even DJ Mag, where he was distinguished in an article titled, \\\"New Masters of the Mainroom.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nJust this year, Seven Lions was selected as the main support for Porter Robinson's sold-out Circle Assembly tour, made appearances at world-renowned festivals, such as SXSW, Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival New York, Global Dance Festival, and Camp Bisco, as well as headlined the Avalon Hollywood, Webster Hall New York City, and other top-tier venues in cities far and wide. With the combination of his productions and mind-blowing sets that have proved to cement his meteoric rise to superstardom, the time is now for the burgeoning young talent that aims to make a lasting, positive impact on the world through his art. Montalvo's other-worldly creativity and purposeful ambition is genuinely limitless as he has a number of monumental projects that are developing, including a new single for OWSLA in addition to an official remix of R\u00f6yksopp's \\\"Run into the Sea,\\\" and a massive North American tour with Krewella set for the Fall. Fans will just have to wait and see what exactly will come of the future Seven Lions experience, but one thing can be certain - there will be more pioneering music and awe-inspiring performances.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":890,\"height\":558},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":188},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":188},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":125},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":125},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-og.jpg\",\"width\":890,\"height\":558},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":63},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":63},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":313},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":313},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":408},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/25/96/09-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":408}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"7KfKft2lcog\",\"title\":\"Seven Lions Mix [Melodic Dubstep / Chillstep]\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KfKft2lcog\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KfKft2lcog\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://soundcloud.com/seven-lions\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/SevenLions\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/SevenLionsMusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"SevenLionsMusic\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1285285?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
