Produced by Dave Cobb (Chris Stapleton, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell), the album features 10 new recordings, including six songs co-written by Bishop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The fact that this album is done is nothing short of a miracle,\\\" says the radiant 5'10 brunette with her 1,000-watt smile. \\\"Ain't Who I Was\\\" is the result of me letting go of the dream that I'd built my whole life around: Music.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I was at a show at 3rd & Lindsley one night two weeks before my 35th birthday. I'd been on the road making music for thirteen years and I was still barely scraping by. I had no agent, no manager, and no prospects. The stress of all those years of doing it on my own had started to take its toll and I felt an overwhelming sense of defeat. Then something just snapped. I felt like I was losing my mind. I ended up in the hospital that night after suffering from what the doctor said was a panic attack. He recommended I take some time off, so I went home, packed up my apartment and my cat and drove home to Texas the very next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"There is an emptiness that comes from being on the road all those years - from sacrificing all meaningful relationships in pursuit of the 'dream.' I realized I had become severely depressed because I had put so much pressure on myself to succeed. That's when I knew I had to let go of all of it, but I had no identity apart from Bonnie Bishop the struggling artist. If I let go of my love of music, what would I become? That was the scary part. Not knowing where my life was going.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLike saying goodbye to an old friend, Bishop (37) cut ties with music -- even selling her touring van and all of her merchandise -- and passionately focused on writing and storytelling, marking an end to a career that had kept her on the road for more than a decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was determined to let go of music and she did for the next 18 months. She stopped writing songs and found that writing stories was a way to channel her emotions. On a whim, she applied to Sewanee's prestigious MFA Creative Writing program at Sewanee University of the South and much to her surprise was accepted. That's where she was, in graduate school pursuing her new career in story-writing, when she got a call from Grammy-winning producer Dave Cobb.\\r\\n\\\"I had spent a year-and-a-half killing my dream so when Dave Cobb said he wanted to make a record on me I was terrified. But I'd never had an opportunity to work with someone of his caliber, so I said 'yes,' in spite of my fears.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n'Ain't Who I Was' is her most transparent album to date. Armed with songs from her years-deep catalog, she approached the recording process with the innocence, hope and trepidation of a new artist, but with Dave Cobb at her side.\\r\\n\\\"You can hear Bonnie's soul and heart in every note she sings,\\\" says Cobb. \\\"That's what attracted me to Bonnie; the honesty and humility in her songwriting.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Making music again felt different because I was no longer defined by it,\\\" says Bonnie. \\\"I didn't have the pressure of needing to 'succeed' in order to feel good about myself as a person. For the first time, music was fun and I have Dave Cobb to credit for that.\\\"\\r\\nShe'd grown quite an audience during her dozen-plus years on the road, earning one notable fan in particular, Bonnie Raitt, who decided to record Bishop's own \\\"Not Cause I Wanted To\\\" for her 2012 album 'Slipstream.' Not only did the song earn Bishop her first Grammy award, but it was named \\\"Song Of The Year\\\" by The New York Times' Jon Pareles.\\r\\n\\r\\nBishop's songs have also been performed by TV star Connie Britton on ABC's prime-time show \\\"Nashville,\\\" and she recently celebrated a second Bonnie Raitt cut. The slide guitar legend recorded \\\"Undone\\\" for her 20th career album 'Dig In Deep,' which hit stores in February.\\r\\n\\\"I love her work,\\\" Raitt says of Bishop, with whom she shares a first name and a rootsy swagger. \\\"She has a beautiful soul, artistry, honesty and courage. Bonnie is as gifted a prose writer as she is a musician, not to mention she's an incredible singer.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the album, she has cultivated an original web-based audio series called \\\"Story & Song\\\" which marries her creative writing with heartfelt songs of redemption and healing. (The series is available exclusively on bonniebishop.com.) Bonnie is currently planning a spring tour including stops at festivals like the Key West Songwriters' Fest in Florida and Music City Roots in Nashville.\\\"cept that, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":757,\"height\":925},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":367},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":244},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-og.jpg\",\"width\":757,\"height\":925},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":122},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":611},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":794},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/11/84/43-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"vj76tez7eyo\",\"title\":\"Bonnie Bishop performs \u201cMercy\u201d from her NEW Album \u201cAin\u2019t Who I Was\u201d (Thirty Tigers / RED)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vj76tez7eyo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vj76tez7eyo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://bonniebishop.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"https://myspace.com/bonniebishopband\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/bonniebishop\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/BonnieBishop\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"BonnieBishop\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1764805,\"name\":\"Graham Wilkinson\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Graham is constantly reinventing himself. His new album #BecauseOfYou released in June of 2016 leans heavily upon his reggae influences while seamlessly combining them with his love for rock n' roll and hip-hop. It features Adrian Quesada of Groupo Fantasma, Trevor Nealon from Band of Heathens, the Tijuana Trainwreck Horns of SHINYRIBS, as well as a rootsy, folk-country duet with Katie Shore; the fiddle player from Asleep At The Wheel.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGraham was recently selected to be in a new documentary for PBS about the person who wrote \\\"I'll Fly Away\\\"; Albert E. Brumley. Albert's granddaughter who runs their nonprofit ~ http://illflyawayfoundation.org ~ has asked artists from across the globe to put into song his notebooks of words that have no music. The documentary will be filmed mid September 2016 in Austin, Arkansas & Nashville with collaborating artists Jim Lauderdale, Dawn & Hawkes, as well as others from Austin, England, Nashville, Australia and more. Stay tuned for more updates to come!\\r\\n \\r\\nBorn in Texas, the son of a preacher and school teacher, Graham was raised on the importance of family and service to others. Over the last 7 years, Graham has independently booked himself to the sum of nearly 200 shows a year; while also being a dedicated father, husband and family man of three wonderful daughters (one in college as well as twin 6-year olds) & two dogs. The line in his song \u201cLaugh Until Life Makes Sense\u201d sums up a message of positivity and love that Graham strives to exemplify and share through his music and home life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe single \\\"FOCUS\\\" off of his 2011 release \\\"the spiritual accessories ep\\\" made it all the way to MTV.com and remained the #1 Most Shared, Most Commented On, & Most Viewed for over a week; all done as a completely independent, unsigned artist. All of this is on the foundation of his 2009 release \\\"YEARBOOK\\\" which featured Alejandro Escovedo & Hayes Carll.\\r\\n \\r\\nIn between recording, family time, & touring he has opened for such national acts as G. Love, Trevor Hall, The Gourds, Johnathan Tyler & the Northern Lights, Soul Rebels Brass Band & Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Hayes Carll, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, Greg Brown, Alejandro Escovedo and dear friend Kimya Dawson. \\r\\n\\r\\nGraham Wilkinson has been named one of Black Fret\u2019s inaugural nominees for their 2014 grant cycle.
