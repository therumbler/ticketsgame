For over thirty years the reigning kings of punk rock have remained relevant by continuing to push the boundaries of their music, lyrics and good taste in a way that's as endearing as it is infectious. For that reason it's remarkably apt that the band's latest LP 'First-Ditch Effort' is also their thirteenth because ominous black clouds hang over this collection of songs that see frontman/bassist Fat Mike exploring self-loathing and mortality in a more raw and honest way than he ever has before. Mike credits much of this to the writing process behind 'NOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub And Other Stories,' the band's New York Times Bestselling memoir that forced him to confront his ghosts and revisit his past in ways that weren't always comfortable. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This album is more personal than anything I've ever done before because once we put everything out there in the book it opened all of these doors are far as what I want to sing about\\\" Fat Mike explains. However this wouldn't sound like a NOFX album without powerful performances from guitarists Eric Melvin and El Hefe as well as drummer, Smelly. In that spirit this album also marks the first time that Melvin helped write songs and his contributions to \\\"It Ain't So Lonely At The Bottom\\\" and \\\"I Don't Like Me Anymore\\\" as well as his signature vocals on the opener \\\"Six Years On Dope\\\" add a visceral impact to these songs that will surprise even the band's most hardcore fans. \\\"It's like you don't expect it, what the fuck?\\\" Mike says of the aforementioned opener. \\\"That song reminds me of the Angry Samoans meeting the Bronx and I don't think there's anything that sounds like it.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the fact that NOFX helped invent melodic punk music (alongside their longtime peers such as Bad Religion and Rancid), they've never made the same album twice and 'First-Ditch Effort' sees them continuing to push their own musical boundaries. \\\"One of the things I'm proud of on this album is the song 'California Drought' because it's written in a rhythm that I don't think anyone has ever used before and we have a drum solo on that song,\\\" he explains as if he can't even believe it himself. Fat Mike also adds that spending the past few years working on his musical 'Home Street Home' helped subconsciously influence this album, whether it's via the fully formed harmonies or prevalence of piano. \\\"I've written so many crazy songs for the musical that even though NOFX didn't have a mold I keep pushing barriers,\\\" he responds when asked why this album sounds so inspired. \\r\\n\\r\\nFat Mike also credits producer Cameron Webb (Mot\u00f6rhead, Alkaline Trio) for helping make these songs so dynamic. \\\"Cameron had a lot of ideas that I would have never have thought of when it came to arrangements,\\\" he explains. In fact the band were so inspired that they wrote eighteen songs for the album and even came up with some ideas when they weren't even trying. \\\"The song 'Ditch Effort' just came out of nowhere from us jamming,\\\" Fat Mike recalls. \\\"That's not a normal thing for us but we just started playing and it had so much power and it felt so good to play it together so we had to put it on the album.\\\" The band also prove that they haven't lost their innate ability to craft a hook on 'First-Ditch Effort' and the conspiracy theory-rich \\\"Sid And Nancy\\\" and self-reflective rocker \\\"I Don't Like Me Anymore\\\" are two of the band's catchiest tracks to date. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever ultimately seriousness and somberness also lie at the core of 'First-Ditch Effort,' a fact that's most evident in Mike's musical eulogy to No Use For A Name's frontman Tony Sly (\\\"I'm So Sorry Tony\\\") as well the apocalyptic closer \\\"Generation Z\\\" which features guest vocals from Mike's 11-year-old daughter Darla who will also be producing the subsequent music video. \\\"A lot of people are going to look at me differently after hearing this album,\\\" Mike explains. \\\"I think I was more comfortable about being myself on this record and a large part of that is due to my relationship with my wife and involvement in the BDSM world. \\\"I used to live so much of my life in private but I've slowly started going to parties and out in public without being embarrassed of my true identity and that confidence just transferred over to my entire life,\\\" he continues. \\\"When you're dressed in rubber and heels and corset and you're waiting in line for an Omelette in Jamaica, well, after that there's nowhere else to go.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter battling skinhead punks in the eighties, major-label executives in the nineties and George W. Bush in the early 2000s, NOFX are finally ready to enjoy the success they've been too preoccupied to embrace in the past... and it's turning out to be pretty exciting. \\\"I went out with El Hefe the other night to a party and I think it was the first time we had ever hung out socially and it was a ton of fun,\\\" Fat Mike recalls. \\\"I think the process of doing the book and the book tour and making this record has brought the four of us together and formed a bond that we never would have discovered otherwise,\\\" he summarizes. That newfound revelation is inherent in even some of this First-Ditch Effort's darkest moments making it the perfect soundtrack to both a fresh start as well as the end of the world. As the band have undeniably learned over the past 33 years, sometimes it's just all about your perspective.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/19-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.nofxofficialwebsite.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/nofx\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/NOFX-Band/50433775273\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/nofxofficial\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"nofxofficial\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1705373,\"name\":\"PEARS\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The story of PEARS is not exactly an incredibly long one: The hardcore punk band came together just over a year ago, in early 2014, after its members had kicked around the New Orleans punk scene for long enough before finally wising up and realizing they were meant for each other. However, it is a story that is remarkably fast-paced: The band's first demo, \u2026In Diapers, was released days after their first practice. The band's 10-song debut album, the absolutely electrifying Go To Prison, was written over the course of 14 hours and recorded a mere five weeks after the band formed. Really, there's no way PEARS should be as good as they are\u2014something frontman Zach Quinn fully realizes. \\\"The big secret is that me and a couple of the guys were in a band called the Lollies for a few years,\\\" Quinn says. \\\"That band broke up, we took some time away from each other and then just tried to do it right this time. I guess we really kind of lucked out. We didn't make the same mistakes\u2014the same mistakes being really too fuckin' drunk to do anything.\\\"\\r\\nOf course, coming out of the NOLA scene, it's tough to be anything but debaucherous. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The city is so decadent, it's a great place to be a piece of shit,\\\" Quinn says. \\\"There's plenty of punk rock. Not a lot of it is very good, but everybody's having fun.\\\" It's that anything-goes attitude that informs Go To Prison, an album that straddles the line between in-your-face hardcore and sugar-sweet traditional pop-punk that's surprisingly lighthearted. It's evident in their logo (some might call it an homage to Fear; \\\"I haven't heard from Lee Ving's lawyers yet,\\\" chuckles Quinn), all the musical easter eggs scattered throughout the record (including references to Descendents and Suicidal Tendencies), plus an absolutely ripping cover of the Ramones' \\\"Judy Is A Punk\\\" that is one whole second shorter than the original (a feat we didn't even think possible). But just because the album comes off as humorous at times doesn't mean PEARS don't take themselves seriously. \\\"I definitely take what we do very seriously, but it doesn't mean it ain't funny,\\\" Quinn explains. \\\"Humor is an aspect of everything. People without a sense of humor are either dead or lying. There's humor in everything if you know where to look.\\\" Take, for example, the band name. \\\"The name 'PEARS' came from this really terrible mushroom trip I had,\\\" he admits. \\\"I ate way too many mushrooms and things just got really bizarre. Pears and bananas became archetypes for everything that is good and pure and everything that is terrible and shitty\u2014pears are the terrible and shitty things. After that bad trip, pears became slang between me and my friends for bullshit: 'That shit's pears.' I suggested the band name, and everybody thought that was dumb, but I talked 'em into it.\\\" The band were lucky enough to befriend Off With Their Heads frontman Ryan Young, who loved the band so much he put out Go To Prison on vinyl on his own label, Anxious And Angry, last year. Since then, PEARS have been on the road nonstop, supporting the likes of the Dwarves, the Queers, Teenage Bottlerocket and Strung Out, all leading to the re-release of Go To Prison on Fat Wreck Chords on July 24th. That's no excuse to stop working, though: While their first album might finally be hitting a record store near you this July, the band will be back in the studio recording its follow-up with none other than Fat Mike in the producer's chair. (\\\"I never thought anything like that would ever happen,\\\" Quinn says of Mike's interest in his band. \\\"I remember buying The Decline when I was 12\u2014it's really weird that I have anydegree of separation from that.\\\") While 2015 might be the busiest year of PEARS' short existence thus far, it's clear 2016 has potential to be even bigger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Honestly, what we have done up to now, I hadn't even dreamed of,\\\" Quinn admits. \\\"I'm not gonna stop climbing. I wanna see how insane this can get. We've always said the last thing we'll do as a band is play North Korea. Then we'll be done. That's the ultimate goal\u2014even if we sneak in and play to nobody. I don't care. I can't wait to see what I get to do.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":720},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":225},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":150},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1536},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":75},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":375},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":488},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/27-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://pearstheband.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/PEARStheband/timeline\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/pearstheband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"pearstheband\"},{\"id\":1705381,\"name\":\"Useless ID\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"While celebrating their twentieth year as a punk band in 2015, Useless ID were determined to make a strong, back to their roots, explosive punk rock record that would sum up their frustration, anger, love and hope. What they endeavored to create is a defining Useless ID album: State Is Burning.\\r\\nFor over two decades, Useless ID has been writing, recording and touring all over the globe. No college, no military service (nearly mandatory in Israel), no careers, just doing what they love. Doing what they felt incredibly lucky to be doing, never resting, never complacent, and never making the same album twice.\\r\\nLike most bands with this type of longevity, Useless ID has seen highs and lows, luck and the total lack of it, walking hand in hand at every turn. From basements to arenas, from tour buses to long walks with gear on their backs; from producing albums in torn up studios in Israel to making albums at The Blasting Room in America, Useless ID has experienced it all.\\r\\nWith their first new album in four years, Useless ID wanted to share their world with the rest of the world. Four friends, four punks, who have been through it all together, coming from such an unusual place. Guitarist Ishay Berger says, \u201cState Is Burning is a love letter to punk rock. It\u2019s our \u2018fuck off\u2019 to the closed minded, racist, orthodox state of mind. It\u2019s also our statement against greedy, hateful, harmful and criminal politicians that still walk proud and in power.\u201d Guitarist Guy Carmel adds, \u201cWe wanted to start dealing more with other issues, less personal and more global. It all made sense coming from this place (Israel) that the media has so much to say about but half of the time doesn\u2019t even know or understand at all.\u201d\\r\\nVocalist and bassist Yotam Ben Horin, who has spent the past couple years recording and touring his solo acoustic music, talks about his approach to State Is Burning: \u201cI reverted back to the records I grew up with and listened to them endlessly and obsessively; all the early Bad Religion records, Descendents, Propagandhi, Lagwagon, No Use For A Name, and NOFX. With more emphasis on the lyrical content, the goal was to write the best punk record we could possibly write. We took a more urgent approach this time and relied on our instincts. If it had a good energy, felt explosive or could go over well live, we kept it.\u201d\\r\\nState Is Burning marks Useless ID\u2019s return to fast, energetic, galloping, youthful punk rock\u2014hardcore punk rock\u2014the music they originally fell in love with and what formed the basis for starting the band in the first place. Ishay continues, \u201cOur band is more obsessed with this music than ever, collecting every album from every corner of the world, keeping in touch with the local scene and totally happy to be a part of the worldwide hardcore scene. We\u2019re ready as we ever were to go out and share our world with everyone, keeping in mind that this music is more than just music, it\u2019s our life.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":645},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":202},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1376},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":336},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":437},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/94/29-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Useless-ID-40123148903/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1313029?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
