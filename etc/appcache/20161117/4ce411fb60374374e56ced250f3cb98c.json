Fowler\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Ask Kevin Fowler how'd he'd describe his own music and he doesn't think twice before responding: \\\"It's country with a bad attitude. It's country with an edge. It's just beer-drinkin', hell-raisin', good-time music.\\\"\\n\\nAnd anyone who's ever been to a Kevin Fowler show knows he does far more than just talk the talk\u2014the man delivers one of the most entertaining, high-energy performances you're likely to see in country or any other genre, with a hard-ticket base that rivals many gold-selling artists. A blend of in-your-face rockin' intensity, tongue-in-cheek humor and captivating country storytelling, Kevin's music has his standing-room-only audiences hanging on every word . . . and singing right along with him. Whether it's \\\"Beer, Bait and Ammo,\\\" \\\"Cheaper to Keep Her,\\\" \\\"The Best Mistake I Ever Made,\\\" \\\"Don't Touch My Willie\\\" or any of the other unforgettable tunes that have seen him regularly perched atop the Texas music charts, Kevin's music is the product of years spent perfecting his craft.\\n\\nAnd he's not the only beneficiary. Other artists, like Montgomery Gentry (\\\"Long Line of Losers\\\"), Mark Chesnutt (\\\"The Lord Loves a Drinkin' Man\\\") and George Jones (dueting with Kevin on \\\"Me and the Boys\\\"), are among those who have recorded classic versions of Fowler songs.\\n\\nWith his career track record, it would be easy to assume Kevin must've always known music would be his life's passion. After all, how can you be this good at something and not have worked at it for a lifetime? But he admits coming to his career path later in the game than most.\\n\\n\\\"There was a day in life that changed me,\\\" Kevin recalls of the transformative epiphany he experienced at the Texas Jam in the Cotton Bowl back when he was about 20 years old. \\\"I had been dabblin' in music and played everything a little, but nothing well. Aerosmith was there. White Snake. All these bands were playing at a day-long festival. They were hosing down the crowd with big fire hoses. And it was just mayhem. I had never seen 100,000 people in one place. I remember that day going, 'Well, that's what I'm supposed to be doin'.'\\\"\\n\\nWhile Amarillo boy Kevin may not have had a clear vision of his life's path prior to that momentous day, he shouldn't have been surprised when he finally realized he was put on this earth to write songs and entertain people. After all, he'd been entertaining in one way or another since his attention-seeking days as a self-described \\\"band geek,\\\" playing drums in junior high and high school.\\n\\nBut Kevin's musical training had begun earlier when his mom, Shirley, insisted he take piano lessons, in spite of his hatred of it and his desire to play football instead. Looking back, he thinks his folks made the right call. \\\"They were probably thinkin' to themselves, 'We've seen you play football\u2014that's no good!'\\\" he laughs.\\n\\nWhile Kevin recalls knee-knocking piano recitals as his first experience with live performing, his first taste of country music came through the records his dad played\u2014Johnny Horton, Johnny Cash, Buck Owens and Roy Clark. Kevin, of course, rebelled and gravitated more toward rockers AC/DC, Kiss, The Cars, Metallica, and other decidedly non-country bands. \\\"It wasn't 'til later on in life that I thought, 'that (country) stuff was really cool.'\\\"\\n\\nKevin recalls Amarillo as a good place to grow up, but entertainment options were, let's say, limited. That meant 16-year-old Kevin and some buddies might sneak a 6-pack of beer on a Friday night, head down the road a few miles to tiny Vega\u2014a town of under 1,000 people\u2014find an old dirt road and \\\"hide out.\\\" Let the good times roll!\\n\\nSo, was there a little culture shock when Kevin moved to California a few years later? \\\"It was like fallin' right off the turnip wagon,\\\" he laughs. \\\"I was in shock.\\\"\\n\\nThe move to L.A. came after Kevin, then a junior at West Texas A&M in Canyon, saw that life-changing show at the Cotton Bowl. With 100 credits toward a business degree, he quit school and went to the coast to study at the G.I.T guitar institute. While there, he learned how incredibly competitive the music world really is. So, was he intimidated?\\n\\n\\\"No. It was just an eye opener. My mama always persisted in telling me, 'Whatever you're gonna do, don't be a quitter.' That's why she never would let me quit piano music. Somebody told me one time, 'You've gotta stay in the game long enough to get lucky.'\\\"\\n\\nAfter finishing school in L.A., Kevin\u2014a road warrior at heart\u2014realized that paying gigs were few and far between in Los Angeles. \\\"That's the only reason I got into music . . . to play live,\\\" says Kevin, who'll do about 150 shows this year . . . slightly fewer than usual because of time spent writing and recording. So he left L.A. and tested the waters elsewhere. \\\"A friend lived in Austin. I was gonna go there, then I was gonna check out Nashville and figure out where I needed to be. When I got to Austin, that 5-day visit turned into a permanent stay. Been there ever since.\\\"\\n\\nNot long after his move to Austin, Kevin joined a band that became Rumble Train, but soon discovered he was the only with any motivation. Then he fell in with long-haired rockers Dangerous Toys (yep, short-haired, cowboy hat-wearing Kevin was in a hard rock band\u2014there's a rumor photos exist!). And, not surprisingly, they had a problem with Kevin's tunes. \\\"'Man, these are redneck songs! We can't play any of these.'\\\" So, in a move that was more necessity than intention, Kevin began singing them himself.\\n\\nAnd Kevin, the rocker who also wore out two cassettes of George Strait's Right or Wrong album, found a way to combine the best of both worlds. \\\"I've always liked rock, for the attitude and the energy. But I've always liked the country lyric. It just tells a story. And I try to combine those elements . . . make it rockin' and fun with a good lyric in there, a good turn of a phrase.\\\"\\n\\nThat ability has given Kevin more than a decade of success in his Texas stomping grounds where he is embraced with a vengeance by audiences who love him and his music. But he wants more.\\n\\n\\\"At first, my whole thing was to make a livin' playin.' 'Course, once you get that, you do want more. Right now, we're just tryin' to spread the gospel of Hank Williams and honky tonks to the rest of the world.\\\" But Kevin admits he's intent on doing that without alienating his strong, loyal fan base by changing his music or who he is. \\\"You gotta remember to dance with who brung ya.\\\"\\n\\nUltimately, Kevin knows he only has control over one thing in his career. \\\"What you do onstage . . . nobody can make you sound crappy but you. That's Kevin Fowler Music 101 in a nutshell. Make it about the fans, the live show and the music. And hopefully everything else will come from there.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-og.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/55/99/09-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":450,\"height\":300}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.kevinfowler.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/kevinfowler\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/KevinFowlerMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/kevinfowler\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"kevinfowler\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1365475?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
