It's a rare moment of pulling back the curtain, on both the excesses and tedium of the world of a touring musician, and it's the perfect way to open the Old 97's new album, 'Most Messed Up.'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I wrote that song very quickly and didn\u2019t rewrite one word of it,\\\" Miller explains.  \\\"It's sort of a thesis statement not just for this record, but for my life's work.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo say that rock and roll has been good to the Old 97's (guitarist/vocalist Miller, bassist/vocalist Murry Hammond, guitarist Ken Bethea, and drummer Philip Peeples) would be an understatement. The band emerged from Dallas twenty years ago at the forefront of a musical movement blending rootsy, country-influenced songwriting with punk rock energy and delivery. The New York Times has described their major label debut, 'Too Far To Care,' as \\\"a cornerstone of the 'alternative country' movement\u2026[that] leaned more toward the Clash than the Carter Family.\\\" They've released a slew of records since then, garnering praise from NPR and Billboard to SPIN and Rolling Stone, who hailed the band as \\\"four Texans raised on the Beatles and Johnny Cash in equal measures, whose shiny melodies, and fatalistic character studies, do their forefathers proud.\\\" The band performed on television from Letterman to Austin City Limits and had their music appear in countless film and TV soundtracks (they appeared as themselves in the Vince Vaughn/Jennifer Aniston movie 'The Break Up'). Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan told The Hollywood Reporter that he put the band on a continuous loop on his iPod while writing the show's final scene.\\r\\n\\r\\n'Most Messed Up' finds the Old 97's at their raucous, boozy best, all swagger and heart. Titles like \\\"Wasted,\\\" \\\"Intervention,\\\" \\\"Wheels Off,\\\" \\\"Let's Get Drunk And Get It On,\\\" and \\\"Most Messed Up\\\" hint at the kind of narrators Miller likes to inhabit, men who possess an appetite for indulgence and won't let a few bad decisions get in the way of a good story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"A few people in my life said, 'You can't sing 'Let's get drunk and get it on,'\\\" Miller remembers. \\\"I said, 'What do you mean? I've been singing that sentiment for 20 years! I was just never so straightforward about it.'\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a trip to Music City that inspired Miller to throw away his inhibitions as songwriter and cut right to the heart of things.\\r\\n\\\"For me, this record really started in Nashville on a co-write session with John McElroy,\\\" he says. \\\"I really admired his wheels off approach to songwriting, And I liked the idea he had for how he thought I should interact with my audience. He said, 'I think your fans want you to walk up to the mic and say fuck.' It was liberating.\\\" It reminded me that I don\u2019t have to be too serious or too sincere or heartfelt. I just have to have fun and be honest. I felt like I kind of had free reign to go ahead and write these songs that were bawdier and more adult-themed.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe magic in Miller's songwriting lies in the depth that he lends his characters. Upon closer inspection, the hard partying and endless pursuit of a good time often reveals itself to be a band-aid covering up deeper wounds and emotional scars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"There's a lot of darkness hidden in this record,\\\" he explains. \\\"One of the big Old 97's tricks is when we write about something kind of dark and depressing, it works best when it's a fun sounding song. So it's not until the third or fourth listen that you realize the narrator of this song is a complete disaster.\\\"\\r\\nIf that description calls to mind The Replacements, it's no coincidence. Miller is a fan of the Minneapolis cult heroes, and now counts Tommy Stinson among his own friends and fans. Best known as bassist for the Mats and more recently Guns 'n' Roses, Stinson joined the Old 97's in the studio in Austin, Texas, to lay down electric guitar on ## tracks, elevating the sense of reckless musical abandon to new heights and lending the album an air of the Rolling Stones' double-guitar attack. It's a collaboration Miller never would have even imagined in 1994 when the band released their debut.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We didn\u2019t think we'd last until the year 1997,\\\" Miller laughs. \\\"We thought the name would get a little weird when it became 1997, but we decided none of our bands had ever lasted that long, so let's not even worry about it. But as it all started to unfold, we realized we could maybe make a living doing this, and we were all really conscious of wanting to be a career band. It was way more important to us to maintain a really high level of quality, at the expense, perhaps, of having hit singles or fitting in with the trends of the time, and I'm glad we did that.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty years on, it's safe to say rock and roll has indeed been very, very good to the Old 97's.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":670,\"height\":446},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":670,\"height\":446},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-og.jpg\",\"width\":670,\"height\":446},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/32/30/69-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"j7-L7QmTo3A\",\"title\":\"Old 97's perform \\\"Won't Be Home\\\" LIVE on The Texas Music Scene\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7-L7QmTo3A\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"pBC0wI7i3Jk\",\"title\":\"\\\"Jesus Loves You\\\" Old 97's New Song!

When I look at the core of myself, my name is Luther and I'm a 68-year-old black guy with one green eye and a couple gold teeth and I play harmonica in a blues band that plays at a dump in the ghetto. Nobody comes to the gigs, and I'll have played there my whole life\u2014like, five days a week my band plays there. One night, Keith Richards is in town and he comes in and jams with me. Word gets around and someone recorded it and then that record gets released, and I die the day before it gets released. When it's released, it's the biggest blues hit since Stevie Ray Vaughan. On the inside, that's what I look like.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJustin Jones is \\\"rock and roll\u2026.No Auto-Tune, no gimmicks\u2014just a songwriter with a guitar and a crack band,\\\" says The Vinyl District's Jennifer Carney.  With a musical career that spans more than a decade, Virginia native Justin Jones is taking his soul-stirring brand of rock and roll on the road for his I Can Feel It Tour 2013 of the U.S.\\n\\nWeaned on the sounds of southern soul, blues, and rock, Jones started playing open mic nights in Charlottesville near his hometown in his early teens.  His first album, Blue Dreams \u2013 recorded in 2004, is the cornerstone of what turns out to be this prolific singer-songwriter's catalog of albums, including Love Versus Heroin, I Am the Song of the Drunkards, and The Little Fox, that express both the lows and highs of love and life.  \\\"The songs I write and the music my band and I play, in my mind, is quintessentially American\u2026 It lives and breathes in the landscape that is America\u2026 sometimes soulful and sometimes stark\u2026 sometimes hard and sometimes lush.  I like to think I write beautiful songs about death, sad songs about love, and hopeful songs about life.  What I consider a kind of secular spiritual music.\\\"  Fading Light, Justin's fifth album, was released in 2012.  Produced by Jamie Candiloro, best known for his work with Ryan Adams and R.E.M., Fading Light is a collection of songs written over a two-year stretch.\\n\\nJustin Jones is an American singer-songwriter. In addition to singing, he plays piano, guitar, and harmonica. His music has been described by the Washington Post as \\\"electrified country and roots-rock that leaves plenty of space for Jones to hold court...like Dave Grohl when at full throttle and Townes Van Zandt when at ease.\\\" He has toured North America extensively, and with a backing band that has sometimes been referred to as the Driving Rain. He is the first artist signed to 9:30 Records.\\nTalk to Justin once and you'll realize, as far as he's concerned, he's done it all.  \\n\\nThe B-Sides are:\\n\\nJohn \\\"scoops\\\" Hutchins (bass): John Scoops learned to play bass for church. He eats lots of ice cream and has been in too many DC and not DC bands to list. Currently he plays with Justin Jones in the The Deadmen and also with DC garage rockers Typefighter.\\nJohn used to be in a cult, actually he was the leader.  He left citing \\\"creative differences\\\" with 6 of his 37 wives.  He has 105 children and pays a whopping 483,000 pesos a month in child support. \\n\\nBobby Birdsong (pedal steel): Bobby Birdsong is an accompalished pedal steel guitarist who's played with every DMV Americana band of note.  \\nBirdsong loves shots of rail tequila and puppies.  \\n\\nBobby Thompson (guitar): Bobby has gained near legend status for his reputation as soulful singer, guitarist, and songwriter.  \\nBobby has an alter ego named El Paco and one day hopes to start a landscaping business.  \\n\\nRyan Walker (keys, vocals): Ryan Walker is the primary singer/songwriter behind The Beanstalk Library and the bassist/keyboardist in The Cowards Choir.  Both bands tour regularly and have records available.  More info at www.thebeanstalklibrary.com andwww.thecowardschoir.com\\nRyan has been at every local bands show, ever.  \\n\\nTim Felton (drums): A local native, Tim Felton has been playing drums since early childhood. A member of countless bands in the area, his experience over the years ranges from studio session work to live performance in a multitude of genres. With a heart of gold and an infectious presence, Tim strives for excellence and creativity in all his endeavors.\\nTim was once in a biker gang, but he's put those days behind him, we think.  \\n\\nSara Curtin (vocals): SARA CURTIN is an electric singer-songwriter from Washington, D.C. with a taste for confessional lyrics and velvety vocals. She is a 2014 & 2015 Artist Fellow (DC Commission on the Arts & Humanities) and has won 4 Washington Area Music Awards with her duo The Sweater Set. \\\"One of DC's finest\\\" - Brightest Young Things. www.saracurtin.com\\nSara actually hates sweaters. \\n\\nMargot MacDonald (vocals): Margot MacDonald embodies a one-woman band. A long time guitarist and pianist, Margot's instrumentation has expanded to include unconventional vocal accompaniments created live thru the use of a loop pedal.\\nMargot has been working on an all vocal, looped, orchestral piece she will only refer to as \\\"el diablo\\\".
