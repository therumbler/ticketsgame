The young guitarist reviving blues-rock.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2013 London Metro, UK\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Wales and raised in Toronto, Canada, Philip Sayce\u2019s love of the guitar started at an early age when his parents introduced him to all of the classics, notably, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jeff Beck. \u201cI have such distinct memories listening to these incredible musicians,\u201d Sayce says.  \u201cTheir music had a huge effect on me.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHis first live music experience was an Eric Clapton gig at Toronto\u2019s Maple Leaf Gardens.  \u201cThis groovy version of \u2018Crossroads\u2019 had such an impact on me,\u201d he recalls.  \u201cIt was that musicianship that laid the foundation for me.  What Clapton did was very different from what many younger artists do today.  It was about spilling your heart out.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that inspiration ingrained, Philip asked his parents for a guitar, which became his constant companion.  \u201cIt was this acoustic guitar from Sears with strings about four feet off the fret board,\u201d he laughs.  \u201cI broke every CD player, DVD player, and tape player in the house pushing pause and rewind trying to figure out how to play.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the age of sixteen, Philip started showing up and playing at blues jam nights at Grossman\u2019s Tavern in downtown Toronto.  It wasn\u2019t long before he was winning over admirers, including the legendary guitarist Jeff Healey, who invited Philip to join his band.  Over the next few years, Philip had his first international tour experience with Healey, playing prestigious festivals and stages worldwide. \u201cI learned so much from Jeff.  His playing was off the charts.  He would simply put people in a trance when he performed.  It was otherworldly.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a move to Los Angeles, Philip was invited to join Melissa Etheridge\u2019s band following an introduction by producer John Shanks.  For the next several years, Philip performed on Melissa Etheridge\u2019s albums and was featured during her live concerts where his cosmic performances left audiences stunned.  On one such occasion, Melissa and her band were honoring Bon Jovi at a Grammy Awards event.  Following the performance, Jon Bon Jovi told the audience \u201cI want to give a special nod to Philip, who I immediately opened the program and said \u2018Who the fuck is that guitar player?\u2019 Pretty fabulous Philip.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, Philip released Peace Machine, the first of three solo albums that established him as one of the leading lights in a new generation of blues-rock guitarists.  With each subsequent release (Ruby Electric and Steamroller) his reputation continued to grow.  With the European release of his fourth solo album, Influence, in the summer of 2014, Philip received some of the best reviews of his career.  Produced by Dave Cobb, Influence features songs by artists that have inspired Philip over the years, as well as several original compositions.  In January 2015, Philip signed with Warner Music Canada.  Two new recordings, produced by Michael Nielsen at Revolution Studios in Toronto, are included on the Canadian version of Influence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cInfluence is powerful enough to turn him in to Canada\u2019s next homegrown guitar hero.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2013 Toronto Sun\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cInfluence is a culmination of sounds, colors, emotions, and artists who have directly helped to shape my approach and love of music,\u201d said Philip.  \u201cThe intention of my own music is to continue the message, power, love, and inspiration that I experience in every artist that has influenced me.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album\u2019s first single, Ten Years After\u2019s \u201cI\u2019d Love To Change The World\u201d is a full illustration of what Philip is talking about.  \u201cIt\u2019s such an impactful song with a significant message,\u201d says Sayce.  \u201cIt is a chance to acknowledge Alvin Lee as one of the great guitarists of the past 100 years.  We didn\u2019t want to attempt to just re-create the original track.  Our intention is to honor its influence and to infuse the music with the energy of 2015.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOther covers on Influence included obscure gems like Little Richard\u2019s funky \u201cGreen Power\u201d, Graham Nash\u2019s gorgeous \u201cBetter Days\u201d and The Sonics\u2019 raucous \u201cI\u2019m Going Home\u201d.  \u201cThere are already some great covers out there of songs that might be more obvious,\u201d recalls Philip.  \u201cDave and I wanted to find songs that maybe not everybody knew, but spoke to where I was coming from musically.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the original songs on the album is the sonic masterpiece \u201cOut Of My Mind\u201d which is a clear tip of the hat to the man who changed modern blues guitar, Jimi Hendrix.  \u201cThe track is an homage to the master,\u201d admits Sayce.  \u201cHendrix really moved me at an early age.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moody \u201cFade Into You\u201d captures Philip\u2019s raw emotion.  \u201cThis could be the heaviest song on the album,\u201d he mentions quietly. \u201cIt comes from a very hurt, sad, dark place.  It\u2019s about being screwed over in the music business.\u201d  Conversely, the rocker \u201cLight \u2018Em Up\u201d is Philip encouraging people to empower themselves over the darkness and to keep pushing through.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201c\u2026a career-best record. Influence is worth the wait.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2013 Classic Rock Magazine, UK\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip\u2019s musical life hit a high point in 2013 with his unforgettable performance at Eric Clapton\u2019s Crossroads Festival at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden.  \u201cIt was a special experience that reinforced my love of music and commitment to honour the musical integrity of my heroes,\u201d Sayce says.  \u201cI\u2019m going out there in the studio and onstage to do my best and perform from my heart every time.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"true\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/47/31-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"9cp0SPEMAls\",\"title\":\"Philip Sayce - Out Of My Mind (Live at Q107)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cp0SPEMAls\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOgi3Arlgo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://philipsayce.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/PhilipSayceMusic/?fref=ts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/philipsayce\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"philipsayce\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1760981,\"name\":\"Skunkmello\",\"startTime\":\"2016-11-18 20:30:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"It's difficult to ascertain exactly when it happened, but what is now referred to as Skunkmello initially coalesced from primal street-slop into a potent brew of high-octane rock and roll in the typical manner: via a prolonged slog of sordid circumstances, brutal affairs, and high-proof late-night frenzies in the acrid warehouses that line the East River. Now, several soggy years down the road, the particular details are no longer important. It's vibrantly clear that after more than four years of late nights, lost shoes, and last calls, Skunkmello has become one New York City's hardest hitting and rowdy rock and roll bands \u2013 not from concentrate, and not for the faint of heart. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe band blends the raw urgency of Creedence Clearwater Revival with the singer-songwriter storytelling of counter-folk troubadour Towns Van Zandt and the sticky swagger of the Rolling Stones, celebrating the traditions of rock and roll with brazen irreverence. A Skunkmello live show is pure run and gun rocket-fire from the hip \u2013 a whiskey-addled sonic evolution of blues and folk heritage, deep on improvisation and flow. The studio catalogue is more eclectic in its influences but refined in its taste and decor, revealing a covert literary awareness while simultaneously reflecting a focus on craft and musicianship, achieved quite impressively despite the crazed depravity of the scene from which it emerges. \\r\\n\\r\\nItinerant drifters and zig-zag wanderers by nature, there is a certain vagrant appeal to the band's sound that is especially apparent when they take the circus on the road. Careening on the edge of certain doom is when the Skunkmello sound truly rumbles to life in all its dynamic complexity, and it's often through sheer determination and white-knuckled grit that they're able to scoot that double yellow line and avoid those ambulances night after night. From the burning sun in Barstow to the cold in Somerville, the band are routine outlaws at music festivals such as SXSW, CMJ, and Musikfest while gracing countless and far-flung stages, barrooms, farmhouses, street-corners, garages, rooftops, back-alleys and basements with their villainous virtuosity along the way.
