Simple, down home, charming, country-boys with immeasurable talent that was destined to take them straight to the top. The band was signed by A&R wizard Jason Flom to Capitol records and their first single, \\\"Addicted\\\" did just that, reaching number one on several charts and the follow-up singles \\\"18 Days\\\" and \\\"Drowning\\\" helped sell over 750,000 copies of their debut album. They toured heavily in support of this album, playing with Buckcherry and Avenged Sevenfold, and later on Nickelback, in arenas across North America. Night after night, the boys would go back to the bus with their ears ringing from 15,000 fans screaming their lyrics.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowing that they would need something great to follow up with, the boys set out to write their sophomore album on Capitol, \\\"Miss America.\\\" Topping the Active Rock and Hard Rock charts yet again with \\\"Sex is Good\\\" and \\\"Stupid Girl\\\" solidified Saving Abel's place both on the radio and live. Setting out on their own tour this time, Saving Abel headlined theaters around the country for almost 2 years non-stop. They toured with several artists and made a lot of friends along the way, but always kept their focus on the fans, and their eyes toward the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nJason Flom left Capitol and the band did as well. The band signed to a new major label and the band didn't want to fall into a rut of making the third album sound like the first two, Saving Abel returned to their Mississippi origin, adding a depth and soul that could only come from their country roots. Using banjos, mandolins, and a healthy helping of moonshine, Saving Abel went into the studio with a mission to stick with \\\"what they know best,\\\" and wrote an emotional, soulful record that was still rooted in rock-n-roll, but highlighted their classic country roots. Listening to \\\"Bringing Down The Giant\\\" was as reminiscent of Hank Williams as it was of Elvis Presley. In hindsight the album was probably a little self-indulgent and while songs like \\\"Constantly\\\" and \\\"Pictures of Elvis\\\" highlighted their softer side and amazing song writing ability, the label and band had creative differences over what to release as a first single and the label won, the result being a mildly successful rollout and the label all but abandoned the band, leaving them in the unusual predicament of not knowing what to do next.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next steps were difficult and profound but in the end proved liberating on numerous levels. First the band parted ways with their label and publishing company, those splits were followed by a split with their management, business management and booking agent. The band then hired former Creed, Sevendust, and Paramore manager and Silent Majority Group / ADA label president Jeff Hanson. Hanson brought in new lead singer Scotty Austin and new drummer Steven Pulley, a new booking agent, fan relations manager, business manager, merch company, and radio promotion team and finally enlisted a new producer, former 12 Stones guitarist and songwriter Justin Rimer. \\\"Bringing in new faces wasn't done because we were unhappy with the previous team's performance, I just felt like we should surround ourselves with people who wouldn't be disappointed if we didn't have a gold or platinum record. Those are benchmarks that are much more difficult to achieve than they were 5 years ago and are honestly unrealistic expectations for anyone.\\\" Says Hanson. Hanson then helped the band form their own label in order to move forward on their own terms. The new label was named Tennessippi Whiskey Records based on the fact that the all of the members of the band are from Tennessee and Mississippi and are known for their moderate but very public Jack Daniels consumption Ditching the tour bus and getting back in a van in order to afford the recording of a new record on off days from their perpetual tour, along with a renewed focus on their live performances and spending time in person and on the internet with their fans, the band saw a resurgence in fan attendance at shows and the number of people following the band on their social media sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the addition of new members Scotty Austin and Steven Pulley to the existing core of Saving Abel Jason Null, Scott Bartlett, and Eric Taylor, the result of this new lineup and independent attitude of the band has been amazing. \\\"There is so much excitement being generated on a nightly basis by the fans based on their love of Scotty Austin, it makes it seem like it is 2008 again and we are about to blow up again, and I can't believe this level of excitement exists all over again\\\" says founding member and guitarist Jason Null. Null also goes on to say\u2026 \\\"Scotty has an autistic child, and seeing the sacrifices he makes every day to make a life for his son makes it a lot easier for me to get back in a van and play smaller venues without complaining after I spent years in arenas on a bus, him being here really has changed the way all of us view what we do.\\\" Scotty Austin\u2026 \\\"I spent years playing cover gigs, singing 4 hours a night, this is literally a dream come true for me. Playing every night to fans that came to hear and sing along to songs that these guys and I wrote, I could never get tired of it. It also gives me a small platform to try to draw awareness to Autism, if nothing more comes of this than to make my son's life just a tiny bit better, it will have been worth it. I can't thank these guys enough for giving me this chance.\\\" Steven Pulley\u2026 \\\"Scotty and I literally quit our day jobs the day we were called about being in this band. We were blown away that a nationally recognized band like Saving Abel, who could have gotten any players in America to replace their leaving members, would actually prefer to have a couple of guys like us mainly because we were guys from a small town (Jackson, TN) with big dreams. We basically left home, went on the road, and loved every minute since. Knowing what's coming on this record, we are definitely living a dream.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new songs from their forthcoming album Blood Stained Revolution mirror the new energy and attitude of the band. The songs themselves are mostly uptempo and upbeat and pay homage to all of the bands we love, Guns and Roses, Tool, and The Allman Brothers. The album is absolutely a continuation of founding member Jason Null's mainstream southern rock hit writing abilities but with an amazing added energy similar to that of Mick Jagger or Scott Weiland being provided by Scotty Austin. The band is also eager to note that the new album is the first album on which all of the band members were able to participate in the creative process. On the first three albums the creative process was partially controlled by outside factors but on this album it seemed as though the floodgates were open because there were no limitations or interferences and everyone in the band was asked to contribute the ideas that had been percolating among the members for years that they hadn't always been able to share. Jeff Hanson says\u2026 \\\" I am a huge southern rock fan and Scott Bartlett's solo album and the Trash the Brand album, Scotty Austin and Steven Pulley's previous band together, are two of my favorite albums, so having them contribute to the song writing on this album has made a huge difference and in my mind sets it apart from previous Saving Abel records. The fact that there were no time constraints this time and the record was basically written on the road seems to have allowed the band to write when they wanted to as opposed to writing when they had to. It's fun not forced.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe upcoming release will be released on November 11, the date was aptly chosen because by the band because it is Veteran's Day. Individually and collectively Saving Abel and its members have always been incredible supporters of the amazing men and women in the US Armed Forces. \\\"18 Days,\\\" \\\"Drowning\\\", and \\\"Miss America\\\" were all written and dedicated to the US Military. Since 2009, Saving Abel has had the honor of being invited and traveling to play for the troops in some of the most remote and dangerous places in the world. \u2026Iraq, Qatar, Cuba, Japan, and India just to name a few. No matter where they are or what they are doing, no matter if it's 5 minutes to show time, the boys in Saving Abel will ALWAYS stop what they are doing to acknowledge and thank a Soldier, Sailor, Airman or Marine. Scott Bartlett states \\\" It's amazing that we now feel unencumbered by the confines of the traditional music business to the point that we can release our album on a date of our choosing, We were actually told that we were crazy to be releasing a new record in the 4th quarter, but it is actually a statement for us, to release this album on our own terms, when we want and how we want. At the end of the day all that matters is our music and our fans and what time of year it is isn't really a part of that equation. We're celebrating Veteran's Day with a new record and that's awesome!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSaving Abel has no plans to slow down and has dates booked into 2015 and further. The band is still in the van and is starting a \\\"Pledge Music\\\" campaign to try to auction off some unique and special VIP experiences in order to be able to get back in a bus again. With the pre sale of the new album, the band will be offering additional add on packages that include fishing and BBQs with the band, guitar lessons, and to allowing fans to perform on their next record.\\\" It's all about finding that balance between enjoying your fans, family and friends and having a business that allows you to play music for a living, if we can go fishing and have meals with our fans and it helps us be able to stay on the road, we're all for that, hopefully we can do this forever\\\" says bassist Eric Taylor.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":639},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":639},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/06/53-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.savingabel.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/savingabel\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/savingabel\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/savingabel\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"savingabel\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1533995,\"name\":\"Up From Ashes\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1371005?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
