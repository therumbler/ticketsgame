Her  hit single \u201cEx\u2019s & Oh\u2019s\u201d was nominated for 2 Grammys and 2 Billboard Music Awards, was certified double platinum, and she made chart history, becoming the second female artist in 18 years to reach #1 at Alternative Radio, following Lorde\u2019s #1 with \u201cRoyals\u201d in 2013.  Her single also claimed the #1 spot on the AAA Chart, #1 at Hot AC, and #1 spot on the Billboard \u201cHot Rock Songs\u201d with \u201cEx's & Oh's, becoming the 4th female led act/artist to top this chart in its 6 year history. Elle recently released the video for her new single \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweetheart\u201d and performed  Sweetheart on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and The Late Late Show with James Corden. Elle will be the opening act on several dates this fall for The Dixie Chicks.  She has received much critical acclaim -- Jon Pareles of The New York Times described her as \u201ca sassy, hard-drinking, love-\u2019em-and-leave-\u2019em hellion with bad tattoos and a broad pedigree across rock, pop and country. She has Adele\u2019s determination and Joan Jett\u2019s stomp, Brenda Lee\u2019s high-voiced bite and some AC/DC shriek.\\\"  Elle has been featured by The Wall Street Journal, Teen Vogue, People.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.elleking.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/ElleKingMusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ElleKingMusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ElleKingMusic\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1763541,\"name\":\"Paul Cauthen\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"<iframe width=\\\"450\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zT4jDn4e9lg\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Cauthen remembers sitting alone in an Austin house after a weekend-long bender. A life making music seemed to be slipping away. Wide awake with nothing to lose, he fell on his hands and knees right there, bowed his head, and threw down a divine gauntlet.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cI dared Him,\u201d Cauthen says, recalling his desperate challenge to God. \u201cI said, \u2018Use me. I\u2019ll be a rag doll. Just put me out there, let\u2019s go. I dare you.\u2019\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nMost people don't plead in the form of a dare. That blend of vulnerability and brash confidence is part of what makes Cauthen and his music\u2013\u2013which often hinges on the same paradox\u2013\u2013so compelling. Whether it was by heavenly intervention or sheer force of will, Cauthen emerged with My Gospel (Lightning Rod Records), his mesmerizing full-length solo debut. Produced by Beau Bedford, the record is both an artistic and personal triumph. My Gospel captures a young artist in full possession of a raw virtuosity that must sometimes feel like a burden: If your singing takes listeners on white-knuckle rides and you write like a hard-luck Transcendentalist poet who abandoned the East Coast for the desert, you\u2019d better do both. Anything else just wouldn\u2019t feel like living. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else I\u2019m supposed to do in life,\u201d Cauthen says. \u201cSo I just kept on working. Even when I didn\u2019t hardly have money to eat, my songs allowed me to get into the studios. I wrote my way into this thing.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nThe album is called My Gospel, but make no mistake: These are songs about Earthly struggles to love, connect, and just get by. \u201cI\u2019m not super religious,\u201d Cauthen says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe God is this guy wearing a white cloak who comes down with wings and beautiful sandals. I do believe that people are put into other people\u2019s lives for reasons, and those reasons are unexplained. I believe that is God.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nAmericana music fans will remember Cauthen\u2019s name from Sons of Fathers, the raucous Texicana group he co-founded in 2011 with bassist David Beck. The band earned glowing praise from Rolling Stone, NPR, and others, thanks to two albums that climbed into the Top 10 of the Americana Music Chart. \u201cWe had just played a show with Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes, playing for 7,000 people,\u201d Cauthen says. \u201cAnd I quit. I just knew it wasn\u2019t where I was supposed to be anymore.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nThat was three years ago\u2013\u2013and the impetus for ending up in that apartment in Austin. Cauthen has since learned to channel his racing mind and rumbling baritone into the blues, gospel, and rock-and-roll that fuel My Gospel with gale-force power. Over the course of three years, Cauthen recorded the album in several different studios across the country: Willie Nelson\u2019s Arlyn Studios in Austin; FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals; Sargent Recorders in Los Angeles; Modern Electric Sound Recorders in Dallas. The result is a quintessentially American album unlike anything in recent memory. \u201cWe were going for timeless. We were going for righteous. Those were the two words that we focused on while we were recording,\u201d Cauthen says. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nCauthen has been the strongest, loudest singer in the room for as long as he can remember. He grew up in Tyler, Texas, where his grandfather\u2013\u2013a songwriter and gospel song leader originally from Lubbock who worked with artists including Buddy Holly, Sonny Curtis, and other Crickets\u2013\u2013taught Cauthen and his two sisters to sing harmony. \u201cHe threw us all in the bathtub because it sounded really good in there,\u201d Cauthen says with a laugh. Sundays and Wednesday evenings were spent at the Church of Christ, singing a cappella in the choir. \u201cMy granddad was all about music. He\u2019d always ask people, \u2018Can you sing? What songs do you know?\u2019\u201d Cauthen lovingly imitates his grandfather as he shares the memory, changing his inflection to sound both excited and earnest.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen his grandfather died, Cauthen was 10 years old and heartbroken. He abandoned the guitar he\u2019d taught him to play. \u201cIt made me too sad,\u201d he says simply. But his grandmother pushed him to pick it up again, and she handed over his grandfather\u2019s \u201958 Gibson acoustic along with Willie Nelson\u2019s Red Headed Stranger as she told him, \u201cLearn every bit of Willie\u2019s licks. Then you\u2019ll be a guitar player.\u201d She also put plenty of Elvis, Roy Orbison, Waylon Jennings, the Everly Brothers, and more in his hands.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs a teenager, Cauthen got into more trouble than most. He got caught with weed and did a little time in jail, then got kicked out of college. \u201cYou have to get kicked out of something in order to be a true songwriter, whether it\u2019s kicked out of school, or kicked out of your house, or kicked out of a marriage, or kicked into jail,\u201d Cauthen says, only half-joking. \u201cI got all those on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d He started working in oil and natural gas to make ends meet, surveying land and enjoying being outside. But all the while, he never stopped singing.\\r\\n \\r\\nCauthen delivers the songs on My Gospel with the tortured showmanship of Jerry Lee Lewis and seductive ease of Elvis. The idea of a life-affirming power found in the connectedness of people courses throughout the record. The album kicks off with \u201cStill Drivin\u2019,\u201d which calls up the swampy finger-picking of Jerry Reed as it proclaims survival. \u201cIt\u2019s my don\u2019t-give-up anthem,\u201d Cauthen says. \u201cKeep on truckin\u2019.\u201d As he thunders, \u201cStill drivin\u2019 / when\u2019s this break gonna come?\u201d the word \u201cbreak\u201d points to both a career breakthrough and the universal need for rest. \u201cI love to leave the plots of songs open-ended,\u201d he says, enjoying the different possibilities for interpretation the track allows.\\r\\n \\r\\nCauthen co-wrote all of the songs on the album with his motley crew of \u201cfavorite songwriting buddies\u201d save two, \u201cI\u2019ll Be the One\u201d and \u201cGrand Central,\u201d which he wrote alone. As Cauthen begs for a chance in \u201cI\u2019ll Be the One,\u201d he swivels between cocky self-assurance and humble beseeching, crooning, \u201cOh, I could be your kind of guy / whatever that is, cold, sweet, shy.\u201d It\u2019s a signature Cauthen vocal performance: playful but also masterful. \u201cGrand Central\u201d uses crying steel to capture the loneliness of rock bottom. Written in about seven minutes not long after he left Sons of Fathers, the song offers a moving portrait of a man who\u2019s running out of options but remains proud as he mulls over self-inflicted wounds, confessing, \u201cThe only one that\u2019s hurting is me.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cYou\u2019re as Young as You\u2019ll Ever Be\u201d has assumed deep personal significance for Cauthen. He wrote the song with his dear friend Victor Holk just four months before Holk died after suffering third-degree burns in a house fire. Holk, who was a sound engineer for Sons of Fathers and Cheatham Street Warehouse in San Marcos, came to Cauthen with the line that became the song\u2019s title and heart. The two had never written together before. \u201cIt\u2019s a haunting song for me. I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Cauthen trails off, then adds, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to play. It\u2019s a song I\u2019m blessed with because Victor was a selfless human being that was all for music and the arts.\u201d The track is one of several on the album that urges listeners to seize the day. Smoldering, piano-laced \u201cLet It Burn\u201d lingers in regrets and memories as it elevates the seemingly mundane. \u201cI\u2019m just really trying to put somebody into a place where they can take it all in and totally comprehend what happens around them,\u201d he says. \u201cThese little moments that we have with somebody that were super beautiful that we take for granted.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nThe sauntering \u201cMy Saddle\u201d utilizes guitar, horns, percussive shakers, lush background harmonies, wolf howls, and Cauthen\u2019s vocal prowess to conjure up imagery fit for a John Ford film\u2013\u2013and sweep his target off her feet. The American West is one of the ever-present undercurrents on My Gospel: \u201cMarfa Lights\u201d compares a romance to the famous, sporadic heavenly light show in West Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s a mysterious, cosmic love song,\u201d Cauthen says.\\r\\n \\r\\nCauthen soars when he explores that conflicted space of crying out for help and demanding it. \u201cHanging Out On the Line\u201d is one of the most stunning examples, enriched by gospel harmonies courtesy of Muscle Shoals veterans who contributed to landmark Aretha Franklin and Etta James albums. The same gorgeous harmonies flood the title track, which also serves as the album\u2019s show-stopping closer. Cauthen launches into \u201cMy Gospel\u201d starkly alone before being joined by the otherwordly chorus. Started with Owen Temple and finished in Muscle Shoals with Bedford and guitar player, Nik Lee, the song is a tender acknowledgement of weariness and an invitation to rest in truth, sung with empathy and love. \u201cYou have to give up everything, forfeit yourself to the situation, and hope to God that your talents are good enough,\u201d Cauthen says of the recording process. \u201cThat\u2019s how great records are made.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nUltimately, Cauthen is on a mission: to make music he can be proud of that also serves a higher purpose. \u201cOn this album, I wanted to push a message that tells people that life\u2019s short. Love the ones you\u2019re with. Just take any opportunity to run with it\u2013\u2013don\u2019t think twice.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":641},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-og.jpg\",\"width\":1600,\"height\":1068},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/60/96-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.paulcauthenmusic.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/cauthenmusic/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/CauthenMusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"CauthenMusic\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1213619?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
