wake up cotton-mouthed, feverish and naked wrapped in a shower curtain as you lay in the fetal position inside of a bathtub knowing you probably did some morally questionable things while simultaneously wondering where the hell your girlfriend is at? She probably went home with Borgore after the club last night. Epitomizing the hashtag #NoFucksGiven, the Israeli-born master of musical mayhem, government name Asaf Borger, has been ravaging electronic culture one bass-heavy, booty-clapping bonanza at a time. \\r\\n\\r\\nHis decade-long scroll of accomplishments include heading up his own successful label, Buygore Records, headlining sold out shows to record-breaking crowds at iconic events such as Tomorrowland, Made In America, Ultra and EDC Las Vegas, a weekly internationally syndicated SiriusXM radio series 'The Borgore Show', and a milieu of collaborative bangers alongside fellow ratchet cohorts like Miley Cyrus, Waka Flocka Flame and Diplo. Hailed as one of the most mind-melting dubstep artists of his generation, the 27-year-old classically trained producer, song writer, and DJ's sonic evolution has been as enticing as his surreal multi-sensory show productions. As a fearless boundary buster, Borgore has deconstructed the stereotype of what a musician should be by blending his bass, trance, hip hop and dubstep influences with his compositional education from Tel Aviv's world renowned Thelma Yellin music academy. Unlike most electronic acts whose stagnant big room sounds barely make it past the press release abyss, Asaf's initial standout releases like 2009's Ice Cream Mixtape and 2010'sBorgore Ruined Dubstep, Pt. 1 & Pt. 2, made him an early frontrunner in the dubstep scene. \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore he made \\\"bitches love cake\\\", Borgore's head banging bass inspiration happened one night in his hometown at an indie nightclub after seeing hardstyle acts Skream, Benga, Mala and Coki perform, encouraging Asaf to make his own divergent sound he could then push online and departing from his former Israeli deathcore band Shabira. As clicks and play counts far exceeded expectations sooner than imaginable, Borgore became Internet culture's one to watch attracting more attention than his already established peers. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith booming traction and an ever-growing fan base, it seemed only fitting for music's biggest names to commission his talents. Borgore's standout remixes include Britney Spears' \\\"Womanizer\\\", Passion Pit's \\\"Sleepyhead\\\", M.I.A.'s \\\"Illygirl\\\", Cedric Gervais' \\\"Molly\\\", Metallica's \\\"Master of Puppets\\\" and O.T. Genasis's Billboard Top 20 pop culture smash \\\"Coco\\\". After seven years of bold artistic audacity captivating fans and industry peers alike, it was time for a #NEWGOREORDER with the release of his debut album in 2014. Overall rave reviews from critics of his \\\"collection of menacing tracks\\\" (Dancing Astronaut) solidified Borgore as a force to be reckoned with in electronic culture. Being so entrenched in and exposed to the tantalizing glamor of the Hollywood lifestyle, Borgore's unfiltered persona bleeds through not only his eargasmic creations and non-stop party music videos but his honest representation as a no-holds-barred artist.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile art imitates real life for Borgore creatively, he's tackled his duty as a celebrity by affecting positive change in the community that has supported him. His philanthropic efforts with electronic music lifestyle brand Electric Family have helped raise awareness for breast cancer charity Keep a Breast Foundation. Here Asaf helped produce collaboration bracelets with 100% of the proceeds benefitting the program's research towards eradication and promotion of breast cancer awareness among youth in the EDM scene. \\r\\n\\r\\nLike any artist with a widely recognized household name, Borgore remains self-intuitive and motivated to not keep up with what's happening now but to pioneer what audiences don't even know they like yet. After countless accolades and globe-trotting memories, this next step in Borgore's career will see him move away from the trap and dubstep vibes fans are used to as he delves more heavily into breeding a new variation within hip hop. In a recent interview withMiami New Times, Borgore best explains his trajectory of growth as a culmination of passion and new direction: \\\"We've been working on an EP, me and some of my favorite rappers\u2026I want to write songs rather than write bangers. I want to be true to myself as an artist and create the music I want to create.\\\"From death metal to dubstep to hip hop, regardless of any artistic changes Borgore intends to implement fans can rest assured that his production efforts will continue to lead the charge with the same high energy, potty mouth charisma that continues to resonate with so many. Stay tuned for forthcoming mass destruction.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":635},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":198},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":198},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":132},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":132},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-og.jpg\",\"width\":1548,\"height\":1024},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":66},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":331},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":331},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":430},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/01/37-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":430}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://therealborgore.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/borgore\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/Borgore\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Borgore\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Borgore\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1669371,\"name\":\"JayCeeOh\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Jake Osher, more popularly known as Jayceeoh, is a Los Angeles based Producer/DJ, world renowned turntablist, with genre focus on Trap, Twerk, and Electro in his original production and remixes.
