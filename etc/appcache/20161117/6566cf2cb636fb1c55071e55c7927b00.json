Jennings\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"When you hear about the son of two country music legends, the product seems inevitable\u2026\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what you get from Shooter Jennings is a little bit of that, and a whole lot of what you didn't realize you wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nA musician, song writer, producer, and video game creator, Jennings has released eight studio albums, two live records, and has produced and released various projects courtesy of his own record label Black Country Rock. Jennings\u2019 career hasn't ever stuck to one format, and you can find him all over the map when it comes to where he is at in the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis latest album, released in 2016, Countach (For Giorgio), came in at #7 on the US Dance/Electronic charts, and was Jennings\u2019 ode to electronic music innovator and songwriter, Giorgio Moroder. The album features songs with various artists including Marilyn Manson, Brandi Carlile, and Steve Young.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his 2005 debut solo record, Put The O Back In Country, Jennings enlisted Dave Cobb as producer (who remained producer on his first four solo records) and the album included southern rock tracks \u201c4th Of July\u201d and \u201cSteady At The Wheel\u201d. The record debuted at #22 on the US Country chart.\\r\\n\\r\\nFast forward to 2010, and you\u2019ll find Jennings releasing Black Ribbons, a heavy, psychedeliccountry-rock concept album that included narration from Stephen King as the album\u2019s character Will O\u2019 The Wisp. At the time, the album was a left turn for Jennings, but created a new path for fans of all genres, and somewhat of a cult-following of the record. Black Ribbons will be re-released on November 8th, 2016 (Election Day) as an \u201cUltimate Edition.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some stay in the safe-place of their genres, Jennings continues to place himself where he wants to be, and creates exactly what he feels is needed for the time.

But in a lot of ways, it\u2019s even more admirable when an artist has no need to do that \u2013 having never lost touch with those roots in the first place. Jason Boland falls squarely into the latter category, having spent the better part of the last 15 years entrenching himself in the so-called \u201cred dirt\u201d of his native state of Oklahoma and adopted home in Texas and while spreading his musical branches to cover a remarkable amount of territory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought it was important to keep one foot in tradition and the other pointed in the direction you want to go,\u201d says Boland. \u201cI didn\u2019t invent the G chord, so I\u2019m standing on the shoulders of the giants that did, and on the shoulders of some great songwriters that have come before me. I\u2019m using an old stencil, but adding my own colors.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn their new studio album, Dark and Dirty Mile, Boland and his compatriots use a wide array of hues to illustrate 11 songs of rejection and redemption, dark clouds and silver linings, all assembled in the rough-hewn manner that\u2019s earned him an ever-growing fan base \u2013 a following that\u2019s snapped up more than a half-million records over the past decade and change.\\r\\n\\r\\nDark and Dirty Mile is a song cycle of sorts, one that finds Boland seeking \u2013 and finding -- beauty in life\u2019s often-overlooked places, learning tough lessons through experience and overcoming obstacles with the help of others. That\u2019s evident in the title track, which opens the album with a vividly drawn emotional landscape strewn with moments of regret and missed opportunities \u2013 but a clear bead on a clear horizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nA similar dichotomy rolls through \u201cElectric Bill,\u201d a slow burn of a honky-tonk tune that conjures a picture of a man with an overdrawn checkbook in one hand and the hand of a loved one in the other \u2013 a sentiment he credits to his wife, who he says, reminded him that, \u201cif everything is taken away tomorrow, there\u2019s still love and hope in the world.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoland presents that sentiment without a drop of Hallmark saccharine, however. He doesn\u2019t sweeten these tunes with easy studio tricks or the sort of pop trickery so often heard on Music City productions these days. The surface is anything but slick, and the sinew that runs through songs like the organ-tinged strut \u201cGreen Screen\u201d and the high lonesome desert tone of his take on Randy Crouch\u2019s \u201cThey Took It Away\u201d lends a tone that\u2019s ragged-but-right, ideal for Boland\u2019s always-incisive lyrics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t always expect to have a lot there in terms of lyrics,\u201d he says. \u201cSociety says \u2018if it sounds like this, you have to do songs about that.\u2019 But if you just try to fit things together in the most simple way possible, you\u2019re just trying to manipulate people, and I\u2019m not interested in doing that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI think of myself as being in the Oklahoma tradition in the same way as Woody Guthrie \u2013 those of us who came up in Tornado Alley can all trace our lineage back to Woody.\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoland has been mining that territory for pretty much his entire career. Bowing in 1999 with the regionally popular Pearl Snaps \u2013 a first teaming with Lloyd Maines, who Boland cites as one of several seminal influences on his sonic vision \u2013 the Stragglers built a rabid following from the Panhandle to the Gulf Coast. Over the intervening half-decade, the band would team with similar kindred spirits \u2013 from Billy Joe Shaver to Dwight Yoakam compadre Pete Anderson to the late Bob Childers \u2013 to create an uncompromising body of work, as whip-smart as it is body-moving.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been lucky enough to work with people who feel the same way we do about things,\u201d says Boland. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t always make sense, but you meet people around the campfires who will be there for you. That\u2019s the big secret, 99 percent of people will share and break bread with you when times are hard.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoland himself says that he started to figure things out in earnest around the time he and the Stragglers went into the studio to record 2008\u2019s Comal County Blue, a set that, as Country Weekly put it, \u201cvividly chronicle the thoughts of a regular guy trying to make sense of the world and only occasionally succeeding, while keeping one eye on the reasons he keeps trying.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat disc brought Boland\u2019s songs to a wider audience than anything he\u2019d done in the past, but the momentum was slowed a bit by his need to take several months off to recover from surgery to remove a polyp from his vocal cord. He took the setback in stride, and now says, in retrospect, \u201cit was a good thing in some ways, since it helped teach me to really sing and broke me of the habit of yelling \u2013 which is an easy habit to develop if you come up singing in Texas honky-tonks.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time 2011\u2019s \u201cpalpably redemptive\u201d Rancho Alto (to quote the Austin Chronicle) came around, Boland had a firm rein on his instrument, which had grown into a burnished, evocative baritone, and further honed his pensive-but-not-pedantic writing style \u2013 all of which comes to heady fruition on the Shooter Jennings-produced Dark and Dirty Mile.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the steeliness of \u201cOnly One,\u201d with its unflagging belief in love in the face of adversity to the wistful regret of the album closing \u201cSee You When I See You,\u201d that strength shines through. It emerges in the two-step friendly rhythms of \u201cNine Times Out of Ten\u201d and it burrows deep into the soil on the soulful swing of \u201cLucky I Guess\u201d \u2013 songs that evoke the sight, smell and taste of the red dirt of his home territory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe t-shirt sellers love that phrase \u2018red dirt,\u2019 because it\u2019s so simple,\u201d says Boland. \u201cBut it fits. It was coined by the people making the music \u2013 rust in the ground, blood in the dirt. It\u2019s real and it\u2019s where I come from \u2013 and what I refuse to give up, no matter what.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":870},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":272},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":181},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-og.jpg\",\"width\":1779,\"height\":1612},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":91},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":453},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":589},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/71/89-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.thestragglers.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/jasonbolandthestragglers\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/Jason-Boland-The-Stragglers-112540055479124\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/BolandStraggler\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"BolandStraggler\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.worldcafelive.com/event/1323497?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
