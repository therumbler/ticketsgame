Welch\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Before we go any further, before we address anything, I\u2019d like you to forget. Maybe forget what Gillian Welch shows you\u2019ve seen, the floorboards all sparking from the weight of these two souls, Gill and Dave, and their four collective cowboy-booted soles; maybe forget when you first heard \u201cOrphan Girl,\u201d that song that seemed to exist outside of time and caused everyone who heard it to become the itinerant, the loner, the longing; maybe forget the years that have passed when last a new Gillian Welch record graced the hi-fi\u2019s of the music-listening world \u2013 forget the pop stars risen and erased in those years, the administrations and regimes born and gone in those years \u2013 forget, indeed, that there are eight of them, eight years, since Soul Journey arrived into the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Harrow & The Harvest, Gill and Dave\u2019s new record, is both a product of and is unrelated to those years in-between. Best to forget that. What it is, indisputably, is the product of two people who have become so entwined in one another that the songs and the singing and the playing on this record seems to exude from a single voice. This is the sound of two people in a room, playing to one another, with one another. This is the sound of the room in which the two people are playing. This is the sound of two voices, locked in unison, locked in harmony. The sound of two people playing live, with no overdubs, and very few takes. Two people making music together as if they were one soul combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow back up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is what we know: Gill and Dave met at Berklee College of Music; Gillian was studying songwriting, while Dave studied guitar; they met at an audition for a country band. Together, they moved to Nashville, TN where most of their work together has been produced. Since then they have influenced and inspired new generations of country and folk singers, songwriters and players. They have earned the slavish admiration of many of the most lauded and loved voices of the Americana milieu now living \u2013 and some who have since deceased (rest their souls). They\u2019ve had their songs recorded by the likes of Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, and Solomon Burke. Gill and Dave\u2019s body of work is deeply rooted in the world it has sought to portray in song: the American South.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cYes, Tennessee figures rather prominently in the new songs,\u201d says Gillian. The record, however, has little of the sweet sunny south; in fact, there\u2019s a real dark pallor to the thing \u2013 and the language in the songs seems to recall the shady groves of Tennessee far more than anything that the duet has done in recent memory. \u201cThe truth is, we absented ourselves from Nashville for a while, to escape the weight of home and studio and record label. But I think our thoughts turned back there with a newness and clarity I hadn\u2019t felt since I moved there almost 20 years ago.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the record they\u2019ve made, tonally, is a new Southern sound, with the sort of songs you wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear issuing from some verdant, wooded hollow in Appalachia; the sort of songs you\u2019d expect to be sung to soothe unquiet babies. Songs you\u2019d expect to hear hollered from an Asheville grange hall, all too late in the evening. Songs with the wry humor of the back porch. \u201cDave says this record is \u2018ten different kinds of sad\u2019, but it\u2019s not without humor. I feel like there\u2019s a maturity in it and a sense of place that only comes with time.\u201d Gillian continues, \u201cWe feel at home in the folk tradition, and using its language combined with our own.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of the folk tradition,\u201d laughs Dave.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the language is gorgeous.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the song \u201cTennessee\u201d:\\r\\n\\r\\nI kissed you cause I\u2019ve never been an angel\\r\\nI learned to say hosannas on my knees\\r\\nBut they threw me out of Sunday school when I was nine\\r\\nAnd the sisters said I did just as I pleased\\r\\nEven so I try to be a good girl\\r\\nIt\u2019s only what I want that makes me weak\\r\\nI had no desire to be a child of sin\\r\\nThen you went and pressed your whiskers to my cheek\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thing is, the two of them, Gill and Dave, have arrived at a place in their music where it seems to be impossible to attribute those words to one or the other. That\u2019s what I mean about their mindmeld. It\u2019s not just them performing and playing and singing together that is so uncanny, so wholly of one voice \u2013 the songwriting itself seems to have arrived at a similar apotheosis. \u201cAs a songwriting team,\u201d says Dave, \u201cwe are more seamless and fluid than ever before. It\u2019s nearly impossible to unravel who wrote what word, what line, what sentiment.\u201d Gillian adds: \u201cIt\u2019s truly immaterial at this point. When Dave and I really get down to work, it\u2019s like we\u2019re in a lifeboat, like we\u2019re the only two people in the world, and it is very quiet. I think some of that quietness comes through on these recordings.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nListen to this record with the lights low. Listen to it on an old radio, cradled next to your ear. This is the sound of two people, singing and playing their songs. Forget the years in between.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe way you made it\\r\\nThat\u2019s the way it will be.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2013 Colin Meloy\\r\\nPortland, Oregon\\r\\nMay 5, 2011\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1448},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":452},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":302},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-og.jpg\",\"width\":1358,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":151},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":754},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":980},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/18/89-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.gillianwelch.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/gillianwelch\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/gillianwelch\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/gillianwelch\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"gillianwelch\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://variety-playhouse.com/event/1334499?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
