Having careened across America and beyond, sharing their staggering energy, the band made their third album the best way they know how: by themselves.  The same group that produced the scuzzy squalor of their debut \\\"Sunken,\\\" had legions of fans screaming along to their anthemic sophomore effort, \\\"Wild Onion,\\\" now swings and serenades with \\\"Down In Heaven\\\" (out on Grand Jury on May 13th).  \\r\\n\\r\\nCo-produced by the band and longtime collaborator R. Andrew Humphrey, and mixed by new confidant John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr., Kurt Vile, Sonic Youth), the record is by turns raw, polished and wise beyond its years.  The diverse new songs beg the listener to sway slowly, bang their head wildly and question what they were doing wasting emotional time on anything less.  It is a marked, and some may say mature, development for a band that doesn't know how to play it safe.  They aren't here to tell you what youth is like or what being a little older now means, though; they want to join you in a conversation about why we hurt, love and tug at each other. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Twin Peaks is a bit older, they're not necessarily calmer; their restlessness endures.  Born of Chicago's league-leading DIY scene and with several of them remaining friends since elementary school, Cadien Lake James, Clay Frankel, Connor Brodner, Jack Dolan, and most recent addition Colin Croom share an enthusiasm, authenticity and passion their audiences have found contagious.  In the three years since dropping out of college to support their debut album \\\"Sunken,\\\" the band has covered a lot of ground.  They've played to ever-increasing crowds, bigger and rowdier each time they come barreling into a city; they were anointed \\\"Best New Band\\\" by NME and countless other blogs, and they have performed for (and partied with) more than hospitable masses at festivals in the states and Europe, including Pitchfork, Lollapalooza, Reading & Leeds, and Roskilde.  In between all this action, the group set up camp in the summer of 2015 amidst the solitude of a murky lake in Western Massachusetts, where they could experiment and record on their own terms in the warm living room of a good friend's house.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecording on reel-to-reel with the band learning studio tricks on the fly, Twin Peaks set out to a make an LP that reflects how far they've come and how much of life is left, trusting themselves to make a record they'd want to hear.  James explains, \\\"I've been particularly drawn to records that have a more personal feel, not necessarily lyrically, but in sonic aesthetic, like The Kinks Village Green Society, Beatles White Album, and Rolling Stones Beggar's Banquet.  We wanted to make a record that employed the restraints of our favorite artists from yesteryear.  It was about trying to simplify and hone in on the things that are important to our music and ethos.\\\"  In considering the development of the band's sound from \\\"Sunken\\\" to \\\"Wild Onion\\\" and now to \\\"Down in Heaven,\\\" Frankel adds, \\\"The bands we admire are the ones who change drastically over the course of their span, like The Velvet Underground, where no two records of theirs sound the same.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nWhether sneering or pleading, aggressive or impatient, the thirteen tracks of \\\"Down In Heaven\\\" are a continuation of the bands path and an eschewing of previous comparisons.  It is a record all about feel: heartbreak, forgiveness, anger, jubilation, reinvention, growth.  Album opener \\\"Walk To The One You Love,\\\" written by James about letting someone close to you go is immediately followed by Frankel's song \\\"Wanted You,\\\" with lyrics about not getting the one that you yearn for.  With \\\"Stain,\\\" perhaps the biggest departure for the band on the record, Frankel says, \\\"I didn't want another love song, so after a while I got what it is, how you suffer for your art but you put up with it because you don't wanna do anything else.  It's a song about the love of music.\\\"  Even though four of the five members contribute lyrics, there are obvious connections both thematically and musically across the record and the band's voice rises unified. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Down in Heaven\\\" will bring old fans and new Twin Peaks most complex record to date, encompassing elements only teased on their previous efforts.  Frankel says, \\\"I don't know yet what kind of band we are, since we keep changing with every year.  I guess we are a band unafraid of new influences and changes.\\\"  Put simply, \\\"Down In Heaven\\\" makes it increasingly hard to call their sound \\\"classic.\\\" It's rock new and old, it's a little bit of country, it's a whole lot of punk attitude, and it's something to get excited about.  Twin Peaks is here to stay, and they aren't going to get pinned down.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":639},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":682},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/01/01-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://twinpeaksdudes.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/twinpeaksdenver\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/twinpeaksdudes/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/twinpeaksdudes\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"twinpeaksdudes\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1698575,\"name\":\"together PANGEA\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"together PANGEA do rock \u2018n\u2019 roll as it was meant to be \u2013 raw, unpredictable, and probably dangerous, but also blazing with intelligence, emotion, and edgy experimentation. The Los Angeles-based trio made their bones as purveyors of post-millennial punk, but with their third full-length release \u2013 and Harvest Records debut \u2013 BADILLAC, they pay their debt to the supersonic 90s rock that first inspired them. The band has not sacrificed a spurt of precious energy, instead integrating nuance and dynamic momentum to songs like \u201cNo Way Out\u201d and the undeniably badass title track. The volcanic riffs and massive melodies are matched by an equally provocative lyrical stance, with songs like \u201cSick Shit\u201d and the album-closing \u201cWhere The Night Ends\u201d casting an acerbic eye over the wreckage of the party they helped start \u2013 it\u2019s 3am and the drunken fun has given way to sexual panic, anxiety and self-doubt. Slightly stoned but by no means slack, BADILLAC reveals together PANGEA to be both confident and surprisingly committed, their audacious ambition already impossible to contain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt might be confusing for people, assuming we\u2019re like this garage punk band and then hearing this record,\u201d says singer/songwriter/guitarist William Keegan. \u201cBut we really don\u2019t want to get trapped at all.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nKeegan first started writing and recording in his Santa Clarita bedroom, his teenage tapes eventually coming to full flower with the aid of bassist Danny Bengston and drummer Erik Jimenez. Known then simply as Pangea, the band played countless beer blasts in and around CalArts, their boozy mayhem and breakneck pop hooks quickly earning them frenzied crowds throughout the Southern California DIY scene and beyond. A string of seven-inches, cassettes, and LPs \u2013 including 2011\u2019s ace second album, LIVING DUMMY, released by Burger Records and The Smell\u2019s Olfactory label \u2013 followed, as did gigs alongside a veritable who\u2019s-who of like-minded rockers, including Ty Segall, Mikal Cronin, Wavves, and The Black Lips (not to mention 2013\u2019s epic \u201cBurgerama Caravan of Stars\u201d US tour).\\r\\n\\r\\nBADILLAC was recorded with their longtime producer/engineer Andrew Schubert over three intensive sessions at his Tarzana studio, their roster augmented by second guitarist Cory Hanson (of the electronic pop outfit, W-H-I-T-E). While many bands in their position would have simply continued banging out the party punk, together PANGEA decided to throw a curveball at themselves and their fervent fanbase.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe wrote like 30 plus songs for this record,\u201d Bengston says, \u201chalf of which have the same punky bubblegum vibe of our last record. Then we had this other batch of songs, a little more melancholy, a little heavier, a little darker. I think in the end we just decided to try to not make the same record twice.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWhen I write, there are certain songs that I feel fit the band,\u201d Keegan says, \u201cand then there are songs where it doesn\u2019t feel like they fit. At some point, I was like, maybe we should try some of the songs that don\u2019t necessarily fit. Because I realized that they do fit \u2013 they\u2019re just different.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Keegan cites such unexpected heroes as Pete Seeger and 21st Century K Records artists like Little Wings and the Microphones, he fully fesses up to BADILLAC\u2019s most primal inspirations. Indeed, songs like \u201cWhy\u201d and the cello-laced \u201cNo Way Out\u201d fuse classic post punk ambivalence with fist-pumping stadium rock, their neurotic hooks, throat-rending vocals, and fat, distorted riffs hearkening back to the glory days of the alternative nation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cTo me, the album is so obviously influenced by the shit that I was listening to when I was 16,\u201d Keegan says. \u201cGrowing up in the 90s, all that stuff \u2013 Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Weezer. It wasn\u2019t conscious, the album just sounds like that. It feels like that music is etched in deeper that music I\u2019ve listened to as an adult. For whatever reason, the music you listened to when you\u2019re confused and young gets in deeper than anything you might listen to later.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBADILLAC also sees together PANGEA stepping away from their association with a much-hyped scene they believe too often revels in its own idiocy, Keegan\u2019s wry lyrics pushing both their music and subject matter towards unsettling themes of impotence, fear, ennui, and detachment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe think less and less about how we fit into this garage punk scene that we never even technically felt a part of,\u201d Keegan says. \u201cWe just kinda get lumped into that. I\u2019m not really stoked on what a lot of those bands are saying, there\u2019s a lot of misogyny and stuff I\u2019m not into.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLike any angst-ridden tunesmith worth his salt, Keegan also directs his gaze inwards, coming to turns with his own cynical view of relationships on songs like the mordant \u201cOffer,\u201d their cracked melodies and jaundiced skepticism fueled by his recent romantic struggles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI went through a really difficult relationship where we were breaking up every three months for four years,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of it, I was just like, \u201cThis is never gonna work.\u2019 It was pretty intense and I think that informs a lot of the songs on the album.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s kinda funny,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs soon as we finished this record, we broke up for good.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBADILLAC will drive together PANGEA through 2014, their imminent plans essentially consisting of touring until they drop. Nevertheless, the band finds themselves in the unprecedented position of having to ponder the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing where the next record is gonna go,\u201d Bengston says, \u201cwe still haven\u2019t put our finger on it yet.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Keegan says, \u201cbecause we never had to have those formal discussions, like, \u2018What should the next record sound like?\u2019 It\u2019s always been pretty natural. Hopefully that\u2019s what\u2019ll end up happening again.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":416,\"height\":416},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":416,\"height\":416},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-og.jpg\",\"width\":416,\"height\":416},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":416,\"height\":416},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":416,\"height\":416},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/89-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":416,\"height\":416}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://togetherpangea.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/togetherpangea\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/togetherpangea\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/togetherpangea\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"togetherpangea\"},{\"id\":1698597,\"name\":\"Golden Daze\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Golden Daze; LA based band; Ben Schwab/Jacob Loeb; Forthcoming full length debut to be released by Autumn Tone Records.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":452},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":452},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":212},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":141},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-og.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":452},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":71},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":353},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":640,\"height\":452},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/27/06/99-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/goldendazela/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/golden_daze\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"golden_daze\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.utphilly.com/event/1307183?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
