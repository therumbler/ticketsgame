Her first full-length record, \\\"Triggering A Flood\\\", was released in May 2013. Her expansive voice, laced with deep Texas twang but bearing the influence of favorite songwriters from the \u201870s folk-rock scene all the way through the present day, gives new life to old themes of finding love and freedom where you can and trying to hold yourself together when it slips away. She\u2019s already a favorite of some of the scene\u2019s brightest artists, having collaborated and played with the likes of Mike McClure, The Trishas, and new husband Jason Eady. With new material in the pipeline and a renewed interest in taking her music to a larger audience, she\u2019s becoming not only a peer in talent but an indispensable part of the regional independent country music world herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I suppose realism is what I look for in new music.

Someone's got to keep it alive, to preserve that kind of sound. That was our aim with this record.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJason Eady's extensive background in \\\"grown up issues\\\" is what explains why the word \\\"poet\\\" is so frequently associated with his name. A six-year stint in the US Air Force as a translator placed him in a slew of foreign cultures giving him a universal look into the nature of human beings and a good jumping off point for his comprehensive lyrical translations. The Mississippi native and Texas transplant has spent the last seven years in an incubation period undergoing a musical metamorphosis that has led him through lonesome delta blues, inspirational church house harmonies, poetically spun tales of Americana and into the naked and honest regions of good ole' country music.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis three previous record releases have laid an impressive foundation starting with his 2005 debut FROM UNDERNEATH THE OLD (produced by Walt Wilkins and Tim Lorsch). That was followed by his 2007 sophomore release, WILD EYED SERENADE (produced by Eady), which was tagged as the Top 50 Albums of the Year by the No Depression reader's poll and reached #14 on the Americana Music Chart.  WHEN THE MONEY'S ALL GONE (produced by Kevin Welch) is the last anyone has heard from Eady, until now.\\r\\n\\r\\nAM COUNTRY HEAVEN, Eady's fourth record release, originated as a side project with friend (and producer) Kevin Welch. The plan was to lay down some old school authentic country music out of sheer self-indulgence and as a labor of love. As the recordings got underway more and more people appeared in the studio contributing their ideas and adding their personal touches until their side project evolved into what is the highly anticipated album everyone is talking about. Eady says, \\\"I love that old school country music so much.  There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of artists doing it these days. It's almost the opposite\u2026like people are running away from it.  I admit that this record is a drastic departure from anything I have done before, but this is where my heart is.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAM COUNTRY HEAVEN features Redd Volkaert on guitar, Earl Poole Ball on piano, Tom Lewis on drums and Kevin Smith on acoustic bass -  all members of Austin's all-star team of country music players called Heybale. Combined, they have recorded and toured with artists such as Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, Johnny Cash, Junior Brown, Dale Watson, Connie Smith and Johnny Bush. They're responsible for the southern swagger on this album's tunes like \\\"AM Country Heaven\\\" and \\\"I'll Sure Be Glad When I'm Wrong.\\\"  Add legendary pedal steel player Lloyd Maines on the soulful \\\"Longer Walk In The Rain\\\" and \\\"Lying To Myself\\\" and a special vocal appearance from the incomparable Patty Loveless on \\\"Man On A Mountain\\\" and Eady's rich baritone timber, and what you have is a pure honky-tonk affair in the tradition of all the great troubadours that came before him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to his own albums, his talent for prose has been embraced by his peers landing him two cuts on Micky and The Motorcars' latest record RAISE MY GLASS, one cut on Eleven Hundred Springs' forthcoming record and two co-written cuts on The Trishas' forthcoming record. Eady also co-penned The Trishas' latest single \\\"Drive.\\\" Although the radical departure that is AM COUNTRY HEAVEN is sure to strike fans like a storm without warning, it seems that Eady is merely living up to his reputation for the element of surprise as perfectly stated by USA Today who said, \\\"This Mississippi native's blues-rocker creeps up like gathering thunderheads.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":972},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":304},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":202},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-og.jpg\",\"width\":2023,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":101},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":506},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":658},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/60/85-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ca/album/live-at-the-live-oak-vol.-1/id1080014317?mt=1&app=music\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.jasoneady.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/jasoneady\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/jasoneady\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"jasoneady\"},{\"id\":958639,\"name\":\"Max Stalling\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Texas based songwriter, Max Stalling, had no expectation of ever being in the music business. \\\"I didn't even pick up a guitar until graduate school,\\\" notes Stalling. After attending high school in South Texas, Stalling studied at Texas A&M - College Station, where he earned a masters degree in Food Science. He followed the corporate road from there and eventually landed in Dallas working in product development for Frito-Lay.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time, Stalling discovered the Three Teardrops Tavern and Dallas community radio station KNON. These outlets exposed a musical heritage to which Stalling had been nearly oblivious. Inspired by artists like Townes Van Zandt, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lyle Lovett, and Jerry Jeff Walker, Stalling started writing songs, recording albums, and eventually touring with a full band to back him. In June 2008, Stalling joined musical greats Kris Kristofferson, Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, Selena, Guy Clark and many others when he received a star on the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi.\\r\\n\\r\\nStalling's style is modern with a vintage feel. With Jeff Howe on drums and percussion, Bryce Clarke on nylon-string guitar, electric guitar and mandolin, and Jason Steinsultz swapping between stand-up and electric bass, Stalling creates a dynamic live show that's smart, charming and as listenable as it is danceable. Stalling and troupe are equally at home on a huge concert stage in front of thousands or playing an acoustic set for a hundred. Attendance numbers at shows have continued to rise. \\\"I chalk it up to the strength of the songs and the strength of my band\\\", comments Max.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite playing the same circuit as many household names in Texas country, grouping Stalling with them would be premature. His unique voice and amusingly clever song lyrics pull him in a different direction - a direction most obviously evident in his newest record Home to You.\\r\\n\\r\\nStalling has put together an elite team for his newest project, including recording heavyweight and Grammy winner Lloyd Maines. Maines has been instrumental in developing the sounds of some of the best artists in music and has worked with industry giants including the Dixie Chicks, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Bruce Robison. Band members Steinsultz, Howe and Clark are featured prominently on the recordings as well as Stalling's wife Heather. \\\"I'm very proud of the life that everyone has given these songs,\\\" says Max. \\\"They poured their hearts and souls into this project and I think people will be wowed by what they can do.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHome to You may be the best and most well rounded collection of songs that Stalling has released to date. The opening track is an unexpected tune borrowed from Austin music fixture Bob Schneider, which Stalling makes his own by staying true to his rootsy, Americana vibe which is evident throughout the entire album. Next, we hear fan favorite \\\"I Aint Drinking Alone\\\" and a surprising revisited version of a previous Stalling track. With songs about love, love lost, and the road, the album is a perfect candidate for the repeat button on any music player. The collection wraps up with, \\\"The Fantasy Dinner,\\\" which is a light-hearted, story song that captures Stalling's creative mind in a way that will keep the listener intrigued and singing along by the second chorus. Matched with master musicianship and production, this album will keep your foot tapping, heart pounding, and dancing shoes worn.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome to You will be available August 17, 2010, following four previous studio projects (Topaz City, 2008; Comfort In the Curves, 1997; Wide Afternoon, 2000; One of the Ways, 2002) and two live releases (Sell-Out, 2006; Live From The Granada CD/DVD 2009).

She's not concerned with your feelings if they come at the expense of her honesty. That's not to say she's ungracious or rude, just direct and unflinchingly true.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilson sang around the house growing up (when no one else was around the house, that is), but didn't start playing music and writing songs until she was a college sophomore at Texas A&M. \\\"My cousin and I went to go see the Dixie Chicks in Houston during their Fly tour. There was a part in the show where the other girls went off and Natalie stayed on stage and played 'Cold Day in July' on guitar by herself. I was watching her and I told my cousin, 'I just need a guitar; I could do that. I'm musical enough.',\\\" Jamie remembers.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that month, Jamie's cousin and mother went in together to buy Jamie her first guitar as a Christmas gift. She first learned to play by printing out lyrics to songs and learning the chords by ear. Wilson quickly learned every song on both Dixie Chicks records, all of Phil Pritchett's Heritage Way album, and all of the tunes on Bruce Robison's Long Way Home From Anywhere. She wrote her first song a couple of months later and was in a band, the Sidehill Gougers, within six months of receiving that first guitar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We would have practice every Tuesday at Shane's [Shane Walker, Sidehill Gougers founding member] house, and nobody, except for Shane, knew what they were doing. I could barely even play guitar and Shane had me playing banjo too,\\\" Jamie recalls. It didn't take long for the band to get up to speed, and within a year they had released their first CD, Runaway Scrape, with Walker and Wilson sharing the vocals and splitting the songwriting duties. The Gougers (after dropping \\\"Sidehill\\\") would go on to release an EP and another full-length record before musical and personal differences resulted in the band parting ways over the course of 2009. As the Gougers were winding down, Wilson found a side project - originally envisioned as a one-time only performance - taking off.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly each January, thousands of Texans cross the Red River and make the trek up the Rockies to enjoy MusicFest - five days of Texas music, friendship, and skiing (not to mention hundreds of gallons of Jaegermeister). A staple of recent MusicFests has been a tribute to a Texas artist, with many of the festival's performers doing a song or two of the featured songwriter. In 2009, the artist honored was Kevin Welch. The star of the tribute show was Wilson's new group, the Trishas.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiz Foster, then of the husband and wife duet Liz & Lincoln, is credited with putting the group together to play two songs for the tribute. A natural for the band was Kevin Welch's daughter Savannah. Foster also enlisted another member of a male-female duo - Kelley Mickwee of Jed and Kelley. Jamie Wilson was the last one to join.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey originally dubbed themselves the Fat Trishas (in jest, each one of these girls could stand a second slice of pie) before shortening the name to the Trishas. The group was the buzz of the five-day festival and before they realized it, this one-night only group was offered gigs that none of its members had been able to score in years of trying with their other efforts. Wilson sums it up. \\\"I guess it's easier to have four chicks in a band than one.\\\" The instant attention allowed the group to bypass the usual due-paying three hour gigs. Instead they play 50 minute slots at festivals and high-profile opening sets, and focus on making those 50 minutes as tight as possible. \\\"Having four girls in the band might get people out to see us once,\\\" Wilson explains, \\\"but they're not coming back unless the music is really good.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey've also been invited to record backing vocals on songs for artists such as Ray Wylie Hubbard and Raul Malo. They secured management and a booking agent in late 2009, but still approach things with a side project mindset, giving them the freedom to turn down offers that they would have jumped at in the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band plans to ramp up their opportunities and their profile even more by recording a debut album early in 2010. Many producers have already expressed interest in working with the group on the record, but no concrete decisions have been made as the girls finish rounding the material for the sessions into shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January the Trishas returned to the place where their career started one short year ago. They were one of seven female acts playing at MusicFest, which had 38 acts overall. Close to 20% is an impressive number of females for a Texas Music festival; even more impressive though is the fact that Jamie Wilson represents almost half of those acts. Along with performing in the Trishas, Jamie also has a set with Johnny and the Footlights, a county classics cover band that she fronts along with Jason Eady, and one set for an artist she rarely appears as - Jamie Wilson.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter years of only being identified by the band she played with, Wilson has recorded her first solo record, Dirty Blonde Hair, an EP which will be released in early 2010. \\\"I was in a band almost as soon as I got a guitar. Then before the Gougers were even done, this thing with the Trishas was taking off. I wanted to at least get some of my own music out there. Something that's just me,\\\" Wilson states. The EP combines the best elements of Wilson's work with the Gougers and the Trishas, but just a touch more - according to Wilson - \\\"Creepy. It seems that death seeps into all of my songs in one way or another.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The River\\\", the first song on Dirty Blonde Hair, sets the tone, with baritone guitar, banjo, electric guitar, and squeeze box creating the setting for Wilson's rich and distinctive vocals. \\\"Dusty Shoes\\\" showcases Wilson at her lyrical best, singing to a flawed lover: \\\"I'm not the trusting kind, I'm not the answer / I'm not the one to fix your kind of cancer / but I'll do anything that you ask of me / if it'll ease your pain, ease your lonely\\\". \\\"Little Too Rough\\\" sounds like a triple-A hit waiting to happen, and on the title track Wilson combines a waltz and back-masked electric guitar to heartbreaking effect. The biggest hook of the record lands in the chorus of the relentlessly toe-tapping \\\"Ordinary People\\\". The EP concludes with an epic version (7 minutes) of \\\"Whistling\\\", a song that is a Trishas staple and is virtually assured to appear on their full-length record as well, albeit with a far different arrangement. In just six songs, Wilson presents a complete portrait of an artist, leaving none of the colors in her palette unused.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to releasing the EP and recording a full-length album with the Trishas, Jamie has another big project on her plate for 2010 - she and husband Roy are expecting their first child in June of 2010. A near-obsessive planner (She presented Roy with an elaborate travel plan for her gigs along with a detailed list of who could help care for the baby in each city where Wilson has regular gigs. Roy listened patiently before responding, \\\"You know this baby is going to have a dad, right?\\\"), Jamie has scheduled all of her 2010 to fit around the time she'll need to take off. \\\"We're recording in April or May, my baby's due in late June, we can do all of the artwork and publicity through the summer, and then try to release the record in September.\\\" Wilson plans to hit the road with the band in support of the record immediately after the release, bringing along a merch person/nanny in tow.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if the reality of 2010 doesn't match her exacting plan for it, Wilson will make it through fueled by the excitement over the possibilities the year promises. An excitement unmatched since she had that realization over nine years ago that playing and writing songs was something she could do.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Michael Devers\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-og.jpg\",\"width\":1365,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/34/61/51-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://jamielinwilson.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/jamielinwilson\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"jamielinwilson\"},{\"id\":1444715,\"name\":\"Kaitlin Butts\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":657,\"height\":822},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":375},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":250},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-og.jpg\",\"width\":657,\"height\":822},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":125},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":626},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":813},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/92/77/45-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"0qyErgQCMn8\",\"title\":\"Kaitlin Butts // Wild Rose (Live Session)\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0qyErgQCMn8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0qyErgQCMn8\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/kaitlinbutts\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1133961,\"name\":\"Owen Temple\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Austin, Texas-based songwriter Owen Temple masterfully  constructs songs and stories about eccentric characters set in small towns and on the fringes of big cities.
