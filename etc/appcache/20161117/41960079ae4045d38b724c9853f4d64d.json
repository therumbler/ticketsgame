Fang\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Red Fang \\\"You and your bros are cruising the strip in your van, drinking beer and generally tearing shit up.  Great start to the night!  You know what you need to do next?  You need to Murder The Mountains with Red Fang.  This album and every song on it gets a big thumbs up on the hell yeah meter because every next song makes you go \\\"hell yeah!\\\" and then reach for the volume knob. By the time you get to the last track, it's gonna be loud as fuck in your van which is exactly as it should be on dudes night out.  Red Fang will have you singing along with your head out the window like a dog who just ate your stash.  And speaking of dogs, you gotta see the video for their song \\\"Prehistoric Dog.\\\"   The thing is, you're reading about how great this band is, how much you're gonna love this record \u2013 and you will, because it is badass \u2013 but what you probably don't know yet is just how hilarious and awesome the band's music videos are. Red Fang are four guys from Portland, Oregon and they are makers of really cool videos.  They are car smashing, milk gallon blasting, brewski-chugging, air guitar shredding, beer can armor-making, D&D nerd slaying rulers of the 'tube and you will love every minute of it.  Good thing is you and your buddies now have something fun to watch when you get home from painting the town with a red fang.\\\" -Rolling Heavy Magazine\\n\\nRED FANG is the latest effort from long time bros and collaborators Bryan Giles (Last of the Juanitas, Party Time), Aaron Beam (Dark Forces, Lachrymator), David Sullivan (Party Time, facedowninshit, Shiny Beast) and John Sherman (Party Time, Bad Wizard, Trumans Water, All Night). The four have boiled down their disparate sounds to create the ONLY sound: RED FANG.\\n\\n\\\"I've known Red Fang for a long time \u2014 from before their very humble beginnings in 1972, even. I knew them in the early days when they were grody dirt wizards that you never wanted to see with their shirts off. But there we were in Teeksville, Vermont, at 4 a.m. After literally burning the club to the ground following their poorly attended set, I'm pounding on the door of the cutest little bed and breakfast you've ever laid eyes on with a very drunk and hungry Red Fang demanding a pancake breakfast \u2014 topless.\\n\\nIn the years since, a few things have changed: The band successfully rescued guitarist David Sullivan from a hoarding situation (featured on the \\\"If The House Is a Rockin'...\\\" episode of Hoarders),bassist/vocalist Aaron Beam received his master's degree in the Smooooth Sciences, guitarist/vocalist Bryan Giles started the world's first 100-perecent anti-organic farm in his kitchen, and drummer John Sherman has climbed Mt. Everest in the nude, making him only the third person ever to do so. And none of them wets the bed anymore! That's just the stuff that's been on the news. They've also been touring the world like mad, playing to thousands of sweaty, hygienically-challenged maniacs at festivals and non-ventilated venues alike. They've made several award-winning music videos that have lots and lots of views because they're hilarious and awesome. Then this spring, they jogged 14 miles round trip to the studio everyday for 666 days and recorded a new record called Whales and Leeches.\\n\\nI caught up with guitarist Bryan Giles at his neighborhood coffee shop shortly after the band recorded Whales and Leeches and asked him what their influences were while recording the new material. Giles took a slow drink of his perfectly frothed cafe latte and thoughtfully replied, \\\"What are you, a fucking cop?\\\" Looking for a little more insight, I asked how he thought the band had grown since their last record. He replied, \\\"I don't know who the fuck you are, man. If you don't stop bothering me, you're going to be eating that fucking iPad!\\\" It's clear that there's a lot of excitement about Whales and Leeches in the Red Fang camp.\\n\\nYou're probably not saying to yourself, \\\"So they kind of have their shit together, big deal! What does Whales and Leeches sound like?\\\" because you're not reading this anymore. You've already started listening to the record, or you've decided you're more concerned with whether Bon Iver is still a thing or not. On the off chance that you're a college paper writer hungry for the red-hot scoop, here's some things to know about their new record that you should already be listening to and forming your own opinions about:\\n\\nThe record sounds very excellent and professional, you can tell that they've been practicing their instruments. Their songs sound more thought-out and trippier. Bryan and Aaron sound like they've gotten better at singing. Every song has a riff you like. Mike Scheidt from YOB sings on a song, so you're gonna like that. It sounds more mature, like good cheese or your Aunt Sharon. Do you want me to keep rubbing your ear crotch? Sorry, I'm kind of a tease! You're just going to have to take a few minutes to listen and let Red Fang's filthy hands take the wheel, then come up with your own adjectives and opinions. I think it's a great record and they're going to make folks proud. I hope they don't get all famous and stuck up and then the VH1 special and, oh Christ.\\n\\nWhen reflecting on what the future might hold for Red Fang, I think drummer John Sherman slurred it best: \\\"wchhy are yooo solllannngmm? Let's maake ths sitchoo-ashun AWESome!\\\" You said it, John. This is definitely the year for Red Fang.\\\"\\n\\n- Written by Jared Warren of The Melvins\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":170,\"height\":245},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":170,\"height\":245},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atlg.png\",\"width\":170,\"height\":245},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atmd.png\",\"width\":170,\"height\":245},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-og.png\",\"width\":170,\"height\":245},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":144},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atxl.png\",\"width\":170,\"height\":245},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atxl1.png\",\"width\":170,\"height\":245},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atxxl.png\",\"width\":170,\"height\":245},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/19/43/81-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":170,\"height\":245}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.redfang.net\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/redfangpdx\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/redfangband\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/redfang\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"redfang\"},{\"id\":335947,\"name\":\"Torche\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The four-pronged Floridian Riff Colossus that has steamrolled its way across the international underground. Led by vocalist/guitarist Steve Brooks (formerly of doom dropouts Floor) and featuring the myriad talents of drummer Rick Smith, bassist Jonathan Nu\u00f1ez and guitarist Juan Montoya, Torche unfurled their self-titled debut in 2005 via Richmond, Virginia's Robotic Empire. The glorious half-hour of blissed-out power-grooves, triumphant vocal harmonies and cosmic resonance within was variously hailed as \\\"stoner pop,\\\" \\\"thunder rock,\\\" and \\\"doom pop,\\\" but a consensus was quickly reached within the Fourth Estate: Both the underground and mainstream press had their hands halfway down their pants just thinking about listening to Torche. The band was immediately lauded as giants among men, leaders among sheep, and powerbrokers of a deadly new sonic idiom founded upon Brooks' signature \\\"bomb-string\\\" detonation-detune. As Decibel magazine so righteously pointed out in May of 2005, Torche \\\"carries on in the dizzying Sabbathian tradition of Floor, only potentially more bottomless and epic.\\\" Seven months later, the same publication would declare Torche as the # 7 album of the year in its annual top 40.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/30/02/17-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/30/02/17-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/30/02/17-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/30/02/17-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/30/02/17-og.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/30/02/17-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/30/02/17-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/30/02/17-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/30/02/17-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/30/02/17-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":267},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/30/02/17-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.torchemusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/torche\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/torcheofficial\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/torcheband\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"torcheband\"},{\"id\":686633,\"name\":\"Whres.\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Atlanta, GA\u2019s kings of noise rock, Whores have announced a string of summer US tour dates in support of their latest critically acclaimed release Clean.
