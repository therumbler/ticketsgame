Through years of open mic nights and intimate local shows he developed a highly personable stagecraft and performance that conveys his natural warmth and wit. His ability to connect with the audience cuts through pretence and gently draws you into his vulnerabilities, longings, impressions and imaginings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn \u2018Knots,\u2019 Malarkey muses on the many tangles, binds and mysteries of modern romance through infectious melodies and provocative lyrics, which are his trademark. \u201cLet everything happen to you, beauty and terror,\u201d writes Rilke, in one of Malarkey\u2019s favourite poems.  These songs take you to those places where both the light and the darkness are stitched together - leaving listeners to reflect on the polarities in life and love while opting for the greater fullness that acceptance of the struggle brings. \u201cJust keep going. No feeling is final,\u201c Rilke concludes the poem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI\u2019m the only one who\u2019s tangled up in here, but I\u2019ve grown to love the knots,\u201d Michael sings in the final song, \u201cThe beauty of running circles is that you never seem to stop. You just connect the dots.\u201c The EP ends repeating those words in what almost becomes a plea to the subconscious or a mantra for the soul, in full melancholic triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBIOG\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Lebanon, raised in Ohio and having trained in London Michael Malarkey is now an Atlanta-based musician and actor whose versatile talent has seen him command both stage and screen on both sides of the pond. He is currently a series regular in hit CW drama, The Vampire Diaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nSinging in various punk and hardcore bands in his younger years, Malarkey began to teach himself the guitar and began to writing songs that eventually developed into his own style of story-telling, soul-searching alternative folk. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe debut five-song offering, Feed The Flames EP saw Michael combine honest and exposing insights to his relationships with love, obsession and commitment with a playful commentary on the world around him, all carried along by his knack for a catchy melody and intricate musicianship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough The Night And Back Again is the first single taken from the EP and features a sensitively plucked acoustic guitar that blends beautifully with Malarkey\u2019s vocal style upon a bed of tightly harmonised vocals and considered instrumentation. Throughout the EP his influences are clear and navigate their way through Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, and Nick Cave but ultimately stay true to Malarkey\u2019s own distinctive hallmark of emotive and vivid imagery, merging his punk roots to narrative-driven acoustic songs filled with angst, irony, love and conflict in equal measure. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith his acting career in full assent, Malarkey has simultaneously cultivated a body of music that is establishing him as a distinctive and captivating crossover talent, winning over audiences in both the music and acting arenas.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":685,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":420},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":280},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-og.jpg\",\"width\":685,\"height\":960},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":140},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":701},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":911},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/54/46/71-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://www.soundcloud.com/mkmalarkey\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/mkmalarkey\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/mkmalarkey\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"mkmalarkey\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1366503?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
