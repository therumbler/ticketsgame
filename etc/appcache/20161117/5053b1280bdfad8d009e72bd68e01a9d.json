Allin. NOBUNNY is the alter ego of Justin Champlin, who was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona, and relocated to San Francisco, California.Champlin first made a name for himself as the drummer with garage punks the Okmoniks and later co-founded the Sneaky Pinks, a two-man punk-pop party machine.\\nWith NOBUNNY, Champlin streamlined the concept of the Sneaky Pinks by paring the consistent lineup down to just one person (or one mutant; as part of the NOBUNNY myth, Champlin claims to be the product of a liaison between a woman and a jackalope). Sometimes working solo and sometimes backed by a constantly shifting group of musicians, Champlinhas been performing as NOBUNNY since 2001, though it wasn't until 2008 that he made his recorded debut with the album Love Visions. Primarily recorded at home with Champlin handling most of the instruments, Love Visions was released by the tiny Bubbledum Records label; it earned enthusiastic reviews in the underground music press and was reissued in 2009 by the somewhat larger 1-2-3-4 Go! Records. In 2009, NOBUNNY put out a single through Horizontal Action Records, \\\"Give It to Me\\\" b/w \\\"Motorhead with Me,\\\" and a cassette-only album, Raw Romance, on Burger Records.\\nNOBUNNY also kept up a busy touring schedule in the wake of Love Visions, telling reporter Eric Allen, \\\"The road is good, because at least I know where my next meal is coming from. I find life much easier on tour. It's not being on tour that is hard for me.\\\" In September of 2010, NOBUNNY's second full-length album, First Blood, was released by Goner. After a relatively quiet 2011 with no recordings released, NOBUNNY returned in 2012 with a single for Suicide Squeeze and an EP for Goner. He stuck with Goner for his third full-length blast of garage punk, 2013's Secret Songs.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":641},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":134},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-og.jpg\",\"width\":1024,\"height\":684},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/23-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://nobunny.bandcamp.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/nobunnylovesyou\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/NOBUNNY/67340059424?v=info\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/NOBUNNYLOVESYOU\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"NOBUNNYLOVESYOU\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1770026,\"name\":\"Cosmonauts\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Cosmonauts are a California-based band known for their simple, physically powerful songs and punishing stage volume. Cosmonauts were formed in 2009 by guitarists Alexander Ahmadi and Derek Cowart, natives of Fullerton in Orange County. They met when a mutual friend staged a house show and the two ended up jamming together. As Cowart told a reporter, \\\"It was almost the same fashion as when the Clash approached (Joe) Strummer. 'I like you, but I hate your band,' is pretty much what Alex told me. I was like, 'That's alright. I hate my band, too.'\\\" Teaming with bassist James Sanderson III and drummer Cole Devine, the four became Cosmonauts, and began hashing out powerful, drone-inspired guitar jams inspired by Spacemen 3, Sonic Youth, and the Velvet Underground. The group also discovered a simple way to get its trademark thick, reverb-heavy sound: using old amps and driving them as loud as possible. (As Cowart says, \\\"The Kinks didn't get their tones from pedals, they just blew out their amps. It sounds cooler that way.\\\") A few months after their first shows, Cosmonauts released their first album, a cassette-only offering issued by the label/record shop Burger Records that hit the street in the summer of 2010. Cosmonauts soon set out on their first tour, landed a spot at the South by Southwest Music Conference, and began releasing fresh material at a steady pace, including the cassette-only New Psychic Denim EP and a handful of 7\\\" singles. In 2011, Cosmonauts' debut album was reissued on vinyl by Chicago's Permanent Records, and the band's many singles were compiled on a cassette-only collection, Natalie Wilson's Arm. Their second full-length, If You Wanna Die Then I Wanna Die, was released in 2012, and in 2013 the group reunited with Burger to release a third album, Persona Non Grata. - MARK DEMING\\n\\n\\\"Their raucous set was like if the Velvet Underground had turned to the MC5 at their Boston Tea Party concert in 1968 and, instead of insulting them, had turned and made love to them\u2014and that was how Lou Reed wound up wearing that dog collar. I couldn't make out a single lyric, but did they really close the set with 'Little Honda?'\\\" --LA RECORD\\n\\n\\\"Swirling, distorted psych, bulldozed along by pounding primitive drums, fuzzed out vocals, all glued together with a heavy spaced out guitar drone. If that ain't the ingredients for record of the month my name is Prince Bloody William. Imagine if you will the best of THEE OH SEES jamming deep with MOON DUO, with the aid of some sort of retro type drug that only Brace Belden knows the name of and you would almost be right on the money. Heavy, without losing one single hook, repetitive without being the least bit boring and shamelessly stepped in the glory years of acid rock without being a boring regurgitating hipster.

The mood is perfectly represented by the cover photograph by Chicago architectural photographer Richard Nickel of a scaffolded building bathed in an otherworldly light, giving the image a surreal semblance, skewing perspective & giving the impression of the image tumbling toward the viewer.\\n\\nThe album was recorded by the band at guitarist Dave Vettraino's house between July 2014 and January 2016 (on assorted tape machines of varying degrees of quality and working order.), and they worked to create an album that exists independently from their identity as a performing group, purposely juxtaposing content and non-content so that a listen through is an engaging balancing act between space and chatter. - Trouble in Mind Records\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":206,\"height\":309},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":206,\"height\":309},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":206,\"height\":309},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-og.jpg\",\"width\":206,\"height\":309},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":206,\"height\":309},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":206,\"height\":309},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":206,\"height\":309},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/60/25-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":206,\"height\":309}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/the-hecks\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Hecks/271748619562036\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1382369?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
