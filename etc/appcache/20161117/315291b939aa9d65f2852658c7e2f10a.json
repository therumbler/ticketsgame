Club is comprised of Mason James of Cerebral Ballzy and Lissy Trullie of Lissy Trullie. \u201cI was never pigeonholed into liking one specific genre,\u201d says Mason, the no-nonsense guitarist and founding member behind the addictive assault of a new-wave inspired band alongside multi-instrumentalist, co-writer, and vocalist Lissy Trullie. \u201cIf it sounds good I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s from the 1920s or the 2016s. As a musician, you take little tidbits of cool sounds you hear and combine them into something completely unique. Music needs to reflect on itself.\u201d Such a lack of musical inhibition goes a long way in explaining how Mason, a raucous punk-rock kid whose life goals were once to \u201cthrash around onstage and get wildly drunk\u201d with his previous band, Cerebral Ballzy, and Trullie, a successful solo artist in her own right with her eponymous indie-rock band, threw caution to the wind and concocted pop music unlike any they\u2019ve made before. \u201cI really respect and love well-written hooks. That\u2019s always something that gets me excited,\u201d Trullie says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge change and not a logical one,\u201d Mason says with a laugh of Zipper Club\u2019s pop missiles, which he began penning two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a super 180 for me. But that\u2019s what I think is really cool about it. It made me realize that the music is the only thing that matters.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nZipper Club is at its core a union of like-minded musicians who share a musical story and, through their respective former bands, have each navigated the rocky waters of the music industry. The result is a blissful head rush of a band now coming to the fore, armed with buzzing guitars, spacey synths and magnetic melodies via its debut single, \u201cGoing The Distance.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s music that\u2019s not trying to be something it\u2019s not,\u201d Trullie says of the band\u2019s addictive, brain-lodging sound on its forthcoming debut album, produced by James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins, A Perfect Circle).  Adds Mason: \u201cIt\u2019s synth-bred, weird-sounding music that\u2019s different but still melodic and palatable.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cGoing The Distance\u201d is in many ways a perfect encapsulation of the no-holds-barred attitude of Zipper Club. \u201cIt was very appropriate for me, reflective of a road to nowhere I was on at the time, and I wrote it as a coping mechanism,\u201d he says of a song he describes as \u201cMy attitude at the time was \u2018I\u2019m going to do whatever I want. I\u2019m going to wake up at 2 and no one can stop me.\u201d He laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s actually kind of the most punk song on the album.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nMason began writing the songs that formed the backbone of Zipper Club principally out of creative necessity. After touring for several menacing years \u2014 \u201cI was falling apart at the time due to too much time on the road\u201d \u2014 the remedy was to hole up in his apartment. He began writing songs inspired by the diverse musical tastes of his childhood. He decided he was going to do something new and hook-heavy pop gems quickly sprang to the surface. When out in Los Angeles, in 2014, Mason linked up with Iha with whom he\u2019d previously worked. \u201cHe was the only producer I had on my list,\u201d he says of the producer whom the band characterizes as a \u201csubtle mad scientist.\u201d In short order Mason laid down some early songs, brought accomplice Lissy into the fold and solidified what became Zipper Club. For Lissy, Zipper Club marks an invigorating new creative path: no longer carrying the sole weight of a project, she\u2019s now found a creative partner to share in the collective musical journey. \u201cI was looking for a breath of fresh air and a new creative outlet,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I found it.\u201d   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe connection was an undeniable one: both musicians are at their core songwriters and storytellers, albeit ones who happen to recognize an infectious hook when they hear it. They also share similar musical sensibilities: Mason was raised on a steady diet of Motown, while Lissy similarly gravitated towards vintage R&B and soul due in large part to her record-collecting father. \u201cIt was instantaneous,\u201d Mason says of he and Trullie bonding over lunch in New York. \u201cI was like, this is going to be cool. She\u2019s rad!\u201d Trullie, for her part, says she was already sold on the project before ever meeting Mason. \u201cMy ears perked up as soon as I heard the demos,\u201d she recalls thinking, \u201cYeah, I definitely want to throw down on this!\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nZipper Club soon hunkered down with Iha for additional writing and recording sessions at Eye Sky Studios in North Hollywood. Collaborating with Lissy created \u201cthis spark\u201d that Mason could never have foreseen. Additionally, as the pair has subsequently co-written what became the rest of Zipper Club\u2019s debut LP, their musical cohesion has only grown stronger. Trullie says writing with her new bandmate has shown her the musical bond with her and Mason is real and makes total sense for the both of them. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s opening up more and more every day,\u201d she says. Adds Mason: \u201cThere\u2019s something really cool about a healthy musical partnership,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been super constructive. You\u2019re building a car and the machine starts to work. We are in cruise control and it feels really good.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMason points to the pummeling, echo-laden \u201cRegrets\u201d \u2014 on which Trullie sings, \u201cTalking to you makes me second guess/Living my life with no regrets\u201d \u2014 as one of the earliest and most powerful collaborations between he and his new musical counterpart. \u201cA light bulb went off when Lissy sang over it,\u201d the guitarist says when recalling the experience. This was the moment when they realized, \u201cThis works!\u201d \u2013 and that feeling is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Trullie says, \u201cIt\u2019s about making good music.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nZipper Club aren\u2019t slowing down: the band is currently putting the final touches on their debut album and prepping for what promises to be a busy summer. Their multi-sensory live show promises to be every bit as much an endorphin-releasing adrenaline shot as their scorching new songs. \u201cIt\u2019s all about trying to come out there with a bang.\u201d Trullie couldn\u2019t agree more: \u201cIt\u2019s full-speed ahead.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":720},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":225},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":150},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1536},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":75},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":375},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":488},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/66/03-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://zipperclub.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/ZipperClubMusic/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/ZipperClubMusic\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"ZipperClubMusic\"},{\"id\":1739803,\"name\":\"My Jerusalem\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"<iframe width=\\\"450\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMbv1PWRp28\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\\/iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the icy waters and snow-covered shores of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, New York, Jeff Klein locked himself in a rental house and did nothing but write for a month. A few blocks away, in the Midwood area, sits the home in which his mother grew up. A prolonged illness had claimed her life a few years earlier.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cThat was me coming to terms with the whole situation,\u201d the My Jerusalem frontman explains of his attempt to embed himself within his family history after many years of being on the road, touring. \u201cI kept walking by this house my grandparents used to live in on Avenue H. I\u2019ve never been very connected to family. I\u2019ve romanticized the idea of family, but I think I was just trying to connect with something.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nKlein, who normally resides in Austin, felt an immediate inspiration there and was prolific during these winter weeks near his mother\u2019s childhood neighborhood, producing 14 songs, 12 of which would come to be the band\u2019s forthcoming album, A Little Death.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cThe little death,\u201d or \u201cla petite mort\u201d in French, refers to, well, an orgasm, and somewhere between the literal definition and the slang is where Klein situated the album. \u201cLike any kid, I was obsessed with death and obsessed with sex. Some people grow out of it and start families and become normal people and some of us just stay the same,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m still obsessing about the psychology behind death and sex.\u201d\\r\\n \\r\\nThis duality bleeds through on the album, which flexes a lurid sexual energy, reminiscent of something between Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Echo and the Bunnymen. Though My Jerusalem has been kicking around in some capacity since 2010, A Little Death is the first album with a solidified lineup. Previously, the band had been more of a collective, with contributions from Klein\u2019s revolving door of friends from previous projects, Gutter Twins and The Twilight Singers, and who had also played in bands like Cursive, Okkervil River, and the Polyphonic Spree. Now, with a full-time lineup of members including Grant Van Amburgh (drums), Kyle Robarge (bass), and Jon Merz (guitar, keys, horns), My Jerusalem is a true band, Klein says.\\r\\n \\r\\nAlongside standout tracks like the high-energy \u201cRabbit Rabbit\u201d and the slowed down banger \u201cNo One Gonna Give You Love,\u201d Klein also enlisted the help of another friend on A Little Death\u2019s opener, \u201cYoung Leather,\u201d singer Elle King, who contributes background vocals under the song\u2019s raging saxophone. The two have history back to when King was younger and used to work at the tattoo shop where Klein\u2019s friends would hang out. Her timeless voice is the perfect complement to the old-fashioned nature of A Little Death, an album which pays homage to a classic era of rock and roll, one that lacked pretension and focused on honesty in songwriting.\\r\\n \\r\\n\u201cThe album has a throwback vibe to it,\u201d says Klein, who spent many nights walking around the time capsule of an area around his rental home, among the Russian immigrants and foreign culture of the New York blocks. \u201cI feel like you can hear Brooklyn in the 50s and 60s in that record, or maybe it\u2019s my delusional mind.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, through A Little Death, Klein was finally able to reflect on the family and personal issues he\u2019d put on the backburner for years. \u201cThere\u2019s a recurring theme of fate, luck, desire, and consequence,\u201d he says of it, \u201cand also, how to be more accountable as a human.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":618},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":193},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":193},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":129},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":129},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-og.jpg\",\"width\":1399,\"height\":901},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":64},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":64},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":322},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":322},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":419},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/65/14-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":419}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://thisismyjerusalem.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/myjerusalem\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/myjerusalem\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"myjerusalem\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1344415?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
