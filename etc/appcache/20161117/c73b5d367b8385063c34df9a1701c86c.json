Like most of their peers, they were distinguished by their hyperkinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997, when the single \\\"Sell Out\\\" became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Reel Big Fish's popularity gradually waned in the subsequent years, following the decline of ska-punk as a marketable genre. Nevertheless, the band restructured its lineup and continued issuing new material to a smaller (yet considerably rabid) fan base.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased in Huntington Beach, California, Reel Big Fish were originally a trio comprised of vocalist/guitarist Aaron Barrett, bassist Matt Wong, and drummer Andrew Gonzales. At that stage, the group was a conventional rock band with pop-metal leanings that covered both classic rock and Top 40 songs -- essentially, it was music designed for frat parties. After several months, the band discovered ska and decided to bolster its lineup with the addition of horn players. Reel Big Fish had a difficult time maintaining a stable horn section, and it took several years before their final lineup -- featuring Tavis Werts (trumpet), Scott Klopfenstein (trumpet, vocals), Grant Barry (trombone), and Dan Regan (trombone) -- fell into place.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything Sucks\\r\\nThis definitive incarnation of Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, Everything Sucks, in 1995. Everything Sucks became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label's president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced Turn the Radio Off, which marked the band's first album for Mojo. Turn the Radio Off was unleashed in August 1996, and over the next year, Reel Big Fish continually toured in support of the album's release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single \\\"Sell Out\\\" began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song's quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100. In July 1997, Reel Big Fish released the Keep Your Receipt EP, which contained \\\"Sell Out\\\" and several outtakes, new songs, and live cuts. Why Do They Rock So Hard followed a year later, and in early 2000 the band returned with a reissued version of Everything Sucks.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheer Up!\\r\\nThe guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive's parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish's first release for Jive, a rock-oriented record entitled Cheer Up!, appeared in mid-2002. Years of touring followed, during which the band shared stages with the likes of Sum 41, Catch 22, Lucky Boys Confusion, the Matches, and Zebrahead. Replacement drummer Carlos de la Garza (formerly of Suburban Rhythm) eventually decided to leave the lineup, and his last show with the group was recorded live at Anaheim's House of Blues in June 2003. A DVD of that performance, The Show Must Go Off!, was released by the end of the year, and the band's next album, the cynical yet catchy We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy, was issued in April 2005. By this time, the group's lineup had shifted to include Barrett, Regan, Klopfenstein, Wong, new trumpeter John Christianson, and drummer Justin Ferreira (who was later replaced by Ryland Steen).\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album\\r\\nTouring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since Cheer Up!'s release. A co-headlining tour with MxPx followed that summer, allowing Reel Big Fish the chance to gain their footing as an independent band. In August, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album. A few months later -- and much to the annoyance of the band -- Jive issued its own Reel Big Fish album, a best-of compilation entitled Greatest Hit...and More. Reel Big Fish received no money from the album's sales, as Jive Records now owned the rights to the bulk of their songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuet All Night Long\\r\\nNevertheless, Reel Big Fish returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP (Duet All Night Long) with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free followed several months later, marking the group's first full-length studio release since leaving Jive's roster, and 2009's Fame, Fortune and Fornication found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, Slade, and Tom Petty. In 2011, longtime member Scott Klopfenstein left Reel Big Fish to focus on raising a family, with Goldfinger's Matt Appleton taking over for him. The following year, the band released its first album of new material in five years, Candy Coated Fury.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":543},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":170},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":170},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":113},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":113},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1157},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":57},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":57},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":283},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":283},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":367},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/61-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":367}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.reel-big-fish.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/reelbigfish\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/ReelBigFish\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/REELBIGFISH\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"REELBIGFISH\"},{\"id\":969757,\"name\":\"Anti-Flag\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Great rock n' roll doesn't have to be mindless and socially conscious tunes don't have to be dull. When art and entertainment devolve into mere commercial escapism, the status quo of an oppressive system and the empty banality of mediocre music will prevail. ANTI-FLAG burst through the concrete wall of apathy like a proverbial desert flower. American Spring is an empowering, energetic antidote to the crippling cynicism that infects even the most dedicated of rabble-rousers. Co-produced by AWOLNATION\u2019s Kenny Carkeet, Jim Kaufman and the band, Anti-Flag\u2019s tenth studio album is both a shot across the bow of the political discourse and creatively challenging. American Spring is a stylistic leap forward that captures the essence of their dense catalog while conjuring a fresh new sound. Anti-Flag's commitment to high caliber neo-punk music remains as strong as their devotion to raising awareness. \\\"I hope this record can be an encouragement to people to never give up,\u201d declares Justin Sane, guitarist/vocalist and cofounder of Anti-Flag. \u201cI know that music changed my life.\u201d American Spring is the next natural step in a career that produced activist-punk classics like For Blood and Empire (2006), The Terror State (2003), and Underground Network (2001), and inspired international audiences to learn more about the Occupy movement, the anti-war movement, and the idea that \u201csocialism\u201d isn\u2019t a dirty word. Drawing inspiration equally from political thinkers like Howard Zinn and Cornel West as from The Clash and The Dead Kennedys, Anti-Flag got going in earnest in 1993, a year before massive records by Green Day, The Offspring and Rancid pushed punk back into the spotlight. Anti-Flag hail from Pittsburgh, site of the Homestead Steel Strike in 1892 (one of the most serious labor disputes in history), Hill District riots in the wake of Martin Luther King\u2019s assassination, in a state that helped birth abolitionism. Anti-Flag attacks the issues head on. Anti-poverty and social justice coalition Oxfam projects the world\u2019s wealthiest 1% will own more than 50% of the world\u2019s wealth by 2016, a fact tackled in \u201cThe Great Divide.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a class war going on. The rich are waging it on the poor and they\u2019re winning in a staggering wave of crushing defeats, over and over again,\u201d says Sane. \u201cMost wealth is concentrated in about 200 corporations, which are owned and run by a really small group of people. We're living in occupied territory. When the Germans in World War II occupied the French they had a resistance. It\u2019s up to all of us living in corporate occupied territory to be the resistance.\u201d As detailed by the essays in the American Spring liner notes, Anti-Flag\u2019s lyrics are as socio-politically minded as ever, but through the lens of deeply personal experience. Drummer/cofounder Pat Thetic\u2019s uniquely identifiable rhythms and the dual vocals of Sane and bassist/vocalist Chris #2 ensure each song retains the sound Anti-Flag has established, even as Sane and longtime guitarist Chris Head unleash their heaviest riffs. \u201cSky is Falling\u201d is one of the darkest Anti-Flag songs ever recorded, capturing the oppressive feeling of its subject matter, drone strikes. \u201cAll of the Poison, All of the Pain\u201d lashes out against nihilism, offering empathy to artists who\u2019ve lost themselves to hopelessness across the generations, but urgently insisting to keep up the fight. \u201cThe Debate is Over\u201d owes a debt to Naomi Klein\u2019s This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate. There\u2019s no more arguing to do about climate change. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s here. Chris #2 ended a relationship that consumed a huge portion of his life during the writing for American Spring. When he watched the events in Ferguson, Missouri unfold on television, he immediately felt the same rage he had hearing a not guilty verdict after a year and a half of court hearings surrounding the murder of his own sister. On American Spring, he\u2019s connected his personal life to the bigger political picture like never before. \u201cI felt torn up, vulnerable, and unsure of my identity. I'd never had that experience before. So whenever I started looking at the politics of the world, I couldn't help but connect each thing that was happening to something that had happened in my life.\u201d Punk icon Tim Armstrong (Operation Ivy, Rancid, The Transplants) guests on \u201cBrandenburg Gate,\u201d a song Chris #2 envisioned as akin to Billy Bragg\u2019s \u201cSocialism of the Heart\u201d meets The Clash. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to write a song with that sort of groove ever since I\u2019ve known I can write songs.\u201d \u201cWithout End\u201d confronts the false doctrine of perpetual war, dismantling the idea that a military \u201cvictory\u201d can be had over concepts like \u201cterror,\u201d topped off with a blistering solo from Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine. The entire band shares a strong point of view when it comes to compromise, to surrender, to giving up on the promise of a better world. Chris #2 flies the flag for optimism in the face of cynicism in songs like \u201cTo Hell with Boredom\u201d and \u201cBeliever,\u201d which declares: \u201cDon\u2019t give up / don\u2019t give in / there\u2019s no peace in the end / the war worth raging is right here.\u201d Sane rails against apathy on \u201cLow Expectations.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re coming up on a Presidential election where the choice could be between Hilary Clinton and Jeb Bush. So I get why people feel frustrated,\u201d says Sane, pointing specifically at the \u201ccorporatocracy\u201d described by former CIA operative John Perkins in Confessions of an Economic Hitman. \u201cWe can count on whomever gets elected to placate the banks, Wall Street, oil interests, and the military industrial complex.\u201d Unthinkable income inequality, militarized police, neo-colonialism, corporate oligarchy, apocalyptic environmental destruction, loss of privacy and individual liberty, crackdowns on whistleblowers, perpetual wars on the tightening grip of mainstream media, the prison industrial complex, fascism and extremism of all stripes\u2013 there\u2019s plenty to feel defeated about today. But as \u201cBeliever\u201d proclaims, that means justice is up to \u201cJust Us.\u201d \u201cChange happens one person at a time. It takes time. But it's important for those ideas to be out there,\u201d Sane insists. \u201cIt's impossible to connect with every single person. When you're putting an idea out there, you're just hoping it will resonate with enough people that it has some kind of ability to affect their lives. But change does happen in incremental steps. The first part of being involved is being aware. Then beyond that, there are steps we can all take to become a more active part of progressive resistance.\u201d Yes, thankfully there remain those whose resilience is assured, who fight harder against adversity and difficult odds. They are the proud torchbearers for progressive collectivism, radical change, and a free expression with heavy social responsibility. They are the artists with the talent to create works worthy of their message. Bessie Smith, Woody Guthrie, MC5, Bad Religion, Boogie Down Productions, The Clash \u2013 and after more than two decades, Anti-Flag carries the tradition forward, injecting the underground and the mainstream with politically charged, deliberate, smart-but-no-lessvisceral neo-punk. www.spinefarmrecords.com\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/36/92/63-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.anti-flag.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/antiflag\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/anti.flag.official\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/anti_flag\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"anti_flag\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1765810,\"name\":\"Ballyhoo!\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"A rock band with punk energy and pop reggae grooves, Baltimore\u2019s BALLYHOO! are a fun, fan-loving powerhouse.
