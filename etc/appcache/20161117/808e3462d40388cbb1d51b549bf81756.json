Interrupters\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Since the release of their 2014 self-titled debut, The Interrupters have split their time between touring with the likes of The English Beat and Bad Religion and cranking out new material that shows off their irrepressible sensibility. So when the time came to record their sophomore album Say It Out Loud, the L.A.-based ska-punk four-piece hit the studio with Rancid\u2019s Tim Armstrong and fired off 14 new songs that both capture their frenetic energy and reveal a whole new level of boldness in their songwriting. \\r\\n\\r\\nUndeniably fun but urgent in message, Say It Out Loud finds The Interrupters backing their 2-Tone-tinged, guitar-fueled yet melody-heavy sound with lyrics that confront everything from social control and self-empowerment to domestic violence and the media circus surrounding the next presidential election. \u201cOver the past couple years we got to know ourselves so much better as a band, and\\r\\nthat gave us a lot of room to really grow on this album,\u201d notes frontwoman Aimee Interrupter, whose bandmates include guitarist Kevin Bivona, bassist Justin Bivona, and drummer Jesse Bivona. \\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by Armstrong and recorded partly at his studio (as well as at Travis Barker\u2019s Opra Studios), Say It Out Loud achieved its vital feel thanks to what Kevin describes as a \u201ctotally organic, GMO-free process\u201d that relied on raw live performance. True to The Interrupters\u2019 unabandoned passion and personal-meets-political dynamic, the album kicks off with \u201cBy My Side,\u201d a fist-pumping but tender tribute to outcast solidarity (sample lyric: \u201cAfter all the stupid things we did/Our hearts are still beating\u201d). The band keeps it intimate and openhearted on songs like \u201cOn a Turntable,\u201d whose snarling guitar riffs and growling vocals pay homage to the life-saving power of music. \u201c\u2018On a Turntable\u2019 is partly about how whether things are good or bad in your life, there\u2019s always a song for what you\u2019re going through,\u201d Kevin points out. Meanwhile, on tracks like \u201cShe Got Arrested\u201d (a gritty look at the impact of domestic abuse) and \u201cJenny Drinks\u201d (a painfully detailed glimpse into the realities of addiction), The Interrupters shift perspective and bring some unforgettably poignant storytelling to their songwriting. \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout Say It Out Loud, The Interrupters also embed fiery social commentary into their lyrics, with \u201cBabylon\u201d calling on the people to \u201cconquer the system of control\u201d and \u201cMedia Sensation\u201d tearing apart media-controlled narratives. Another fierce meditation on media responsibility, \u201cPhantom City\u201d has Armstrong lending his vocals to a darkly charged take on today\u2019s constantly-plugged-in culture. And rounding out Say It Out Loud are a batch of feel-good songs proving The Interrupters\u2019 unstoppably upbeat spirit, from \u201cThe Prosecutor\u201d (\u201ca song about good conquering evil,\u201d according to Aimee) to \u201cThe Valley\u201d (a bouncing ode to the band\u2019s homeland) to \u201cYou\u2019re Gonna Find a Way Out\u201d (a rowdy anthem inspired by The Specials\u2019 \u201cA Message to You, Rudy\u201d and featuring Less Than Jake\u2019s Chris DeMakes, Roger Lima, Peter \u201cJR\u201d Wasilewski, and Buddy Schaub).\\r\\n\\r\\nForming The Interrupters in 2012, Aimee and the Bivonas first crossed paths when the brothers\u2019 former band Telacasters shared bills with her on a summer 2009 tour. Through the years\u2014in which they\u2019ve hit the road with bands like Rancid and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, in addition to taking the stage at such festivals as It\u2019s Not Dead and Soundwave\u2014The Interrupters have forged a\\r\\nformidable bond that deeply informs their music. \u201cLoyalty, family, friendship, and unity\u2014with upstrokes,\u201d says Kevin. \u201cThat pretty much sums up The Interrupters and what we are all about.\u201d\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1483},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":464},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":309},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-og.jpg\",\"width\":1000,\"height\":1545},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":155},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":773},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":1004},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/59-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://theinterruptersmusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/wearetheinterrupters\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Interruptweets\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Interruptweets\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1667787,\"name\":\"Left Alone\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"The exuberant yet repentant punk anthem that launches Left Alone's 2006 sophomore Hellcat offering is the kind of no bullshit, honest proclamation that fans of last year's highly-praised Lonely Starts and Broken Hearts have come to expect. That lead-off number, dubbed \\\"The Sinner\\\", is the sort of joyous chant along that has earned the devotion of punk purists throughout the globe. But as Dead American Radio unfolds, it reveals itself to be a far more adventurous, diverse and rewarding song cycle than its predecessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimply put, Left Alone has concocted a stone cold classic album that artfully takes aim at corporate radio, suck ass emo bands and everything in between while incorporating elements of ska, cowpunk, pop contagiousness and old school punk. Yet according to Left Alone's guitarist, songwriter and mouthpiece Elvis Cortez, that variety which counts the efforts of saxophonist Noe, and the inclusion of Hammond organ and pedal steel  wasn't necessarily a goal for the new disc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We were just picking up on different kinds of music and grooving on different elements,\\\" Cortez says. \\\"My only goal was to do a record I'd be 100% happy with. Lonely Stars was recorded in like four days or some shit. This time we had a lot of time. Plus we had been on tour forever and had a lot of songs. Everything just worked out. Much like our band, it's just a bunch of weird shit that just all kind of goes together.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a pensive heartbreaker like \\\"Waiting For You\\\" to the charged punk firecracker \\\"Drunk Again\\\", the flow of the record is somehow seamless thanks to the musical aptitude of Cortez, Noe and their rhythmic commando Ramrod (drums). With \\\"La Pregunta,\\\" recent tourmate Patricia Day (of HorrorPops fame) joins Elvis on the quirky ska-inspired, Spanish-sung duet, while Rancid's own Tim Armstrong joins forces with the band for the upbeat, rock & roll road tale \\\"City To City\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I brought some songs over for Tim to check out and he really liked \\\"City To City,\\\" so I asked him if he wanted to sing on it,\\\" Elvis says of his hit-worthy collaboration with Hellcat's founder. And he said, Yeah. So he wrote the verse he sings and he helped me arrange the song. He's so good at that kind of stuff. The guy is amazing in so many ways. It was a trip working with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf \\\"City To City\\\" is an instant classic that deserves to be an airwave favorite, Cortez recognizes that the likelihood that it and the other winners like on Dead American Radio  like the reflective, energetic \\\"Every Night\\\" and the terrestrial (a.k.a. testicle) radio critiquing title track  will be heard by the masses is slim. People think that bands get popular out of being good, and it's just not true, Elvis proclaims. I've always known it to be pretty much a money thing. It's like the rich gets richer and radio is the worst example of that. For a band it sucks because there's so much good stuff that should be on the radio but it never gets the chance because maybe their label can't afford it or just chooses not to buy into it. I've always felt that if a song is good enough, it shouldn't matter what label it's on, but that's not the way it works.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf corporate radio still sucks, Left Alone's frustrations with the medium haven't kept the quartet from excelling on Dead American Radio. It's funny because somehow these songs wound up being some of the catchiest I've ever written, Cortez marvels. And some of the songs ended up sounding like they could be at home on the radio. But I didn't sit down with that in mind. We just jam and then put the ideas together, it's never a plotted out thing with our music.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's amazing then, to consider that this big, bombastic sounding record was produced on a modest budget before mastering. A testament to Cortez's skills as a producer, he says the band just took our time and did what we always wanted to do. We did the drums on reel to reel analogue and dumped them into Pro Tools. I borrowed a Gretsch and a bunch of Les Pauls and different amps and cabinets. And Ramrod got a new, high end drum set and all of this equipment and we focused on the sound as much as the songs and it really worked out well.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf taking Left Alones music to a new level, Elvis acknowledges, We could do the whole hardcore thing, and I started with it, but I'm more about melody and textures. That's everything for me. We feel really good about this record. The whole band is excited. I can finally say that from start to finish, I feel so complete with this thing. It feels like we hit it out of the park. When I listen to the record we made, I'm like, Fuck yeah!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf defying convention seems to be protocol for Left Alone, Cortez confirms this notion when he speaks of a recent House of Blues gig in L.A. with Hellcat labelmates Tiger Army. We both had pedal steel guys! the frontman laughs. It's like totally out of context for punkers with Mohawks. The soundman was like, You have a saxophonist, a pedal steel player and an organist and you're a punk band with Mohawks? What are you guys doing?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut despite the group's willingness to try new things, the men of Left Alone are still ardent punk purists a disdain for a certain popular rock subgenre. Hence the delightful, revivalist kick in the ass known as I Hate Emo.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 2004 Warped Tour it started for us,Elvis confesses. It was like attack of the clones. Emo bands they look the same, they play the same, they talk the same. So the song started as a punk rock song called Fuck Emo. And the chorus was like, Yeah, I said it. I said it. And then we did the Warped Tour Barbecue and all these emo bands would look at me like I was an asshole. And maybe I was.\\r\\n\\r\\nI guess with me, I don't give a fuck what music looks like or how it's packaged,Elvis says, in spite of his band's own eye-catching Boombox-centric album cover. As long as its good and genuine, it will shine through and people will catch on. If you play your shit with balls, and truly have some balls, it will shine through.\\r\\n\\r\\nSumming it all up, Elvis Cortez decrees, We're no Hot Topic band. That's for sure.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":683,\"height\":1024},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":450},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":300},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-og.jpg\",\"width\":683,\"height\":1024},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":150},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":750},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":975},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/22/78/37-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.leftalonemusic.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/leftalonepunx\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/leftalonepunks\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1667789,\"name\":\"Bad Cop Bad Cop\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\u201cShove your labels / we\u2019ll flip your tables / and we won\u2019t apologize / for causing a scene.\u201d \u2013 Bad Cop/Bad Cop, My Life\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lyric above is essentially a mission statement for Bad Cop/Bad Cop, who prove that the best way to battle sexist stereotypes about women in bands is to play well, and to play hard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith catchy hooks, three part harmonies, and a drummer who fires her guns harder than most of her male compatriots, Bad Cop/Bad Cop bring to mind the \u201890s heyday of chicks who actually rocked, from the snarl of The Distillers and synchronized vocals of Dance Hall Crashers to the guitar prowess of The Muffs and wry lyrics of Lunachicks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll hailing from different parts of the U.S., the foursome met in Los Angeles while playing in bands like Compton SF, The Radio Sweetheart, The D\u2019Maggs, The City, Angry Amputees, and Cunt Sparrer.

Bad Cop/Bad Cop are looking forward to the release of their first full-length album, produced by Fat Mike, out on Fat Wreck Chords 2015.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":960},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":200},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":500},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":650},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/24/06/57-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1669893,\"name\":\"Johnny Madcap and The Distractions\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"L.A. singer, songwriter Johnny Madcap, formerly of the punk rock band Madcap, (Side one Dummy, Victory Records), has formed a new rock and roll outfit called Johnny Madcap and The Distractions. The Distractions, a group of low slung, \\\"guitar slinger\\\" types are the perfect compliment to Johnny's raw pop sensablities. Together, Johnny and the band are simply obsessed with one thing, - turning their shows into full-blown parties. Dancing, singing, shouting and carrying on like the world may end tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the past year, Johnny Madcap and the Distractions have been hard at work recording and releasing records, filming videos and performing with such notable bands as The Bouncing Souls, Youth Brigade, Missing Persons and Eddie and The Hotrods. With 2 records released in 2011, EP \u2013 \\\"Let's Get Lost\\\" & LP \\\"Last Man Dancing\\\" available on Itunes, the band shows no signs of slowing down. \\\"Goodbye Michelle,\\\" \\\"On the Radio\\\" and, \\\"American Gossip\\\" are just some of the many songs that will have you almost instantly singing along and moving to the beat.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne listen and you won't be able to help but feel as if you've known this band your whole life. On stage and on record, Johnny Madcap and The Distractions conjure up sounds and images reminiscent of the days when pop music straddled New Wave, Punk and Pub Rock. With a dash of Tom Petty, a slice of Elvis Costello, a pinch of The Plimsouls and a handful of L.A. street wise rock and roll, this band will take your heart and soul to musically sublime places you have always wanted them to be.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":604,\"height\":552},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":274},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":183},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-og.jpg\",\"width\":604,\"height\":552},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":91},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":457},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":604,\"height\":552},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/23/05/85-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/distractyou\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/1234distractions/\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/JohnnyMadcap\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"JohnnyMadcap\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1282115?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
