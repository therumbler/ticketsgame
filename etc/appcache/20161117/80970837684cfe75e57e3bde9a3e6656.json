Myers\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"WHISKEY MYERS\\r\\nIt would be an understatement to say that a lot has happened since Whiskey Myers was\\r\\nlast in the recording studio. Over two whirlwind years, the gritty Texas band hit #1 on\\r\\nthe iTunes Country Chart with their breakout third album 'Early Morning Shakes,'\\r\\nearned raves everywhere from Rolling Stone to USA Today, and toured the US and UK\\r\\nrelentlessly, slaying massive festival crowds and sharing stages with Lynyrd Skynyrd,\\r\\nHank Williams Jr., Jamey Johnson, and more along the way. You'd be forgiven, then,\\r\\nfor expecting things to work a little differently this time around when the band\\r\\nreunited with acclaimed producer Dave Cobb for their stellar new album, 'Mud.' But as\\r\\nit turns out, success doesn't change a Southern gentleman, and they don't come any\\r\\nmore Southern than Whiskey Myers.\\r\\nFueled by larger-than-life performances honed tight from countless nights on the road,\\r\\n'Mud' finds the band scaling new heights of songwriting and musicianship, with searing\\r\\nguitars, soulful vocals, and indelible hooks. While their approach to the music and\\r\\nhumble, hard-working attitudes may not have altered, there have been developments\\r\\nin the Whiskey Myers world, most notably with the arrival of new faces. For the\\r\\nrecording sessions, the band's five founding members\u2014Cody Cannon on lead vocals and\\r\\nguitar, Cody Tate and John Jeffers on guitars, Gary Brown on bass, and Jeff Hogg on\\r\\ndrums\u2014fleshed out their sound with the addition of fiddler/keyboard player Jon\\r\\nKnudson and percussionist Tony Kent, who are both now full-time members.\\r\\n\\\"They bring a great energy, and I think it's really helped our sound and makes the band\\r\\nmore versatile,\\\" explains Cannon. \\\"There's less room onstage now, but sometimes a\\r\\nfamily grows.\\\"\\r\\nA glance through Whiskey Myers' lyrics will show you that Cannon is a man who chooses\\r\\nhis words carefully, so it's little surprise that he describes the band as a family. The\\r\\ntight-knit group's roots stretch back decades into the red dirt of East Texas, where\\r\\nCannon, Jeffers, and Tate first began playing together before rounding out their initial\\r\\nlineup with the addition Hogg and Brown (who is Cannon's actual cousin). They built up\\r\\na rabid local following on the strength of their 2008 debut album, 'Road Of Life,' and\\r\\nthen notched their first #1 on the Texas Music Charts with their 2011 follow-up\\r\\n'Firewater.' It was 'Early Morning Shakes,' though, that introduced the rest of the world\\r\\nto what Texas already knew. The album cracked the Top 10 on the Billboard Country\\r\\nChart, a remarkable feat for a fiercely independent band and a testament to their\\r\\nrigorous DIY work ethic and endless supply of passion and drive. Esquire called them\\r\\n\\\"the real damn deal,\\\" while Country Weekly said they combine \\\"greasy Southern rock\\r\\nriffs with countrified songwriting and Texas grit for something wholly unique,\\\" and\\r\\nPlayboy dubbed them \\\"the new bad boys of country music.\\\"\\r\\nEven in the face of their rapidly-growing profile and expanding lineup, the band found\\r\\nthey were able to pick up exactly where they left off when they returned to the studio\\r\\nfor 'Mud.'\\r\\n\\\"We don\u2019t want a high stress situation, and we don\u2019t want to feel uncomfortable while\\r\\nwe're recording, because we want to make sure everybody can get into their creative\\r\\nmode,\\\" explains Brown. \\\"Dave has a laid back attitude as far as making music and that\\r\\nfits right in with the way we work. His ear is similar to ours and he has the same kind\\r\\nof vision for what the music should sound like.\\\"\\r\\nWhat the music sounds like is raw, visceral emotion: pride, faith, desire, defiance. The\\r\\nsongs on 'Mud' are stories of ordinary men and women standing up for their families \\r\\nand honoring their roots. Home is sacred ground for Whiskey Myers, not just a plot of\\r\\nland, but rather the cornerstone of an identity worth dying for. Fiddle-led album\\r\\nopener \\\"On The River\\\" steps back to frontier times when the struggle for survival was a\\r\\ndaily one, while the epic title track promises a home-foreclosing banker \\\"Ain\u2019t no man\\r\\ngonna take it away / Because it's deep down in my blood / So step across the ol'\\r\\nproperty line / And you\u2019ll die right here in the mud.\\\" \\\"Frogman,\\\" written with Rich\\r\\nRobinson of the Black Crowes, follows a Southern man halfway around the world, as he\\r\\nrisks his life to defend freedom and fight terror in the Middle East as a Navy Seal, and\\r\\nthe Darrell Scott co-write \\\"Trailer We Call Home\\\" finds the beauty in simple things,\\r\\nconcluding, \\\"Times get tough but love is strong / Here in this trailer that we call\\r\\nhome.\\\"\\r\\n\\\"Where you come from and where you grew up influences your music a lot,\\\" says\\r\\nCannon. \\\"As a band, we don't go into the studio with any preconceived theme. You just\\r\\nsit down and you write and the songs come out naturally.\\\"\\r\\nAs a result, Whiskey Myers' music fits neatly into no genre. Sure, it's heavily influenced\\r\\nby country music (\\\"My first record was 'The Pressure Is On' / Ain\u2019t it funny how your life\\r\\ncan change with a song\\\" Cannon sings on \\\"Hank\\\"), but the band credits everything from\\r\\nAlan Jackson and Waylon Jennings to Led Zeppelin and Nirvana as inspiration. \\\"Some\\r\\nOf Your Love\\\" channels old-school soul, while the bright, punchy horns of \\\"Lightning\\r\\nBugs And Rain\\\" flirts with Rolling Stones swagger, and \\\"Good Ole' Days\\\" captures a\\r\\nstripped-down, folky vibe, as the whole band sat in a circle singing together live. It all\\r\\nadds up to what Cannon perhaps describes best as \\\"no frills, no bullshit rock and roll.\\\"\\r\\n\\\"The equipment we used on the recording process for this one was really important to\\r\\nthe sound, too\\\" he adds. \\\"Dave has these amazing old amps and we recorded\\r\\neverything to tape for the first time. The piano was from, like, 1904 or something, and\\r\\nI don't think it's been tuned since. Little things like that make a big difference. It\\r\\nsounds authentic when you actually use the real, old gear.\\\"\\r\\nIn the end, there may be no better word for Whiskey Myers than authentic. This music\\r\\nis in their blood, and it flows as naturally from them as a spring feeding a mountain\\r\\ncreek. While a record this good is sure to send their (lone)star rising higher than ever\\r\\nbefore, you can rest assured that success still won't be changing this band any time\\r\\nsoon. They make music they're proud of that celebrates where they come from and\\r\\nmakes people feel good. As far as they're concerned, that's all the success anyone\\r\\ncould ever ask for.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/29/80/79-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://whiskeymyers.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/whiskeymyersmusic\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/whiskeymyers\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/whiskeymyers\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"whiskeymyers\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":288097,\"name\":\"Scooter Brown Band\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"History \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 4 years and 3 months, 2 tours overseas with 1 tour of combat in Iraq as a United States Marine, Scott Brown traded his guns in for guitars and hit the road.
