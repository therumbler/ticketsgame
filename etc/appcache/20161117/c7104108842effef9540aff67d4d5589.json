As a singer, songwriter and producer, he stands alone\u2014an artist immune to corruption.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDug deep into the rich soil of American music, Cope\u2019s roots are complex you may think of Bill Withers or Neil Young or John Lee Hooker or Van Morrison or Willie Nelson or Al Green. Yet, listening to Cope, you also may think of none of the above. You may not think at all, but rather feel a man exposing stories that haunt his heart.\\r\\nHe was born Clarence Greenwood, a child of the seventies, and his life journey is as singular as his art. He is the radically mashed-up product of Greenville, Mississippi; Memphis, Tennessee; Vernon, Texas; Austin, Texas; Washington, DC; and Brooklyn, New York. These locations are felt everywhere in his stories. His sounds are southern rural, big sky lonely, concrete urban, and painfully romantic.\\r\\nIn the past nine years, he has produced four albums of depth and distinction, each a critical chapter in his search for a sound that paints an auditory American landscape in which despair wars with hope and hope, tied to love, is elusive.\\r\\nCope\u2019s musical education was catch-as-catch can. Folk tales\u2014whether through William Faulkner or Big Bill Broonzy\u2014shaped his sensitivity. A few college courses at Texas Tech alternately bored and excited him. In the Austin of the eighties, he took sound classes and found himself fooling with a primitive four-track setup. Turntables intrigued him. He heard hip hop as inspired invention. For years, he got lost in his self-designed lab, cooking up beats and motifs that only later would be shaped into songs.\\r\\nIn the midst of the squalor, grandeur, and hypocrisy of the nation\u2019s capitol, Cope set up camp. Vocalist Michel Ivey recruited him as a mad scientist who feverishly concocted samples for the artsy-edgy configuration known as Basehead. As the group hit the road, Cope stayed in the background, moving dials and pushing buttons. Inside his head, he heard stories that still had not assumed full form.\\r\\nThe long night of gestation got even longer. Finally, as the songs gave birth, Cope assumed others would sing them. He had sculpted certain stories and developed certain sounds. As a serious artist with no interest in rock star glory, Cope presumed he\u2019d eventually find the right voice to sing his songs.\\r\\nThe right voice was found. By playing in local venues, the writer/producer ultimately met the only singer equipped to narrate the idiosyncratic stories. That voice resided within his own soul. The writer/producer/singer were one, living inside the wide confines of Cope\u2019s vision.\\r\\nOn record the vision is first expressed in Citizen Cope, the debut album from 2002. The artist is still finding his footing and, although his trademark poetry is firmly in place, this is the only record where the production isn\u2019t entirely his own. The aural environment is more elaborate, the sound not yet reduced down to the common denominator that we come to know as Cope. The theme, though, is clear\u2014it\u2019s \u201cContact,\u201d the cry for a connection to a world that is at once bewildering, necessary, and fraudulent. The issues are serious. \u201cYou\u2019ve got them crooked politicians,\u201d he writes, \u201ceating up the treasury and taking our cash to spend on the prisons while the youth they fast.\u201d The groove is insistent. \u201cLet the Drummer Kick\u201d is the name of the song that says, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to bust through\u2026mass confusion, solution, conclusion, inspiration is what pulls you through.\u201d Busting through, pulling through, getting through to \u201cSalvation,\u201d a story in which Judas shows up in DC and takes aim at the singer\u2019s soul.\\r\\nCitizen Cope introduces us to a world of musical worry that doesn\u2019t come fully into focus until his second album, The Clarence Greenwood Recordings (2004), which, together with his next two records, form a masterful trilogy. Emotional confusion and musical coherence sit side by side. The \u201cContact\u201d Cope has been searching for is found, but it isn\u2019t easily maintained. The effort to maintain contact keeps us moving into the heart of the mystery, the strangeness of the stories, the lull of the sound.With The Clarence Greenwood Recordings, the sound is stripped of any excess. At the same time, the sound is as big as it needs to be\u2014injected with an urgency that, in the words of the most celebrated song from the album, examines the world \u201cSideways.\u201d \u201cSideways\u201d caught the attention of Carlos Santana who covered it and asked Cope to perform with him during a European tour.\\r\\nGreenwood is the first of the fully mature Cope statements where, by attaining control in the studio, he can riff on the uncontrollable universe in which we live. The opening line of the opening song\u2014\u201cthings have been getting heavy these days\u201d\u2014sets the scene. Cope finds his groove that, with only slight variations, will fuel his tales of seeking hope in hell. The groove becomes a mantra and the mantra, sung in a voice that is both disarmingly sincere and studiously ironic, stops us in our tracks. Cope tracks the relationship between terror, fantasy and reality.\\r\\n\u201cPablo Picasso,\u201d for example, is a portrait of a \u201cforty feet tall\u201d woman who requires defense from the law. Her defender is the poet, the singer, the \u201cwild man.\u201d \u201cThey say a wild man is defending his lady, but for some odd reason, they calling you a painting.\u201d\\r\\nArt requires defense. Without art, we can\u2019t cope. But Cope\u2019s art isn\u2019t the high art of elitism; it\u2019s the low art of funk. It\u2019s the art that paints a penitentiary on fire; the art the gets you through hurricane waters yet puts you between the bullet and target. The voice of the singer\u2014as messy as it precise, as eloquent as it is enigmatic\u2014is half-hoarse, half-hilarious, wholly hypnotic.\\r\\nEvery Waking Moment (2006) is more self-reflection, sly personal and political analysis projected in another suite of free-wheeling stories. Hooks, repeating motifs, and iron-clad choruses anchor the primal production. Cope makes it easy on your ears and demanding on your mind. The heat\u2019s turned up\u2014\u201cit\u2019s 107 degrees\u201d\u2014and the love is \u201cseven feet deep.\u201d\\r\\nQuestions are not resolved in The Rainwater LP (2010). More questions are encouraged. \u201cKeep Askin\u2019,\u201d says the song. A \u201cLifeline\u201d is offered, but not explained. Cope cops to his limitations: \u201cI forgot what the wise man said about that ancient threat.\u201d The thread is about survival, the realization of romance, the hope for reconciliation, the strain to connect father and son, life and death, heaven and hell.\\r\\nWhile making records over the past decade, Cope has wrestled with a number of record companies. They have loved him, rejected him, readopted him, and ignored him. Listening to his uncompromised songs\u2014to the tough integrity in his voice\u2014it\u2019s not surprising to learn that he hasn\u2019t hesitated to go over the heads of the music execs. From the get-go, he has taken his case to the people. He has toured tirelessly. He has brought his stories\u2014with a band or simply with his guitar\u2014to whatever venue would have him. His motivation to make music directly in front of people, so matter the size of the crowd, has won his a vast audience in America and abroad. As a troubadour, he has prospered, relentlessly criss-crossing the land, his songs in his back pocket.\\r\\nIn fact, with The Rainwater LP, his self-reliance has been realized in the form of his own independent label. Citizen Cope is a self-realized musical/poetic/production entity. In that sense, his Americanism is profound. His approach is radical. He\u2019s a rebel in the tough tradition of Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. He wanders through the woods alone. His accountability is to his own heart, his own values and vision.\\r\\nCope\u2019s a one-man band, trying to make sense of all the nonsense that marks the 21st Century.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":672},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":210},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":140},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1435},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":70},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":350},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":455},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/64/86/17-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.citizencope.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/citizencope\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/citizencope\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/citizencope\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"citizencope\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.aladdin-theater.com/event/1364419?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
