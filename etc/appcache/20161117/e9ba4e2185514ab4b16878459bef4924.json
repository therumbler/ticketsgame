Horton Heat\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Undeniably, The Reverend Horton Heat, aka Jim Heath, is the biggest, baddest, grittiest, greasiest, greatest rocker that ever piled his hair up and pounded the drinks down. Without question, for all of his outlandish antics, blistering stage performances and legendary musical prowess, the one thing The Rev always gets asked about is the story behind his unusual and rather clerical moniker. \\\"Well, there used to be this guy who ran this place in Deep Ellum, Texas who used to call me Horton- my last name is Heath,\\\" says The Rev. \\\"Anyway, this guy hired me and right before the show he goes, 'Your stage name should be Reverend Horton Heat! Your music is like gospel' and I thought it was pretty ridiculous. So I'm up there playing and after the first few songs, people are saying, 'Yeah, Reverend!' What's really funny is that this guy gave up the bar business, and actually became a preacher! Now he comes to our shows and says, 'Jim, you really should drop this whole Reverend thing.'\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's been an almost 20-year journey for Heath, whose country-flavored punkabilly and onstage antics have brought him and his band a strikingly diverse fan base and a devoted cult following, not to mention the respect of fellow musicians worldwide. Revival, the band's first release for Yep Roc Records, is a return to Heath's roots - musical and geographical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album was recorded at Last Beat Studio in the Deep Ellum area of Dallas, just a block from where The Rev played his first gig and next door to where the group currently rehearses. Along with eating a lot of world-class Mexican food and BBQ, the band recorded the album's 15 tracks with a minimum of overdubs, bells and whistles. With tour manager/engineer Dave Allen at the board, they wanted an album they could duplicate live.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I got this lick called the 'hurricane,' and I call back on the hurricane on this album for the sake of keeping things really rockin,\\\" he says. (The \\\"hurricane\\\" is a trademark lick where The Rev plays lead and rhythm guitar simultaneously to give the trio its full live sound.) He's also got a top-secret lick he'll introduce on this disc. It's so top secret that he won't even divulge the name, but listen up for it! Lyrically, the album's themes run \\\"from death to silliness,\\\" says The Rev, who lost his mother earlier this year. \\\"I'd been going through so much stuff, losing my mom so quickly, new baby, touring, getting back and having to work,\\\" he says of making the album. Revival finds the Rev dealing with these issues and more: The track \\\"Someone in Heaven\\\" is written for his mother, while \\\"Indigo Friends\\\" deals with a friend's heroin addiction. But the album's themes aren't only dark and/or serious: \\\"Calling in Twisted\\\" is about calling in sick to work and \\\"using the fake cough,\\\" \\\"Rumble Strip\\\" is a truck drivin song and \\\"If it Ain't got Rhythm\\\", \\\"that's a really fun one to play,\\\" says the Rev \\\"it is classic RHH. And \\\"Party Mad\\\" is pretty self-explanatory.\\r\\n\\r\\nReunited with legendary producer/engineer Ed Stasium, who mixed the album, Revival is a 40-plus minute slab of rockabilly, blues, R&B that shows an artist - and a band - in their prime. It's true that the Reverend Horton Heat have been called a great many things over the course of their storied career: Perpetual Carriers Of The Rockabilly Flame, Genre-Shattering Shit-Starters, Filthy Drunks, and The Most Electrifying Live Act In America (150 shows every year can't be wrong) among them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I think it's cool we've lasted this long,\\\" says The Rev. \\\"People still come out to see us play after all these years and all the shows and tours. It's amazing. I mean, I get to sing songs about cars I love, drinking and chasing girls. Beats the hell out of the alternative.\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":676},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":211},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":141},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1442},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":70},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":352},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":458},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/35/42/03-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"H96XcNWKZVg\",\"title\":\"Reverend Horton Heat - Let Me Teach You How To Eat\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H96XcNWKZVg\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H96XcNWKZVg\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.reverendhortonheat.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/reverendhortonheat\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/reverendhortonheat\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/revhortonheat\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"revhortonheat\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1457049,\"name\":\"Supersuckers\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"You've heard our name, you've seen our records, our t-shirts and our stickers. We're probably the favorite band of someone you know and yet we're still a mystery to you. Well my friend, that's okay, I'm here to fill you in and help you to get to know the greatest rock-n-roll band in the world, The Supersuckers.\\n\\nOur story is almost impossible to believe. This band is literally a human cartoon. We all grew up among the dead-ends and cactus needles of Tucson, Arizona and have known each other since grade school. We graduated from the same high school together at the same time (a school immortalized in our song \\\"Santa Rita High\\\") and we chose to play in a band together because we liked to hang out together, not because we were great musicians or anything. I truly believe that a band is defined by their limitations, that what they can't (or won't) do is just as important as what they can do. I guess that, in this era of pre-fabricated, put-together-to-have-a-hit bands, we're kind of an aberration and I gotta tell ya that that makes us smile a little every day.\\n\\nWe formed the band in 1988 and we were initially a five piece called The Black Supersuckers ( a name found in some quality \\\"adult literature\\\" we had laying around in our impeccably clean band house!), with me on bass, Dan \\\"Thunder\\\" Bolton and Rontrose Heathman on guitars, Dancing Eagle on drums and a lead singer by the name of Eric Martin. After firmly proving ourselves to be the best band in town we decided it was time to get out of Tucson and try our luck somewhere else. So we tossed a coin with heads as New Orleans and tails as Seattle. Tails it was and in May of \\\"89 we packed up and went north.\\n\\nWe had no idea that Seattle was about to become \\\"Rock Mecca USA\\\", we just wanted to go somewhere where we could wear our leather jackets a little more often. It was exciting and encouraging to see all of the great bands there, doing their own thing and making some kick-ass, aggressive rock-n-roll that we could relate to, so we started recording immediately. After some classic \\\"creative differences\\\" with our lead singer, we decided to try it as a four piece with yours truly as the singer (I was the only one who knew all the words) and The Supersuckers, as you may or may not know them today, were born.\\n\\nOur first recordings as a four-piece wound up on various singles for small labels and then were compiled for a C.D. called The Songs All Sound The Same. (For the full story on these recordings I highly recommend picking up the re-issued version on our own label, Mid-Fi Recordings). But it was our live shows that caught the eyes of the good people at Sub-Pop Records and, after a particularly scorching show one night, they offered to put out our records. We said ,\\\"Buy us some beer and you got a deal!\\\" And our long and enduring rock-n-roll ride was officially under way.\\n\\nStarting with 1992,s \\\"The Smoke Of Hell\\\", we released a total of three rock records, one country record, split singles with Steve Earle and The Rev. Horton Heat, countless singles and a \\\"best-of\\\" double album (all on Sub-Pop,) then we put out what is considered to be our finest recorded moment to date \\\"The Evil Powers Of Rock-n-Roll\\\"(Koch/Aces & Eights) in late 1999. We've also been touring our asses off all over the world with bands like Mudhoney, Social Distortion, Bad Religion, The Ramones, Motorhead, The Toadies, The Butthole Surfers, The Reverend Horton Heat, The Dwarves and White Zombie. We've played a couple of Farm Aid shows and backed Willie Nelson on The Tonight Show. Our music has appeared in T.V. shows (Beverly Hills 90210), Movies (Baseketball, Hype) and commercials (Mountain Dew) as well as countless snow and skateboarding video compilations.\\n\\nThroughout this entire time, our sole mission has been to create and perform timeless, quality music and get as many people as possible to hear it. That goal has never changed. The pursuit of that perfectly imperfect rock-n-roll moment is all we've ever been after. We've been doing this for well over a decade now and we're just getting started.\\n\\n2001 found us starting our own label; Mid-Fi Recordings. We've finally decided to take control of all of our affairs and have become a lean, mean, self managed, totally independent rock-n-roll machine. We've got the greatest fans in the world and no one cares more about them and our music than we do. Having our own label gives us the freedom to make more of our music available to them without the hassles of \\\"the middle-man\\\" worrying about things like \\\"marketing\\\" or \\\"demographics\\\". Hell, these are just hard words. All we want to do is get some kick-ass music out to the people and with Mid-Fi we have been able to do just that. Our first release was a live country record entitled \\\"Must've Been Live\\\", that came out in March, 2002. Since then, we have dug into our \\\"private reserves\\\" and released several singles of some our finest outtake stock (a habit we intend to keep). We're also planning some split singles with other great artists, the first one being \\\"Never Go Home\\\" by The Hangmen b/w \\\"Flyin' Into The Mid-Day Sun\\\" by the 'suckers.\\n\\nBut, by far the most exciting thing we're doing now is gearing up for the release of our new rock record, Motherfuckers Be Trippin'. It's the perfect follow up to The Evil Powers Of Rock-N-Roll and will be available to rock your ass on April 22, 2003. We feel better about this record than any we've done to date, which is amazing for a band that has been around as long as we have, and we know you'll dig it as much as we do. It truly seems like we're just getting the hang of this music making thing!\\n\\nSo, the next time you see The Supersuckers name, whether it's in the record store or on the marquee at your local nightclub, know that there's some quality, honest, ass-kicking, hard working individuals in there, trying to make your life a little better through the \\\"Evil Powers Of Rock-n-Roll\\\" (and the occasional detour into the country of course) and we'd love nothing better than to have you there with us. Just remember to wear you clean underwear, because we're gonna rock your pants right off of you.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":289},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":289},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":173},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":173},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":116},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":116},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-og.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":289},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":58},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":58},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":289},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":289},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":289},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/94/48/95-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":289}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.supersuckers.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/supersuckers\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Supersuckers/135339756866\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/SupersuckersRnR\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"SupersuckersRnR\"},{\"id\":1491389,\"name\":\"Shotgun Hodown\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Shotgun Hodown, a soon to be legendary band from the high-desert of western Colorado.
