Calum and David are two of the most melodic and cutting-edge rhythm players active on the London jazz scene today, perfects partners in the exploration of Monk's music.\\n\\nThelonious are delighted to be playing the Vortex downstairs Cafe every second Sunday in the month after the London Jazz Orchestra, from 6pm to 8pm\",\"artists\":[{\"name\":\"Thelonious\",\"mbid\":null,\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/5241016.jpeg\",\"thumb_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/5241016.jpeg\",\"facebook_tour_dates_url\":\"http://www.bandsintown.com/Thelonious/facebookapp?came_from=67\",\"facebook_page_url\":null,\"tracker_count\":253,\"url\":\"Thelonious\",\"website\":null}],\"venue\":{\"name\":\"Vortex\",\"place\":\"Vortex\",\"city\":\"London\",\"region\":\"United Kingdom\",\"country\":\"United Kingdom\",\"latitude\":51.50737,\"longitude\":-0.087914}}]\n",
