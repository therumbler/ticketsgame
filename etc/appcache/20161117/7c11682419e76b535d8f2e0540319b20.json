Snider\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"FORGET THE WATOOSI, AND THE BUGALOO FORGET THE SHAG AND THE SHAKE AND THE SHUFFLE TOO FORGET ABOUT THE MONKEY AND THE MASHED POTATO EVERYBODY'S DOING THAT FUNKY TOMATO\\r\\nTodd Snider\\r\\nYou don\u2019t expect barrelhouse boogie woogie, straight up garage rock or power pop from the ratchety voice who gave you \u201cTalkin\u2019 Seattle Grunge Rock Blues,\u201d the iconic East Nashville Skyline or the Great American Taxi-backed Time As We Know It: The Songs of Jerry Jeff Walker. Yet fresh from fronting the freewheeling social commentary of the jam-meets-Tom Petty Hard Working Americans \u2013 featuring Widespread Panic\u2019s Dave Schools and Chris Robinson Brotherhood\u2019s Neal Casal \u2013 Todd Snider\u2019s Eastside Bulldog suggests there\u2019s a new kinda rumble under the hood of the iconoclastic troubadour.\\r\\n\u201cI think if you work so hard to be taken seriously, you\u2019ve missed the rock and roll,\u201d Snider says with a wry smile, equal parts Shakespeare\u2019s Puck and naughty teenager. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with uptempo and positive? This is Saturday night: crank it up when you\u2019re ready to go out, drive too fast, get yer ya-yas out. Just let it go, and dive in -- and get rockin\u2019.\u201d\\r\\nRandom notions sunk into the East Nashville soil when the cabin-fevered folkie would spend time at home. Knowing you can\u2019t saturate the market, he\u2019d call up friends like Elizabeth Cook and Kevin Gordon, and hit various bars under the moniker Elmo Buzz & the Bulldogs. The randy, rousing group \u2013 \u201ckinda like the Rolling Thunder Review, with horns and girls\u201d \u2013 quickly became a hipster\u2019s favorite, mating Jerry Lee Lewis\u2019 fraught rock with the Kingsmen\u2019s swing\u2019n soul.\\r\\nNever intended as more than a local kick-out-the-carbons joyride, the Bulldog buzz infected more than East Nashville\u2019s 5 Points neighborhood. A day of recording with Emmylou Harris\u2019 steelman/original Mavericks\u2019 producer Steve Fishell \u2013 for a master class he runs \u2013 captured the combustion and kinetics in a way that merged crazed music lovers, alcohol and freewheeling musicians.\\r\\nBut it wasn\u2019t until manager Burt Stein encouraged Snider to take his Dogs to Cash Cabin to try and catch lightning in a studio one more time that the music from the \u201cmythic\u201d Elmo Buzz, the never-made-it bar-rocker whose schtick the Peace Queer creator \u201cstole,\u201d was crystalized, and was finally committed to tape. Eastside Bulldog is romp, a stomp and one hell of a party.\\r\\n\u201cThis,\u201d Snider enthuses, \u201cis the afterparty after the party.\u201d\\r\\nFrom the Bo Diddley grindhouse bully smackdown \u201cEnough Is Enough\u201d to the freewheeling \u201cSecret Agent Man\u201d-style pep club rally \u201cEastside Bulldogs,\u201d the bass heavy, horn squonking instrumental \u201cBocephus\u201d that evokes the Champs\u2019 \u201cTequila\u201d with its own feverish cry of Hank Williams Jr\u2019s nickname to the Fats Domino meets Little Richard rager \u201c37206,\u201d which proclaims \u201cI got the tshirt \u2013 and the bumper sticker,\u201d this is Snider unbridled.\\r\\n\u201cWe\u2019re kinda like the Kingsmen: they\u2019re always blazing and they barely make it when the vocal kicks in. Like the end of the solo on \u2018Louie, Louie,\u2019 that\u2019s my favorite musical moment ever... Because just when you think it\u2019s all gonna fall apart, it comes together and explodes. It\u2019s so good!\u201d\\r\\nOne listen to the careening refrain of \u201dchicks and cars and partying hard,\u201d with Jen Gunderman\u2019s pumping piano and Snider\u2019s slamming surf guitar on the\\r\\n \\r\\nmusic business skewering \u201cHey, Pretty Boy,\u201d it\u2019s obvious that spun-out fishtailing is where it\u2019s at for the man whose writing\u2019s been hailed by John Prine, Jimmy Buffett, Kris Kristofferson, Keith Sykes and Guy Clark. Snider sees no compromise or contradiction in these euphoria-pumping party songs.\\r\\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a deeper thing: If you don\u2019t think \u2018Whomp Bop A Lu Bop\u2019 is genius, you\u2019re missing it. As a person in folk, I think \u2018Sha na NA na NA\u2019 or a bunch of \u2018shadoobies\u2019 are the lyric that\u2019s got it! \u2018Tuttti Frutti\u2019 is deeper than \u2018Blowin\u2019 In The Wind,\u2019 even as the guy who wishes he\u2019d written \u2018Blowin\u2019 In The Wind.\u2019 It says more about everything, love, rage, sex \u2013 all of it.\u201d\\r\\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that Snider\u2019s current cavalcade of songs includes the barbed-wire surf guitar strewn trog-pop \u201cAre You With Me,\u201d the burlesque-y churn and shuffle of \u201cCome On Up\u201d in full carny barker exhortation or the farfisa power- pop pogo delight of \u201cWays & Means,\u201d which invokes \u201cPrivate Eyes\u201d songwriter Warren Pash\u2019s cash. Even the cacophony meets freefalling \u201cCheck It Out\u201d suggests a meth-addled percussive-driven \u201cLand of a 1000 Dances.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole idea: it\u2019s the opposite of what you expect from me. But I like songs that say, \u2018Hey, baby, let\u2019s rock and roll..,\u2019 especially more than once. I like there\u2019s lotsa spots to yell. I like that the whole record is over in less than half an hour \u2013 and it\u2019s all fun!\\r\\n\u201cI hope my artsy fartsy friends can hear this and like it. For some people, if it\u2019s not super-serious and talking about the things they think they should worry about, then it\u2019s not art. But you know, the real art is stuff that makes you feel!\\r\\n\u201cYou listen to this, and it\u2019s not going to matter \u2013 as long as it\u2019s tonight! And ALL night! As long as my baby\u2019s with me, and we\u2019re getting it, and...\u201d\\r\\nSnider almost runs out of breath. He\u2019s fired up. He\u2019s ready to party. And for the man who\u2019s the post-modern troubadour state-of-the-world pulse taker, it\u2019s simple. \u201cThis is genuinely my political statement to the world: if you ask me about the election or the state of the world, I\u2019m like Our Party is \u2013 We Party Balls! Turn It Up, Man! We\u2019re Doomed; Let\u2019s Dance!\\r\\n\u201cOh, and all those kick ass, wicked sweet leads? Those are my wicked sweet kick ass leads for the first time! I play about as good as a kid in high school \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\\r\\nSo as the sax bleats and sweats, the tempo bunches and catches, kick off your shoes and drop your center of gravity. For Snider, it\u2019s just thus. Get your \u201cFunky Tomato\u201d and go.\\r\\nPUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR,\\r\\nDO NOT RESIST ARREST\\r\\nNOW SHAKE YOUR DARE-EE-AIR FROM EAST TO WEST\\r\\nLIKE YOU KNOW EAST IS BEST\\r\\nNOW PUT YOUR HANDS OUT WIDE AND TRY TO TOUCH YOUR NOSE 'CUZ IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT\\r\\nYOU CAN'T DRIVE HOME\\r\\nBUT NOW YOU GOT IT,LOOK AT YOU GO NOW YOU\u2019RE DOING THAT FUNKY TOMATO\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":694,\"height\":645},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":279},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":186},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-og.png\",\"width\":694,\"height\":645},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":93},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":465},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atxl1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atxxl.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":604},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/60-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.toddsnider.net/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/toddsnider\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/toddsnider\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/todd_snider\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"todd_snider\"},{\"id\":1773050,\"name\":\"Robert Earl Keen\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\\\"The road goes on forever ...\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's not always easy to sum up a career \u2014 let alone a life's ambition \u2014 so succinctly, but those five words from Robert Earl Keen's calling-card anthem just about do it. You can complete the lyric with the next five words \u2014 the ones routinely shouted back at Keen by thousands of fans a night (\\\"and the party never ends!\\\") \u2014 just to punctuate the point with a flourish, but it's the part about the journey that gets right to the heart of what makes Keen tick. Some people take up a life of playing music with the goal of someday reaching a destination of fame and fortune; but from the get-go, Keen just wanted to write and sing his own songs, and to keep writing and singing them for as long as possible. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I always thought that I wanted to play music, and I always knew that you had to get some recognition in order to continue to play music,\\\" Keen says. \\\"But I never thought of it in terms of getting to be a big star. I thought of it in terms of having a really, really good career and writing some good songs, and getting onstage and having a really good time.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow three-decades on from the release of his debut album \u2014 with well over a dozen other records to his name, thousands of shows under his belt and still no end in sight to the road ahead \u2014 Keen remains as committed to and inspired by his muse as ever. And as for accruing recognition, well, he's done alright on that front, too; from his humble beginnings on the Texas folk scene, he's blazed a peer, critic, and fan-lauded trail that's earned him living-legend (not to mention pioneer) status in the Americana music world. And though the Houston native has never worn his Texas heart on his sleeve, he's long been regarded as one of the Lone Star State's finest (not to mention top-drawing) true singer-songwriters. He was still a relative unknown in 1989 when his second studio album, West Textures, was released \u2014 especially on the triple bill he shared at the time touring with legends Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark \u2014 but once fellow Texas icon Joe Ely recorded both \\\"The Road Goes on Forever\\\" and \\\"Whenever Kindness Fails\\\" on his 1993 album, Love and Danger, the secret was out on Keen's credentials as a songwriter's songwriter. By the end of the decade, Keen was a veritable household name in Texas, headlining a millennial New Year's Eve celebration in Austin that drew an estimated 200,000 people. A dozen years later, he was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame along with the late, great Van Zandt and his old college buddy, Lyle Lovett.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe middle child of a geologist father and an attorney mother, Keen was weaned on classic rock (in particular, the psychedelic blues trio Cream) and his older brother's Willie Nelson records \u2014 but it was his younger sister's downtown Houston celebrity status as a \\\"world-champion foosball player\\\" that exposed him to the area's acoustic folk scene. By the time he started working on his English degree at Texas A&M, he was teaching himself guitar and setting his poetic musings to song. That in turn led to a college fling with a bluegrass ensemble (featuring his childhood friend Bryan Duckworth, who would continue to play fiddle with Keen well into the '90s) and front-porch picking parties with fellow Aggie Lovett at Keen's rental house \u2014 salad days captured in spirit on the Keen/Lovett co-write, \\\"The Front Porch Song,\\\" which both artists would eventually record on their respective debut albums.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Lovett's self-titled debut was released on major-label Curb Records, Keen took the road less travelled, self-financing and producing 1984's No Kinda Dancer and leasing it to the independent label Rounder Records, which issued it on its Philo imprint. \\\"It was difficult, because I didn't know what I was doing ... I literally opened up the phonebook and looked for studios,\\\" Keen recalls. \\\"I basically put it all together through brute force and ignorance, but I was shocked with how well it worked out and very happy with it. We had a release party at Butch Hancock's Dixie Bar and Bustop, and Lyle and Nanci Griffith and a lot of those people who were a part of the Austin folkie scene came out.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nKeen himself had already started to make quite a name for himself on that scene, thanks to four years of constant regional gigging and winning the Kerrville Folk Festival's prestigious New Folk songwriting competition in 1983. After his debut's release, he began touring more and more outside of the state lines, eventually moving to Nashville in 1986. Keen's stint in Music City, U.S.A., lasted just under two years, but he returned to Texas armed with a publishing deal, a new label (another indie, Sugar Hill), and a national booking agent. He closed the decade with 1988's The Live Album and the following year's West Textures, the album that marked the debut of \\\"The Road Goes on Forever\\\" and, not inconsequently, kicked his career into high gear. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith hindsight, Keen admits he no idea at the time of writing it that his song about a couple of ill-fated lovers running afoul of the law would have the legs it did, but he readily points to the forward thinking of DJ Steve Coffman of San Antonio radio station KRIO for helping to start the fire. \\\"He talked the station into doing sort of a free-form programing format, basically anything he liked, which turned out to be some Texas music along with a lot of cool sort of pop music,\\\" he says. \\\"So all of a sudden, I heard my song back-to-back with the Sheryl Crow song that was popular at the time, and that was the first time that I really felt like I was a real part of the music business, despite having been in it already for a pretty long time. And right after that, I went to a show in San Antonio and there were 1,500 people there \u2014 whereas up to that point I'd been playing to, max, maybe 150. That was the real ah-hah moment for me that really got me going and kept me going, because before that I'd been doing this for eight or 10 years and had a lot of rejection but very little success.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that, though, success came in spades. Although he continued to steer clear of the Garth Brooks-dominated waters of the country mainstream, the perfect storm of Keen's literate songcraft, razor wit and killer band (more on that in a bit) stirred up a grassroots sensation in Texas not seen since the '70s heyday of maverick \\\"outlaw country\\\" upstarts Willie, Waylon, and Jerry Jeff Walker. Armed with two more albums (1993's A Bigger Piece of Sky and '94's Gringo Honeymoon) brimming with instant classics like \\\"Corpus Christi Bay,\\\" \\\"Whenever Kindness Fails,\\\" \\\"Gringo Honeymoon,\\\" \\\"Dreadful Selfish Crime\\\" and \\\"Merry Christmas From the Family,\\\" he began packing dancehalls, roadhouses, theaters, and festival grounds with diverse crowds of rowdy college kids, serious singer-songwriter fans and plenty of folks who, like Keen himself, had been around the Texas music scene long enough to remember Willie's earliest 4th of July Picnics. And the phenomenon was not confined to the Texas state lines. Famed producer and pedal steel ace Lloyd Maines (Joe Ely, Terry Allen) helped Keen and his band bottle lighting on 1996's No. 2 Live Dinner, a next-best-thing-to-being-there concert document that remains one of Keen's best-selling albums, and the burgeoning alt-country scene (bolstered by AAA radio stations across the country and magazines like No Depression) embraced Keen as one of its prime movers. In the wake of albums like 1997's Picnic and '98's Walking Distance (both released on major-label Arista), one would have been hard-pressed to tell the difference between a rabid Robert Earl Keen crowd at Texas' legendary Gruene Hall and those at New York City joints like Tramps and the Bowery Ballroom. Little wonder, then, that when the songwriter-revering \\\"Americana\\\" style was officially recognized by the industry 1998, Keen was the genre's first artist to be featured on the cover of the radio trade magazine Gavin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe '90s may have been a boom period for Keen, but his momentum hasn't ebbed a bit since the turn of the century \u2014 nor has his pursuit of continued growth as a writer and artist. If anything, his output from the last decade has been marked by some of the most adventurous music of his career. \\\"Wild Wind,\\\" an unforgettable highlight from Gravitational Forces, his Gurf Morlic-produced 2001 debut for the Nashville-based Americana label Lost Highway, captured the character (and characters) of a small Texas town with a cinematic eye reminiscent of The Last Picture Show; but the album's title track also found Keen wryly experimenting with spacey, beatnik jazz. For the freewheelin', freak-flag-flying Farm Fresh Onions (2003, Audium/Koch), Keen and producer Rich Brotherton (his longtime guitarist) took the band into the proverbial garage to knock out their most rocking set of songs to date \u2014 most notably the psychedelic rave-up of the title track. Brotherton also produced the more rootsy but equally playful What I Really Mean (2005, E1 Music), but Lloyd Maines was back at the helm for 2009's eclectic The Rose Hotel and 2011's spirited Ready for Confetti (both released by Lost Highway). The later was especially well received by fans and critics alike, with AllMusic's Thom Jurek raving, \\\"Ready for Confetti is, without question, Keen's most inspired and focused project in nearly 20 years.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the road goes on and on, with no time for resting on laurels. Not that Keen's complaining. \\\"I had a relatively open schedule for 2013 back at the beginning of the year, but it has just filled in like you wouldn't believe,\\\" he marvels during a rare day off in Kerrville, Texas (where he lives with his wife and two daughters). \\\"I've broke my record this year \u2014 I've packed for five trips at one time, because I wasn't going to be starting any of them in the same place. It's been crazy!\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier this year, Keen played a handful of sold-out theater dates with Lyle Lovett, just two old friends swapping songs on acoustic guitars like they used to do on Keen's front porch in College Station. But the lion's share of his concert schedule still finds him playing full-tilt with his seasoned road and studio band: Brotherton on guitar, Bill Whitbeck on bass, Tom Van Schaik on drums, and Marty Muse on steel guitar. \\\"I've been with this band for 20 years now,\\\" Keen says proudly. \\\"I used to think that was just sort of an interesting fact, but now it's almost a total anomaly \u2014 that just doesn't happen much. I always felt like once you lock into the right bunch of people, you try to do the best by them that you can. So we've been able to stay together a long time, and I think one thing that makes it worthwhile for people to come see us as an act is the fact that it's not like we're trying to work it all out onstage \u2014 we've already worked everything out.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for what they'll be working on next, well, Keen's fans probably won't have to wait very long. Despite the fact that 2014 will mark the 30th anniversary of his first album, No Kinda Dancer, Keen's primary focus remains \u2014 as ever \u2014 more on the road still ahead than the road behind him. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We take everything one year at a time,\\\" he says, \\\"but I am hell-bent and bound to make a record this year. I really don't know what I have in mind as far as what it will be, but what will happen is I will go off to my 'Scriptorium' for three or four days to write with no distractions, and I'll have a record by the time I'm finished. I'm locked into this idea, and I know for a fact that I'm going to get a new record out ... unless I get hit by a bus or get run over by my own bus!\\\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":871},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":272},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":181},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1858},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":91},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":454},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":590},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/38/23/63-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.robertearlkeen.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/robertearlkeen\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/robertearlkeen\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/RobertEarlKeen1\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"RobertEarlKeen1\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.revolutionhallpdx.com/event/1384804?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
