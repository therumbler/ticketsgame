There\u2019s just something about playing with the guys you came up with that is unique, unpredictable and exciting at the same time. It\u2019s always very intuitive with us, almost like we can read each other\u2019s minds and know David\u2019s harmonic facility so well that we instinctively know where the song is going to go.\u201d\\r\\nTo which David Lowery adds, \u201cAll bands have strengths and weaknesses, and for us, often times, they are the same things. We always have so many musical ideas all going at once, and there\u2019s always another melody playing as I\u2019m singing. That\u2019s a challenge, just knowing how to simplify, but I think we do that on La Costa Perdida better than any previous recording. I love the fact that it\u2019s so concise stylistically and thematically consistent throughout.\u201d\\r\\nThey can agree that, whether by design or not, the set of nine vocals and a single instrumental (the trippy, psychedelic jam \u201cAged In Wood\u201d), shapes up as their California rock project. It\u2019s every bit a celebration of Northern California (where the founding members, including Lowery and bassist Victor Krummenacher, first became musically active as students at UC Santa Cruz), anchored by their distinctive, eclectic sound and the visionary lyrics of frontman/founder David Lowery.\\r\\nSometimes those references are direct, as in the dreamy opening harmonies on \u201cNorthern California Girls\u201d or the trippy, electric guitar driven declaration that they\u2019re \u201cToo High For the Love In.\u201d The folksy  title track \u201cLa Costa Perdida\u201d \u2013 is a Norteno -flavored ode to Lost Coast of California, a mostly undeveloped section of the California North Coast in Humboldt and Mendocino Counties. Jonathan Segel, who sweetens this album and all previous Camper projects with violin, guitar, mandolin and organ, says, \u201cIt\u2019s as much a mythological idea of the Lost Coast as a real geographical place, the idea that the society of this region is separate from regular society.\u201d All of this adds to the frolicsome mystique that\u2019s been a band trademark since their debut album Telephone Free Landslide Victory, which featured their first successful single \u201cTake The Skinheads Bowling.\u201d \\r\\nLowery says that it was a serendipitous concert rainout in Big Sur that led them to gather in the living room at the Oakland home of Segel and start writing together. \u201cCamper got an odd offer to play a few shows in an outdoor setting of the Henry Miller Library, in June 2011,\u201d says the Richmond, Virginia based singer, who has also led the more mainstream rock band Cracker (which often tours with CVB) since 1991. \u201cIt never rains in that area, and when we had to postpone the shows a week, instead of scattering, going home and returning, we thought this would be a great time to start writing our next album. Jonathan has a ton of great instruments, we all have laptops and we basically wrote the record in a week. Between that and a later session a few weeks later, we emerged with almost two albums worth of material, some real upbeat, hard rocking and traditional punk rock songs.\u201d\\r\\n\u201cActually,\u201d lead guitarist Greg Lisher adds, \u201cthe previous October, I had flown to Richmond to work with David, and over the course of eight days we exchanged a lot of great ideas and wrote some songs for future potential development. One of the songs that evolved to make the cut on La Costa Perdida was \u2018Summer Days,\u2019 which started with my chord progressions before he and I worked on the melody. We wrote a lot more songs at Jonathan\u2019s place, and the coolest part of the experience was that it was the most organic Camper record ever. Back 20 years ago, David would essentially bring in material and we would write all our parts to what he had done. This time, most of the songs began with someone playing a chord progression and the others riffing off that until the melodies and harmonies took shape.\u201d\\r\\nSegel can\u2019t pinpoint the exact time sequence of the postponement and writing sessions, but recalls that he and Krummenacher were already vibing on some new music outside the CVB experience ( in the two decades after CBV\u2019s first break up in 1990, the two ran their own label Magnetic). \u201cIt was great that no one had to be anywhere else in the country that week, and we not only wrote many songs, but also recorded in my living room, doing many takes of the songs using acoustic guitar, violin, bass and electric guitar. While the Northern Cal idea was David\u2019s, the vibe of many of the songs reminded me of the classic (1973) Beach Boys album Holland. As always, we came to these sessions from our own separate musical worlds, bringing different elements naturally, without any conscious thought.\u201d\\r\\nAt last, it\u2019s Krummenacher\u2019s turn to chime in: \u201cThe coolest part of La Costa Perdida was the fact that everything flowed from the fact that these distinctive musicians and personalities sat in the living room. You wait for that first spark, and that moment when something starts and starts coming to life is the most honest, enjoyable element. With us, we just settle right back into that place where we\u2019re getting along and communicating and the music flows. We literally worked on six ideas each per day. This was a very fertile time. Musically, I believe La Costa Perdida is our most mature, grown up recording to date. Traditionally, Camper has always maintained a nervous edge partially because we grew up in punk rock, like we were a punk band at heart that kept reinventing itself. Now we\u2019ve got this organic feeling and our music sounds like four people are writing it. The songs have great energy, but we\u2019re more relaxed and stately, and a lot more confident. The songwriting here has elements of vintage Camper along with grown up Camper.\u201d\\r\\nThough much of the tracking was done via Segel\u2019s home studio setup (known as The Magnetic Satellite), further sessions were done at Electric Studio in Berkeley and Sharkbite Studios in Oakland. The bulk of the mixing was done by Drew Vandenberg and the band at Chase Park Transduction in Athens, Georgia, Lowery\u2019s second home base. Though Frank Funaro is CVB\u2019s live drummer for the handful of U.S. touring spurts that the band does between outside projects every year, the skins on La Costa Perdida were played by Michael Urbano, an associate of Segel\u2019s who lives in Oakland. \\r\\nCamper Van Beethoven paints its musical map of Northern California portrait with a lot of different hues and textures, starting with the Americana flavored opening singalong \u201cCome Down The Coast.\u201d After the anthemic, trip of \u201cToo High For The Love In,\u201d they submerge into a dark brooding realm before emerging into a hypnotic optimistic light on the garage rocker \u201cYou Got To Roll.\u201d \u201cSomeday Our Love Will Sell Us Out\u201d offers a sweet hodgepodge of almost everything CVB is about: ethereal vocals, booming drums, scorching distorted guitars, a soaring exotic violin, trippy ambience and psychedelic spontaneity. \\r\\n\u201cPeaches in the Summertime\u201d has a Middle Eastern/Turkish melody (Lowery\u2019s take, anyway) and borrows its late refrain from the 18th Century folk song \u201cShady Grove.\u201d \u201cNorthern California Girls\u201d showcases the colorful vocal-guitar dialogue between Lowery and Lisher. \u201cSummer Days\u201d is perhaps the most poetic tune on La Costa Perdida--the lyrics empowered by an instrumental jam featuring guitar, violin, booming drums and symphonic magic. It touches on the idea of giving up one's humanity to live and work in a bustling city. The dusty, galloping, Spanish folk-inflected title track is followed by the wild, distorted and spacey sonic experiment \u201cAged In Wood\u201d (an instrumental that doesn\u2019t say anything in particular, yet still makes a statement). The set wraps with the sweeping, symphonic \u201cLove For All Time,\u201d a tune that each member of CVB calls a favorite for obvious reasons. Opening with lush sea sounds, the piece is one Lowery calls \u201cthe most complex on the record, a love song infused with the mythology of the stars and Greek and Roman gods with a Tom Waits-type vocal that fits perfectly.\u201d Segel and his wife Sanna do the backing vocals on this majestic closer. \\r\\nCamper Van Beethoven\u2019s history begins in the mid-80s in Santa Cruz, California (up the coast a ways from Big Sur), when David Lowery and Victor Krummenacher formed the band, and\u2014after Jonathan Segel joined the group--their jangly and stoned \u201cTake The Skinheads Bowling\u201d became an instant college radio staple. Their 80s discography includes Telephone Free Landslide Victory (1985), II & III (1986, the first featuring Greg Lisher), Camper Van Beethoven (1986), Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart (1988) and Key Lime Pie (1989). The band was one of the founders of the indie rock genre and one of the most eclectic bands of all time, known for a variety of folk, rock, punk, and world influences put into a playful blender. Krummenacher and Lisher formed Monks of Doom in the early 90\u2019s and Krummenacher later began a solo career, recording several albums with guests like Dave Alvin. Segel played with Dieselhead, Sparklehorse and fronted his own bands Hieronymus, Firebrain and Jack & Jill, later playing under his own name. Lowery released the solo album The Palace Guards on 429 Records in 2011.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/36/71/55-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/36/71/55-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/36/71/55-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/36/71/55-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/36/71/55-og.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/36/71/55-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/36/71/55-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/36/71/55-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/36/71/55-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/36/71/55-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":400,\"height\":267},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/00/36/71/55-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.campervanbeethoven.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/camperbeethoven\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"camperbeethoven\"},{\"id\":550391,\"name\":\"The Darnell Boys\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"},{\"id\":1768670,\"name\":\"Daisy\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"\",\"urlTwitter\":\"\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1363353?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
