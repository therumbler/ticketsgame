Much in the same way Berlioz made strides to bring a new element to classical music, Bearlios wants to give their fans an experience through music that will stay with them.\\n\\nWith sounds reminiscent of bands like Seahaven and Have Mercy with a touch of Blink-182 and Metallica thrown in for good measure, Bearlios have forged their own sound that is unique and ear pleasing. Their songs are awash with depth and meaning while getting in your face and make you lose control.\\n\\nThe 4 members of Bearlios have been playing music together since they were in high school. They have a musical brotherhood and passion for the unique sounds of music that you will feel emanating from the stage. Their lyrics will leave you thinking and their sound will leave you discovering something new with every listen.\",\"artists\":[{\"name\":\"Bearlios\",\"mbid\":null,\"image_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/large/6343200.jpeg\",\"thumb_url\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bit-photos/thumb/6343200.jpeg\",\"facebook_tour_dates_url\":\"http://www.bandsintown.com/Bearlios/facebookapp?came_from=67\",\"facebook_page_url\":\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bearlios/676562475732775\",\"tracker_count\":92,\"url\":\"Bearlios\",\"website\":null}],\"venue\":{\"name\":\"White Oak Music Hall\",\"place\":\"White Oak Music Hall\",\"city\":\"Houston\",\"region\":\"TX\",\"country\":\"United States\",\"latitude\":29.7858124,\"longitude\":-95.3669739}}]\n",
