(Live)\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Issuing forth from the same rich vein of electronic bands that contains the likes of Groove Armada, Basement Jaxx, Soul II Soul, Leftfield and Massive Attack, South African duo Goldfish Live are creating expansive, enveloping, sumptuously funk-filled music for new and older generations alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom their beginnings as music students surfing and chilling on the beaches of coastal Cape Town, Dominic Peters and David Poole have gone on to become one of the most original production teams in recent history, creating award-winning albums and developing a live DJ show that blends recorded sound with live percussion, string, woodwind and brass, blowing through all genres and surpassing all expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\n2005\u2019s freshman album \u201cCaught In The Loop\u201d first won them global attention with its chilled out, trip-hop electronica vibe. Locking themselves away with a double bass, saxophone and a couple of synths, the pair emerged with a ground breaking long player that spawned tracks like the delicately languorous \u201cThe Real Deal\u201d, swing-infected, bass-injected \u201cAll Night\u201d, jazz-influenced \u201cMbira Beat\u201d and the stunning \u201cEgyptology\u201d. It was a collective sound that was picked by Radio 1\u2019s Pete Tong as his Album Of The Summer, marking the band as ones to watch. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter scooping a record-breaking eight nominations at the 2009 South African Music Awards (SAMA) in the wake of sophomore album \u201cPerceptions of Pacha\u201d \u2013 named after residence at the legendary Ibiz venue \u2013 and winning Best Producer and Best Dance Album categories, Goldfish returned with their third studio album. 2010\u2019s \u201cGet Busy Living\u201d cemented them as one of South Africa\u2019s biggest musical exports worldwide. Touring, producing, remixing with the likes of Fedde Le Grand, supported by everyone from Dr Dre and Faithless to Sebastian Ingrosso, Sander Kleinenberg and Pete Tong \u2013 Goldfish were the darlings of funk-pop with an army of fans in all corners of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n2013 saw the release of \u201c1 Million Views\u201d with John Mani on lead vocals. The track, subsequently remixed by Bakermat, was a tongue-in-cheek take on music artists\u2019 obsession with social media, leading into their latest album \u201cThree Second Memory\u201d. The album is as close as you can get to musical perfection \u2013 \u201cFollowers Of The Beat\u201d, \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d, \u201cMoonwalk Away\u201d and titular track \u201cThree Second Memory\u201d winning Goldfish \u201cBest Pop Act\u201d at the 2014 MTV Africa Music Awards. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn between the music, Goldfish continually tour the planet. From the Sydney Opera House to the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium, from Miami to Sao Paulo to London and beyond, from Glastonbury and Sensation White to Ultra Music Festival Miami and South Africa, 46664, Wakarusa, Mysteryland (US), Electric Forest, Northern Nights, KAABOO, Get Loaded In The Park and sell-out North American tours, Goldfish have continually proven themselves to be one of the most exciting and inspiring live acts around, with an unqualified ability to get the crowd off their feet. With more dates across the Americas and Europe being added to their rapidly expanding tour diary, Goldfish once more look set to prove why they are one of the most exciting, talented, funk-drenched live House bands on the face of the planet.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/03-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://goldfishlive.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/GOLDFISHLIVE\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/Goldfishlive\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"Goldfishlive\"},{\"id\":1704313,\"name\":\"jackLNDN\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"JackLNDN is one part classical technician and two parts main room club surgeon.  He's simultaneously a mixture of centuries of European musical heritage and a sneak preview of the future.  As a producer and DJ, he has quickly established himself as a character whose work is quickly drawing attention for its freshness and whose potential is seemingly endless.  In his twenty years on earth, LNDN has spent more time performing and playing music than most do in a lifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in the early 90s, Londoner Jack Aisher spent the majority of youth attending Windsor Castle for the Queen.  He rigorously trained in classical music, developing a slew of skills: choral singing, conducting, writing, and performing cello, piano and guitar.  The immersive education required performing at \\\"8 events a week, 14 hours of rehearsals a week and 30 minutes of training every day before breakfast.  It was like boot camp,\\\" he admits, \\\"but so rewarding.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, he met dance music.  On a holiday to Ibiza with a friend, LNDN, a teen, experienced proper clubbing for the first time. He reveals, \\\"We didn't really know what to expect.  I went to a club \u2013 saw Fatboy Slim at Space.  He was standing in for Carl Cox.  Every night I went to every single club. Then I started looking hard at the scene,\\\" and began DJing from there.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his first DJ gig: \\\"I blagged my way into the job \u2013 it was a week before NY in Switzerland \u2013 I was just talking shit.  I learned the basics of DJing in a week.  Another guy from a bigger club liked what he heard and asked me to be their resident.  It was a ski resort.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ski season finished, he returned to London and was intent on experimenting in the studio and as a DJ.  He entered the British Student DJ Championships and got invited to the finals in Ibiza. Soon after, he began spinning student nights at Fabric and hosting his own weekly nights. He has a photographic memory when it comes to records.  He \\\"knows every record inside and out\\\" and would \\\"never play a record he doesn't know, like some track he just downloaded that day and hasn't even listened to yet.\\\"  He may be young, but he has the elder sense of purism usually reserved for jocks twice his age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Doing shows in my hometown was a huge deal for me\\\" he confesses. \\\"I was in the booth with some of my heroes watching and learning new tricks all the time\\\". LNDN has already shared stages with; Annie Mac, Zane Lowe, Sub Focus, Kissy Sellout, Ms Dynamite, Doorly, Chase & Status, Pendulum, Mistajam, Skream, Nero, Example, Jaguar Skills, Crookers, Sinden, Zomboy, Joy Orbison and a fair few more.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the production side, he started gleaning tips from friend Harry Wolfman and combined that with his knowledge of Logic and other bits of his training.  Ever since, he has been slaving away in the studio, developing a variety of his unique strains of dance music.  The linchpin of the sound has always been house, but filtered through an ever-evolving set of lenses: progressive, pop, jazz, and beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung JackLNDN is now poised to move large congregations himself.  His remix and original production slate is stacked for 2012, in addition to his weekly DJ slots.  This classical-turned-dance prodigy has got the musical chops and attention to detail so often lacking in EDM.  To call JackLNDN a bright, young voice might just be the understatement of the year.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atjmbo.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":618},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atjmbo1.png\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atlg.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":193},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atlg1.png\",\"width\":300,\"height\":193},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atmd.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":129},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atmd1.png\",\"width\":200,\"height\":129},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-og.png\",\"width\":1500,\"height\":965},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atsm.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":64},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atsm1.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":64},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-sq.png\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-sqsm.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atxl.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":322},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atxl1.png\",\"width\":500,\"height\":322},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atxxl.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":418},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/28/62/09-atxxl1.png\",\"width\":650,\"height\":418}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://soundcloud.com/jacklndn\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/jackLNDN\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/jackLNDN\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"jackLNDN\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.boweryballroom.com/event/1312241?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
