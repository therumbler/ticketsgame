From blood-born howls to\\r\\nidiosyncratic phrasing, she is the big red dot saying You Are Here. The Nashville-based artist travels the\\r\\nlands of rock, afro punk, and country, squarely situated in the continent of the Blues.\\r\\nAsk about her artistic goals, and the songwriter/vocalist will say, \\\"I want to shine a light on the unseen, and\\r\\nspeak the unspeakable.\\\" Adia Victoria is a truth teller. She admits, \\\"I don't necessarily paint myself in a\\r\\nflattering light. This isn't the pop version of pretty or the strategically posed pretty-ugly. Sometimes I'm\\r\\njust ugly. There's a brat in some of these songs, selfish, na\u00efve, vengeful, but there's also a tender eye that\\r\\njust wants the listener to feel seen and understood.\\\"\\r\\nRolling Stone Magazine featured Adia Victoria as one of \\\"10 New Artists You Need to Know.\\\" The Village\\r\\nVoice called her an \\\"eerie, intriguing songwriter,\\\" with \\\"bone chilling guitar riffs and lyrics topped with\\r\\ncandid scorn. Vogue highlighted the recording artist as one of \\\"5 Beauties Who Answer to Afropunk's\\r\\nRebellious Call.\\\"\\r\\nAny forces that tried to tell the former ballet dancer/telemarketer/French major to play small, failed.\\r\\nGrowing up in Spartanburg, South Carolina and raised in a strict, Seventh Day Adventist atmosphere, she\\r\\nknows about feeling less than whole. But following her inner voice, and creating a new life for herself in\\r\\nNew York, Atlanta, and now Nashville (with stints in Paris and Germany) honed a self-assured voice that\\r\\nresists the outside gaze. She explains, \\\"I wrote this album as a memorial to my 20s. Those are tender years\\r\\nfor a lot of women. It hurts. You get busted up in love and life. You make a lot of mistakes. You meet a lot\\r\\nof people who do you dirty because you don't understand your value yet.\\\"\\r\\nAdia Victoria spent the last few years writing, recording, touring and performing, while entrenched in the\\r\\ninfamous artist R&R world \u2013 restaurants and retail work. Day jobs at a laundry list of Nashville \\\"it\\\" and not\\r\\nso \\\"it\\\" spots gave the musician lots of people watching time as well as the mental and emotional space to\\r\\nmarinate in her art.\\r\\nAdia blows the social hush-hush lid off the mental and emotional state of a young black woman growing up\\r\\nunder the poverty line in the Deep South and all the implications of such. No pretense. No jive. But also,\\r\\nlike the writing of Eudora Welty and Tennessee Williams, there is plenty of Southern Gothic styled, marrow\\r\\ndeep joy.\\r\\nIn a recent feature story, Fader encouraged us to, \\\"Meet Adia Victoria, A Poet Making Country Music a\\r\\nLittle Creepier.\\\" She is found in album cuts like Sea of Sand and Stuck in the South, revealing some of her\\r\\nplace-based aha moments. In the latter, she notes, \\\"I don't know nothin' about Southern belles/ But I can\\r\\ntell you something about Southern hell.\\\" As songs like \\\"Head Rot\\\", and first single \\\"Dead Eyes\\\" show us,\\r\\nAdia says, \\\"it's an album of falling in love, dealing with loss, confusion, anger, love, and loving myself.\\\"\\r\\nProduced by Roger Moutenot (Yo La Tengo, Sleater Kinney) and the artist herself, recorded at Nashville,\\r\\nTennessee's Haptown Studios, Beyond the Bloodhounds features the indelible lyrics, voice, and guitar solos\\r\\nof Adia Victoria along with a band of talented musicians including Tiffany Minton (Drums), Alex Caress\\r\\n(keys), Mason Hickman (guitar), and Jason Harris (bass). She recalls, \\\"the studio is a Music City treasure. It\\r\\nused to be a car repair shop. You walk in and there are no windows. It's dark and moody. It feels like\\r\\nwalking into the mind.\\\"\\r\\nThe result of a lifetime of introspection and a younger self marked by silent observation, Adia Victoria's\\r\\nBeyond the Bloodhounds was three active, recording years in the making. The title pays homage to a line in\\r\\nHarriet Jacobs' Narrative in the Life of a Slave Girl.\\r\\nUltimately, Victoria's debut album is more both/and, than either/or. The complexity of her Southern,\\r\\nbarrel-aged roots and world traveling, bookworm woman ways will lure you out of the status quo.\\r\\nPublications like American Songwriter, Rookie, and NPR are taking notice.\\r\\nNow on the brink of her 30s, fluent in the language of her own self, Adia Victoria stands poised to take her\\r\\nplace in a line of true artists. Her mother warned that she feels too much and would be torn up by the\\r\\nworld. Adia will tell you that proved to be true. \\\"I've felt shredded, but I'm now blessed to embrace the\\r\\nintense feelings as part of my job. That's what I do. It's my bread and butter. My art depends on me feeling\\r\\nand experiencing. I show up, live, and come back and say, oooooh Honey, it was like this...\\\"\\r\\n2016 will be a big year with the release of a full length album and her Me & the Devil tour through the U.S.\\r\\nand Europe. Listeners will hear a self-described back-porch-blues-swamp-cat-lady-howlin'-at-the-moon.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":641},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1367},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":434},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/78/28-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://adiavictoria.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/adiavictoria\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/AdiaVictoria\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"AdiaVictoria\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1383940?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
