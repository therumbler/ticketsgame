Ron is currently a member of The Warren Haynes Band and leads his own band.\\r\\n\\r\\nDurga Mcbroom (Pink Floyd), \\r\\nDurga McBroom (b. Los Angeles, CA) was a voracious reader from the age of 2 1/2, which marks the beginning of her love affair with the written word, not to mention that when other little girls her age were listening to The Osmonds, she was submerging herself in the music and lyrics of Joni Mitchell. Having a flamboyant nature, Durga attended U.C.L.A. (Theatre Arts Major), only leaving to play a featured role in the classic hit film \\\"Flashdance\\\". Other roles followed, and when she got tired of playing hookers and prison inmates, Durga tackled the music business. Her first tour was with the legendary band Pink Floyd. It was the first of 3 world tours with them (she is the only backing singer to be on all 3 tours), as well as one solo tour with David Gilmour. Because of her work with the band, Durga moved to London, where she formed her own band Blue Pearl. Her first single, \\\"Naked in the Rain\\\" reached 4 on the British Pop chart, and in the top 20 in almost every other European chart. Blue Pearl went on to have 3 more chart-topping singles (including \\\"Can You Feel The Passion\\\" which reached 1 in the Billboard Dance Charts in the US), and Durga began writing poetry as well as her lyrics. She has written an entire book of poems called \\\"Gods and Lovers\\\". In 2009, \\\"Naked In The Rain\\\" enjoyed it's 20th anniversary re-release (it hit 1 in the UK Club Breaker's chart), and a brand-new version is currently available on iTunes. Durga took Buenos Aires by storm in 2009 by doing three shows with The End, the premier Pink Floyd tribute band in South America! She returned in April of 2010 with pals Guy Pratt and Jon Carin of Pink Floyd fame.Durga released her first single under her own name \\\"Hurricane Heart\\\" on iTunes in early 2011, another single Blue Pearl single \\\"Take My Breath Away\\\" with The Wideboys in 2012, and her newest single, a remake of the hit \\\"Can You Feel The Passion\\\" with backing vocals by the legendary Boy George came out on Feb 11th 2013. In 2014, she started recording an ALL NEW Blue Pearl album with Youth. More work with the legendary David Gilmour is on the horizon . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nJans Ingber (The Motet)\\r\\nJans started his journey in a log cabin in the woods of Nelson, BC, Canada. He was born to hippie parents who met on a communal traveling school bus and moved to the woods of Canada as part of the \\\"Back to the Land\\\" movement. \\r\\nAt 2 years-old he and his family moved to Eugene, Oregon, a place where counter culture walks side by side with rural living. In his teenage years, when conventional schooling had failed keep his attention, he discovered music as an outlet. In this place, Jans began his search for spirituality and connection through the realm of music.\\r\\n\\r\\nJans grew up listening to his parents record collections: Stevie Wonder, James Taylor, King Sunny Ade, Billy Preston, Miriam Makeba, Sly Stone, The Persuations and Al Green......... Music was constantly wafting though the air, and the influences were wide and varied. Soon after high school Jans discovered a culture of music that truly moved him - african folkloric drum and dance. For the next six years he studied the rhythms, dance and song of West Africa. His drive to learn more led him to the countryside of Senegal, Mali, Guinee and Burkina Faso, where he travelled for six months studying with some of the most accomplished drummers and dancers of the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis journey to Africa was just the beginning. For the next three years Jans immersed himself in the world of afro-cuban folkloric music, spending his winters in Cuba. HIs most recent travels took him to Brazil, where he soaked in the country's vast musical landscape. About his travels Jans explains, \\\"...I was trying to integrate the feeling of some of the great nature based religions of the world by exploring some of the places where religion, music and ceremony intersect.\\\" He continues, \\\"I didn\u2019t come from any specific religion. My parents raised me with a general love of life. So I figured it was my job to go out into the world and find what moved me. I found music. The folkloric music seemed familiar when I sang it. It felt like it was part of me.....There is an undeniable spirit when drumming, song and dance are all part of one whole. I strive to inject this feeling into the music that comes naturally to me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jans came back from his travels he joined the Colorado-based nationally touring act \\\"The Motet\\\". The Motet combined funk and jazz with the traditional drumming of Cuba, Brazil and Africa. Jans toured as lead singer, songwriter and percussionist for the band. During those travels he met, and eventually toured with, jazz great Charlie Hunter. It was through Charlie that Jans met the songstress Norah Jones, singing duets with her in multiple shows.After almost four years of two-hundred shows a year all over the country, Jans left the Motet to record his first release under his own name. \\\"I had such a wonderful experience traveling and making community through music.......It was time for me to step back, take a deep breath and make an album that was intimate and warm.\\\" For the next three years Jans engrossed himself in the writing, recording and releasing of \\\"The Offering.\\\" Collaborating with Steve Vidaic, keyboardist for international touring act \\\"Citizen Cope\\\", he produced \\\"The Offering\\\" with the intention of creating a piece of work that speaks equally to the heart and the mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie Hunter says about him, \u201cJans Ingber is a musical force to be reckoned with. His affinity for deep soul music, whether it be Donny Hathaway or Los Munequitos de Matanzas, is evident in everything he does. His long years of study and practice, in what some may think of as disparate aesthetics, have created a unique and soulful musical voice.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Strength and sensitivity, combined, is a powerful brew. Jans Ingber is an artist truly adept at creating this elixir. Sensitive enough to know when not to push, strong enough to expose the true nature of his heart, Jans creates music with physical, mental and spiritual elements teasing each other into perfect balance.\\\"\\r\\n- Christina Eisert - Boulder Weekly\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I could compare the voice of Jans Ingber to any great Motown singer. With self-assuredness,\\r\\nHis voice storms through..with social commentary.... moving with a heavy dose of soul.\\\"\\r\\n- Technicianonline.com\\r\\n\\r\\nJans has had the pleasure to perform with hundreds of musicians all over the states:\\r\\nNorah Jones, Joshua Redman, George Porter, Charlie Hunter, Stanton Moore, Robert Walter, Karl Denson, John Fishman, Kai Eckhart, Adam Deitch, Ivan Neville, Grace Potter, Jeff Coffin, Jason Marsalis, Nicolas Payton, The Slip, Los Van Van, The String Cheese Incident and many others......\\r\\n\\r\\nMORE SPECIAL GUEST TBA!!!\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":851,\"height\":315},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":851,\"height\":315},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":111},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":111},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":74},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":74},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-og.jpg\",\"width\":851,\"height\":315},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":37},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":37},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":185},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":185},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":241},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/37/40/15-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":241}},\"youtubeVideos\":[{\"videoId\":\"RlIWqrQg8cQ\",\"title\":\"The Everyone Orchestra - 10.20.2013 - Mulberry Mountain Harvest Festival\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RlIWqrQg8cQ\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"},{\"videoId\":\"09zfW5eNGyc\",\"title\":\"Everyone Orchestra \\\"Conducting\\\"\",\"embedCodeIframe\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/09zfW5eNGyc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\"}],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"<iframe title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" class=\\\"youtube-player\\\" type=\\\"text/html\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"344\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RlIWqrQg8cQ\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowFullScreen><\\/iframe>\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.everyoneorchestra.com/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/theeveryoneorchestra\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/EveryoneOrchestra\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/every1orchestra\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"every1orchestra\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1768706,\"name\":\"FT.

They live in the space that rests between the tension of the familiar and the truly distinct. At its core, the family unit portion of the band, brothers Johnny and Andrew and papa John Trongone, who give the band its name, lay the foundation, the natural cohesion that comes with an intimate familial bond.
