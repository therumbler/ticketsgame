Lister\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Roaring drunk in Hamburg. Locked in a bunker in Berlin. Tearing up the road in New York and Tokyo. Dreaming of Cairo. The wide-eyed, rump-shaking world of folk punk heroes Skinny Lister is broadening by the record. If their folk debut celebrated the sticks and their punkier second blinked in the bright lights of London, their rocked-up third, The Devil, The Heart & The Fight, sees them go global.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cThe first album [Forge & Flagon] was quite rural,\u201d says singer, guitarist and one-time chief of the stomp-box Dan Heptinstall, whilst the second [Down On Deptford Broadway] was very London-centric. With this latest album, because we\u2019ve done so much traveling, it was broadening out a bit, it\u2019s more on-the-road. We cobbled the songs together all across the world. Every day we\u2019d be going into different dive rehearsal studios all over America, Germany and the UK. Anti-Flag let us use their space in Pittsburgh. In Berlin we used a bunker, an old air raid shelter from the war and they\u2019d converted into a rehearsal rooms.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe got locked in!\u201d adds singer and dancer Lorna Thomas. \u201cThe owners were like \u2018see you at six\u2019 and then the guys wanted a ciggy and went upstairs to have a smoke and started panicking\u2026 \u2018We can\u2019t get out of here\u2019.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs folk rock\u2019s rowdiest rabble since 2009, Skinny\u2019s world has always been an adventure-filled place to be. They\u2019ve held gigs in Land Rovers. They\u2019ve sung while wing-walking. They\u2019ve toured in a narrow boat. They\u2019ve stomped and jigged on restaurant tables, in hotel elevators and in record label car parks. And, as their two previous albums sent them reeling into the hearts of America, the UK, Germany and Japan \u2013 on headline tours and stints with Frank Turner, Flogging Molly, Dropkick Murphys and the Vans Warped Tour - wherever they play their lusty shanties, punk folk roar-alongs and crazed whirls of love, fighting and booze, you\u2019ll still find them out dancing with the crowd, passing around their flagon of rum or crowd-surfing to the bar, double-bass in hand, to neck shots mid-song. Make no bones \u2013 Skinny Lister are the wildest party band you\u2019ll ever get drunk with. And you will get drunk with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cWe still have the flagon,\u201d says Dan. \u201cWe pass it full of of rum out to the crowd and everyone partakes.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nPieced together while on the road, and recorded over five weeks in Newcastle Under Lyme\u2019s Silk Mill Studio in May 2016 with producer Tristan Ivemy (Frank Turner, The Holloways), The Devil, The Heart & The Fight is Skinny Lister\u2019s most far-reaching, exciting and accomplished album yet. It\u2019s a full-on rock record that splashes even more punk vigour and eighties pop elements across their fervent folk canvas, taking in hints of Adam Ant and Kate Bush. It also brings the folk storytelling tradition bang up to date with its tales of on-the-road mayhem, most notably the Pogue-ish Hamburg Drunk, the story of the fateful night they ended a tour in Hamburg with plenty of rider booze left and decided the most sensible course of action was to neck the lot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI stamped on a homeless guy\u2019s cup of money and dragged it along the street,\u201d Dan confesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt was horrible, really dark,\u201d Lorna laughs. \u201cHe was clinging to this bottle of whiskey going \u2018it\u2019s mine! It\u2019s mine!\u2019 and knocking everybody out of the way. Prostitutes were attacking him on the Reeperbahn. Then we found this amazing bar where they actually let us in, and Dan pulled his toothbrush out of his jacket \u2013 he has a habit of cleaning his teeth before he goes onstage, weirdly \u2013 and started frothing up his beer, that was going everywhere, he was cleaning his teeth with beer and it wasn\u2019t until he started to do somersaults that the barmaid came up and said \u2018we don\u2019t want your kind here, get out now!\u2019 Ever since then we keep going back and she remembers him and she welcomes us with open arms. \u2018Hamburg drunk\u2019 has turned into a catchphrase within Skinny Lister. Even my mum would be like \u2018you didn\u2019t get Hamburg drunk last night did you Lorna?\u2019\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the fiery Elvis-gone-folk roar of opener Wanted \u2013 Dan saluting London, New York and Cairo in a song \u201cabout looking for life in the cities we\u2019d visit\u201d - The Devil, The Heart & The Fight comes out fists first. \u201cWe wanted a big sound,\u201d says Lorna, \u201cwe wanted it to sound punchy and have more attitude than the last one.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey wanted it to be brutally honest and close to the knuckle too. \u201cThis album has been inspired by Trouble On Oxford Street a bit more,\u201d Lorna reveals, \u201cthere\u2019s a few more true stories on it. Nobody\u2019s safe. If you know us, you\u2019re not safe.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve gone pretty close to home on a lot of the songs,\u201d Dan adds. \u201cOne of them\u2019s about our drummer Thom who had his wedding cancelled by his fianc\u00e9e. Everything I write is true but there\u2019s a lot of songs on there about people that are pretty close to me.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the jubilant Geordie Lad is an open letter of reconciliation to their ex-bassist Dan Gray. \u201cHe left the band and there was a bit of falling out,\u201d Dan explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that we\u2019re not as good friends as we were. So it\u2019s a little nod to that as well as speaking to him indirectly through the medium of album.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what of Charlie, eponymous star of a pounding pop classic who \u201ccarries the dream for all of us, flying the flag for northerners, council estate to Hollywood\u2026 like Steve McQueen he took the jump\u201d? \u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine from Bridlington,\u201d says Dan. \u201cHe lived on a council estate I used to live on in East Yorkshire. He\u2019s only twenty-one but his sister was doing bits of acting work, took him along to an audition and he got picked up by an agent who then passed him on to an agent in LA and from there he\u2019s picked up a role in a film that\u2019s coming out this year and a big Netflix series that\u2019s about to hit the screens. So he\u2019s by accident fallen into this life. There\u2019s a bit of jealousy in there but good on him.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nA mature, vibrant and varied record, it mingles classic Skinny folk romances (Grace, Reunion) with epic rock takes on rafter-rattling shanties (Beat It From The Chest) and hearty Dexys-style tributes to the fans they meet on the road (Fair Winds & Following Seas), plus a hitherto unseen darker side. Take the deceptively upbeat Injuries, Dan\u2019s ode on the bruising nature of life, or Devil In Me, in which Lorna comes on like a particularly melodic Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction: \u201cthe devil in me will come for you and you\u2019ll pay the price for not being very nice\u2026 you took my life, I\u2019m taking yours, that seems to me a fair trade\u201d. Gulp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cIt is a bit murder-y,\u201d Lorna says, \u201cevery girlfriend who\u2019s got an ounce of jealousy or insecurity or feeling that she likes the guy more than the guy likes her has got that \u2018don\u2019t fucking fuck this up or I\u2019ll cut your balls off\u2019.\u201d \u201cIt was something to do with The Catcher In The Rye and Mark Chapman, who shot Lennon,\u201d adds Dan. \u201cThose stalker type characters. I was trying to capture that dark stalking mentality. It\u2019s nice to twist it \u2013 a love song but a bit darker, more threatening. It\u2019s almost like Bonny Away\u2019s darker cousin.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd The Devil, The Heart & The Fight is like Skinny\u2019s previous albums gone backpacking; expanding its horizons, full of adventure, discovering itself and doing things it regrets in the morning. Have heart, ye devils, join the fight.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":1084},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":339},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":226},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-og.jpg\",\"width\":1814,\"height\":2048},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":113},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":565},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":334},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":734},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/31/21/43-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.skinnylister.com/skinnyblog/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"http://www.myspace.com/skinnylister\",\"urlFacebook\":\"http://www.facebook.com/skinnylister\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/skinnylister\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"skinnylister\"}],\"supports\":[{\"id\":1773381,\"name\":\"Lincoln Durham\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Armed with old bastardized mid-century guitars, hand-me-down fiddles and banjos, home-made contraptions with just enough tension on a string to be considered an instrument and any random percussive item he can get his hands or feet on, Lincoln Durham is a Obnoxious Southern-Gothic-Gospel-Revival-Punk One-Man-Band with a heavy amped edge, preaching the gospel of some new kind of depraved music. With driving guttural beats backboning various growling stringed instruments Lincoln gives birth to a sound that transcends genres with his dark, poetic and raw writing style telling tales that E.A. Poe would have been proud of.\\n\\nLincoln's musical odyssey began when his grandpa, Charlie, and dad, Ed, put a fiddle in his hands at age 4. He would grow into an accomplished fiddle player winning the Youth Fiddle Championship at age 10. Lincoln afterward followed the path so many musicians have, finding his vice in the seductive, siren-like callings of the electric guitar. Or, in Lincoln's case, the acoustic slide guitar with gnarly pickups haphazardly screwed into it.\\n\\nLincoln's true biography is in his live show. The passion in his sweat drenched, electrifyingly mesmerizing one-man-band show draws you in to feel every scar and drop of blood in his painfully intimate lyrics. It takes something beautifully \\\"off\\\" to get on stage with just hands and feet for a band, driven by a howling voice, and morbidly preach a music that harkens back to the old blues masters, Son House and Fred McDowell, infused with the edge and angst of Punk and darkened from the bad influences of Tom Waits and Nick Cave.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://lincolndurham.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/lincolndurhammusic\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/LincolnDurham\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"LincolnDurham\"},{\"id\":1773384,\"name\":\"Trapper Schoepp\",\"startTime\":null,\"eventDescription\":\"Trapper Schoepp is a young man who's befriended a strange and diverse cast of characters during his 24 years. That small army of rogues and rebels, drifters and dreamers, soldiers and schemers populate his songs, their tragedies and comedies, their lives and deaths recalled in his finely etched musical vignettes.  \\n\\nThe Minnesota-born, Wisconsin-based tunesmith and teller of tales (both tall and true), returns with his second effort Rangers & Valentines (Xtra Mile Recordings). The record follows his critically acclaimed 2012 debut Run Engine, Run, with his band the Shades. That LP earned notices in Rolling Stone, American Songwriter and Paste, with the folks at Huffington Post calling him a \\\"master storyteller\\\" and PBS hailing his \\\"story songs that explore and explode the conventions of rock and roll.\\\"\\n\\nOn Rangers & Valentines, Schoepp defies the limitations of the standard-issue Americana platter, hopping genres \u2013 you'll hear lots of brass, backing singers and B-3 \u2014 as the songs build to delirious musical highs. His narratives, meanwhile, find subjects in the narrow margins of society, the strange twists (literal and metaphorical) in the weather, and the vagaries of a troubadour's transient life \u2013 with lyrics that flash a lacerating wit and humanist streak that's at the core of his craft.  \\n\\nProduced by pop polymath and Raconteurs member Brendan Benson at his Readymade Studios in Nashville, the record finds Schoepp handling vocals, guitar and harmonica. He's aided by an array of estimable musicians including his brother and musical-foil-since-birth Tanner Schoepp (providing bass guitar and vocal harmonies), Steve Selvidge (The Hold Steady), John Davis (Superdrag), the McCrary Sisters \u2014 even comedian and WTF podcaster Marc Maron chips in on background vocals and lead guitar.  \\n\\nSchoepp shines up the well-worn clich\u00e9s of singer-songwriterdom and renders them anew. Evoking a series of vivid protagonists and settings (fittingly, each track will have its own accompanying video, solidifying the cinematic quality of this set) his work variously recalls prime Prine (John, that is), the nuances of Newman (Randy, of course), the boozy bonhomie of The Replacements, and the unflinching language of someone well-versed in the Zevonian dialect.    \\n\\nSchoepp mixes fact and family lore to conjure the hardscrabble history \\\"Ballad of Olof Johnson\\\" and chides modern-day wannabes on \\\"Lost Cowboy.\\\" The road story \\\"Ogalalla\\\" answers the question: what happens to your mind when you're snowbound in Nebraska with nothing but a bottle of Nyquil and The Hobbit at the local picture show for company? Meanwhile, the arch love song satire \\\"Talking Girlfriend Blues\\\" deftly explains how to preserve your dignity while hitchhiking to a date \u2013 and what to do when your ride turns out to have eyes for the same girl.\\n\\nElsewhere, \\\"Don't Go\\\" offers a poetic post-9/11 story of love and war; while \\\"Settlin' or Sleepin' Around\\\" questions modern-day swipe right, hook up culture. Schoepp continues his affinity for songs set in hospitals with \\\"Mono Pt. II\\\" \u2013 which explores the kissing disease and the institutional runaround of health care in America (unfortunately a familiar subject for the young man).  And he pays tribute to old friends and outsized characters with \\\"For Jonny\\\" (dedicated to his longtime drummer Jonny Philip) and the heart-rending requiem \\\"Dream.\\\"\\n\\nHaving released his debut on SideOneDummy, Rangers & Valentines is being put out by London-based Xtra Mile Recordings. Hipped to Schoepp's work by fellow singer-songwriter Frank Turner, among others, Xtra Mile honcho Charlie Caplowe quickly signed him to the label.\\n\\nSchoepp \u2013 who's already crisscrossed the country sharing stages with fellow travelers like The Wallflowers, The Jayhawks and The Old 97's \u2013 will be back on the road throughout 2016 in support of Ranger & Valentines, starting with a 3-week run throughout the UK and Europe supporting Jesse Malin.\\n\\nLike the album, it'll be another opportunity to catch a young journeyman at work.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":null,\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"https://www.trapperschoepp.com\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/trapperschoepp\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/trapperschoepp\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"trapperschoepp\"}],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.theroxy.com/event/1179839?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
