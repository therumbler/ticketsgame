Lynn\",\"startTime\":\"2016-11-19 20:00:00\",\"eventDescription\":\"\u201cTo make it in this business, you either have to be first, great or different,\u201d says living legend Loretta Lynn. \u201cAnd I was the first to ever go into Nashville, singin\u2019 it like the women lived it.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tLoretta first arrived in Nashville 55 years ago,  signing her first recording contract on February 1, 1960, and within a matter of weeks, she was at her first recording session.   \\r\\nA self-taught guitarist and songwriter, Lynn became one of the most distinctive performers in Nashville in the 1960s and 1970s, shaking things up by writing her own songs, many of which tackled boundary-pushing topics drawn from her own life experiences as a wife and mother. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to being \u201cfirst,\u201d she was also \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cdifferent.\u201d Loretta Lynn\u2019s instantly recognizable delivery is one of the greatest voices in music history. As for \u201cdifferent,\u201d no songwriter has a more distinctive body of work. In lyrics such as \u201cDon\u2019t Come Home A-Drinkin\u2019\u201d and \u201cYour Squaw Is on the War Path\u201d she refused to be any man\u2019s doormat. She challenged female rivals in \u201cYou Ain\u2019t Woman Enough\u201d and \u201cFist City.\u201d She showed tremendous blue-collar pride in \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re Lookin\u2019 at Country.\u201d She is unafraid of controversy, whether the topic is sex (\u201cWings Upon Your Horns\u201d), divorce (\u201cRated X\u201d), alcohol (\u201cWouldn\u2019t It Be Great\u201d) or war (\u201cDear Uncle Sam\u201d). \u201cThe Pill,\u201d her celebration of sexual liberation, was banned by many radio stations. Like the lady herself, Loretta Lynn\u2019s songs shoot from the hip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs millions who read her 1976 autobiography or saw its Oscar winning 1980 film treatment are aware, Loretta is a Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter who was raised in dire poverty in a remote Appalachian Kentucky hamlet. Living in a mountain cabin with seven brothers and sisters, she was surrounded by music as a child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\u201cI thought everybody sang, because everybody up there in Butcher Holler did,\u201d she recalls. \u201cEverybody in my family sang. So I really didn\u2019t understand until I left Butcher Holler that there were some people who couldn\u2019t. And it was kind of a shock.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tShe famously married Oliver \u201cDoolittle\u201d Lynn when she was a barely schooled child of 13. \u201cDoo\u201d was a 21-year-old war veteran with a reputation as a hell raiser. When she was seven months pregnant with her first child, they moved far away from Appalachia to Custer, Washington. By age 18, she had four children (two more, twins, came along in 1964). Isolated from her native culture and burdened with domestic work, she turned to music for solace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\u201cBefore I was singing, I cleaned house; I took in laundry; I picked berries. I worked seven days a week. I was a housewife and mother for 15 years before I was an entertainer. And it wasn\u2019t like being a housewife today. It was doing hand laundry on a board and cooking on an old coal stove. I grew a garden and canned what I grew. That\u2019s what\u2019s real. I know how to survive.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tDoo heard her singing at her chores and declared that she sounded just as good as anyone he heard on the radio. He bought her a guitar and told her to learn how to play it and write songs with it. Loretta says her songs were so forthright because she didn\u2019t know any better.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\u201cAfter he got me the guitar, I went out and bought a Country Song Roundup. I looked at the songs in there and thought, \u2018Well, this ain\u2019t nothing. Anybody can do this.\u2019 I just wrote about things that happened. I was writing about things that nobody talked about in public, and I didn\u2019t realize that they didn\u2019t. I was having babies and staying at home. I was writing about life. That\u2019s why I had songs banned.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tDoo began pushing her to perform in area nightclubs. Executives from Zero Records heard her in a nightspot across the border in Vancouver, Canada. She soon recorded her debut single, \u201cI\u2019m a Honky Tonk Girl,\u201d for the little label. Loretta made herself a fringed cowgirl outfit, and she and Doo drove across the country in his old Mercury sedan promoting the single at station after station.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAstonishingly, it worked. The disc hit the popularity charts in the summer of 1960 and brought the couple to Music City. She began singing regularly on the Grand Ole Opry after her debut on Oct. 15, 1960. The show\u2019s Wilburn Brothers took her under their wings. Teddy Wilburn helped to polish Loretta\u2019s startlingly original songwriting style. Brother Doyle Wilburn took a tape of her singing \u201cFool #1\u201d to producer Owen Bradley at Decca Records. Owen liked the song, but was already working with Kitty Wells, Goldie Hill, Brenda Lee and Patsy Cline and said he didn\u2019t need another female singer. Teddy told him that he couldn\u2019t have the song if he didn\u2019t sign its singer. As a result, Brenda had a smash pop hit with \u201cFool #1,\u201d and Loretta got a Decca Records contract. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tLike everyone else who encountered her, Owen Bradley was smitten with Loretta\u2019s innocence, individualism, infectious wit, independent spirit, humorous candor, refreshing frankness and immense talent. In fact, he came to regard her as \u201cthe female Hank Williams.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tLoretta\u2019s Decca chart debut came with 1962\u2019s \u201cSuccess.\u201d It became the first of her 51 top-10 hits and led to an invitation to join the Grand Ole Opry cast later that year. Her fellow Opry cast member Patsy Cline taught her how to dress, style her hair and wear make-up. The Wilburns began featuring her on their nationally syndicated TV series. She sang a series of sassy domestic ditties with her childhood hero, Ernest Tubb. As a solo, she hit her stride with \u201cWine, Women and Song\u201d (1964) and \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d (1965), both of them feisty, don\u2019t-step-on-me numbers. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\u201cShe\u2019s the spokesman for the ladies,\u201d observed the late Owen Bradley. \u201cLoretta had a lot of different ideas, and they were very fresh. Women\u2019s lib was also coming on at that time. You have to be in the right place at the right time. And I think Loretta was standing right there.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\u201cMost of my songs were from the women\u2019s point of view,\u201d Loretta wrote in her best-selling autobiography. \u201cThat\u2019s who I\u2019m singing about and singing to during my shows. And the girls know it\u2026.Most of my fan club is women, which is how I want it.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAmong Loretta\u2019s finest moments on disc are such empowering female statements as \u201cYou Wanna Give Me Lift\u201d (1970), \u201cI Wanna Be Free\u201d (1971), \u201cWe\u2019ve Come a Long Way Baby\u201d (1978), \u201cHey Loretta\u201d (1973), \u201cLove Is the Foundation\u201d (1973) and the hilarious \u201cOne\u2019s on the Way\u201d (1972). She memorably romanced and sassed Conway Twitty in a number of hugely popular duet performances in 1970-1982. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIn 1967, she began picking up various Female Vocalist of the Year trophies. She and Conway also won a long string of Duet of the Year awards beginning in 1971, The industry showered her with BMI songwriting honors, Gold Record plaques, a Grammy Award and other accolades. In 1972, she became the first woman in history to win the Country Music Association\u2019s Entertainer of the Year trophy. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBy the mid-1970s, Loretta Lynn was an undeniable superstar. She was featured on the covers of Newsweek (1973), Redbook (1974) and many other mainstream national publications. With her kookie humor, scrambled grammar and unpretentious manner, she became a TV talk-show favorite.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tLoretta continued to dominate the charts as the \u201870s drew to a close, scoring major hits with 1976\u2019s \u201cSomebody Somewhere,\u201d 1977\u2019s \u201cOut of My Head and Back in My Bed\u201d and 1979\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Picture of Us on My Mind.\u201d Her 1982 smash hits \u201cI Lie\u201d and \u201cMaking Love From Memory\u201d carried her into the new decade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOne of the most remarkable things about Loretta Lynn is how she renews her creativity time and again. Two years after she was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1983, she was back on the charts with the hit,  \u201cHeart Don\u2019t Do This to Me.\u201d In 1988, the year she entered the Country Music Hall of Fame, Loretta recorded with k.d. lang. She earned a Gold Record in 1994 with Honky Tonk Angels, a trio CD with Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\tDoo died in 1996. Numb with grief, Loretta admits that she was lost in a fog for more than a year. But she came back again with a 2000 CD titled Still Country. She also returned to the concert trail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, too,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause if I hadn\u2019t, I would have been nuts by now. I would have been completely nuts.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLoretta published a second memoir, Still Woman Enough, in 2002. She was honored at The Kennedy Center in 2003, yet pushed forward again the following year by winning two Grammy Awards for Van Leer Rose, a collaboration with rocker Jack White. Also in 2004, she published a book of recipes and anecdotes titled You\u2019re Cookin\u2019 It Country.\\r\\n\\r\\nLynn is also one of the most awarded musicians of all time. She has been inducted into more music Halls of Fame than any female recording artist, including The Country Music Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and was the first woman to be named the Country Music Association\u2019s Entertainer of the Year in 1972. Lynn received Kennedy Center Honors in 2003 and a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013. She has won four Grammy Awards (including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010) and sold more than 45 million records worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2016, Legacy Recordings will release FULL CIRCLE, Loretta\u2019s  first new studio album in over ten years.  Produced by Patsy Lynn Russell and John Carter Cash, and recorded at the Cash Cabin Studio in Hendersonville, Tennessee, FULL CIRCLE will take listeners on a journey through Loretta's musical story, from the Appalachian folk songs and gospel music she learned as a child, to new interpretations of her classic hits and country standards, to songs newly-written for the project.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThat same month, PBS will also broadcast the  the nationwide premiere of a new documentary about Loretta\u2019s remarkable life and career called American Masters \u2014 Loretta Lynn: Still a Mountain Girl.  The film will explore the country legend\u2019s hard-fought road to stardom. From her Appalachian roots to the Oscar-winning biopic of her life, \\\"Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter,\\\" Lynn struggled to balance family and her music career and is still going strong over 50 years later. \\r\\n\\r\\nLoretta Lynn\u2019s life is still a work in progress. She\u2019s still out there on the road, still writing songs and still recording them as only she can. \u201cI ain\u2019t a star \u2013 a star is something up in the night sky,\u201d says Loretta Lynn. \u201cPeople say to me, \u2018You\u2019re a legend.\u2019 I\u2019m not a legend. I\u2019m just a woman.\",\"isMobileFriendly\":\"false\",\"image\":{\"jumbo\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atjmbo.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":640},\"jumbo1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atjmbo1.jpg\",\"width\":960,\"height\":540},\"large\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atlg.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"large1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atlg1.jpg\",\"width\":300,\"height\":200},\"medium\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atmd.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"medium1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atmd1.jpg\",\"width\":200,\"height\":133},\"original\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-og.jpg\",\"width\":2048,\"height\":1365},\"small\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atsm.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"small1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atsm1.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":67},\"square\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-sq.jpg\",\"width\":100,\"height\":100},\"squareSmall\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-sqsm.jpg\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"xlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atxl.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atxl1.jpg\",\"width\":500,\"height\":333},\"xxlarge\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atxxl.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433},\"xxlarge1\":{\"path\":\"http://cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/02/03/91/43-atxxl1.jpg\",\"width\":650,\"height\":433}},\"youtubeVideos\":[],\"embedAudio\":\"\",\"embedVideo\":\"\",\"urlAudio\":\"\",\"urlPurchaseMusic\":\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/artist/loretta-lynn/id59398?uo=6&at=10ltdS\",\"urlOfficialWebsite\":\"http://www.lorettalynn.com/50/\",\"urlMySpace\":\"\",\"urlFacebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/LorettaLynnOfficial\",\"urlTwitter\":\"http://twitter.com/the_lorettalynn\",\"twitterScreenName\":\"the_lorettalynn\"}],\"supports\":[],\"urlEventDetailsUrl\":\"http://www.thelincolndc.com/event/1162609?utm_medium=api\"}]}",
