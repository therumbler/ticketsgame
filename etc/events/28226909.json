She has a powerful yet subtle stage presence that allows her to assume and project a different persona and character in each song. Malena was born and raised in Buenos Aires. She sang tango since she can remember, and she studied music in Buenos Aires and in Mannes College of Music in New York. Malena also sings opera, and performed in Carnegie Hall in New York, at the Sacred Music Festival in Rome, the Israeli Opera House and the Teatro Municipal de Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\u00a0David Rosenmeyer\u2019s arrangements bring to the mix elements of classical music, traditional tango, improvisation, and contemporary music techniques such as minimalism combined with an avant-garde sense of experimentation. David was born in Argentina and started studying music in Israel, where he lived as a child. As an orchestral conductor, David worked with orchestras in Italy, Hungary, Israel, Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Argentina and made his debut in Carnegie Hall conducting the Oratorio Society of New York. David is also a pianist, composer and educator.Born in Jerusalem and raised in Buenos-Aires and Tel-Aviv, Or Bareket is quickly establishing himself as one of the most versatile bassists on the NYC jazz scene. Winner of the 1st prize at the International Society of Bassists' jazz competition in 2011, Or\u2019s diverse heritage informs his distinct style. His approach to improvisation is informed by Mediterranean, South American, and North African folklores, all interpreted through his deep knowledge and appreciation of the American Jazz traditionhttp://www.newaires.com/",
