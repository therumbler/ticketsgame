These are allocated on a first come first served basis, so if you'd like a seat, please ensure you arrive early.\n\nWe reserve the right to release all unclaimed tickets for re-sale at 9.15pm. If you will be arriving after this time, please inform us in advance, so that we can hold your tickets for you.\nWe can be contacted by email on mail@greennote.co.uk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhen Cam Penner and Jon Wood toured over here in 2015, the reviews were as glowing as the performances and followed them wherever they went. Maverick writer Paul Kerr said they were mesmerising, while (writing at AmericanaUK), Mike Ritchie said: Masterful - an utterly compelling duo - brilliant!\n\nThey were flown in from their base in Canada for their sold-out headline show at Celtic Connections Festival after winning major TV exposure when tracks from the sensational To Build A Fire album were chosen as the backdrop to the BBC 2 TV drama based on Iain Banks' Stonemouth novel.\n\nThe latest release - Sex & Politics - confirmed them as a creative tour de force.\n\nSimply superb - an album that'll be making more than a few end-of-year best of lists, said AmericananUK, while Acoustic magazine called it totally glorious and added: it's maybe as fine as music's likely to get in 2016. R2 magazine called it a work of outstanding genius.\n\nPenner has that rare quality  a well-grounded human spirit. In another life he might have been a Shaman. With constant playing companion Jon Wood (a highly respected producer in Canada) by his side, percussive elements and layered guitar techniques have added rich texture. Those Shamans also dance around  and beat the drum - sometimes.\n\n\nQuite brilliant  No Depression\n\nStunning  The Daily Express",
