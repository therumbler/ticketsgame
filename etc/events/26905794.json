The result is a musician hailed by D\u00f3nal Lunny as the most important traditional singer to emerge in recent years.\n\nAlthough the only singer/musician in his immediate family, Daoir\u00ed was introduced to the music at a very early age by his parents who shared a keen interest in artists such as Christy Moore, Andy Irvine, Frank Harte, Planxty and The Bothy Band and more.  Daoir\u00ed took up music himself at the relatively late age of 16 and only started to perform at 23, but he has come a long way since then and the early release of his accomplished debut album 'The First Turn', in 2009.  \n\n'The First Turn, could well prove to be a winner for Daoir\u00ed Farrell' Irish Music Magazine.",
