            "description": "An intimate evening with Masontown\nThis is an all acoustic \"house concert\" style setting. Feel free to bring your own.\nDoors 7pm Show 7:30\n$20 Advance $23 at the door\nAll sales final. No refunds.\u00a0\nA new and enchanting sound has emerged from the hotbed of the Colorado roots music scene. Masontown, a young band with a concept as timeless as the Rocky Mountains, has alighted onto a bluegrass community that has already produced some of the best that the acoustic music world has to offer. But Colorado, and the wider world of modern music, hasn\u2019t quite heard this yet. A lauded fiddle champion and classical violinist. A veteran bluegrass mandolin player and composer. One of Colorado\u2019s jazz guitar greats reborn as a flatpicking sensation. An upright bassist with roots running deep in the classical and jazz traditions. These are the individual elements that come together to create Masontown. Masontown\u2019s sound is a exciting take on the American acoustic tradition. At once fresh and familiar, the group unites the sounds of bluegrass, old-time, folk, and new acoustic music into a sonic melting pot that hearkens back to our deep musical traditions while remaining defiantly modern in conception. Echoes of the poignant exploration of the Matt Flinner Trio blend with the fierce drive of Bill Monroe and the plaintive songcraft of Cahalen Morrison and Eli West. It\u2019s no surprise that the members of Masontown have shared the stage with many of these musical icons that their sound evokes. The listening halls and dance floors of Colorado have already begun to hail the arrival of this new force in the acoustic music community. Masontown is a band on the move, driven to delight the ears, touch the hearts, and move the feet of generations of music lovers in Colorado and far beyond.\nEric Wiggs (guitar/vocals) Mike Canney (mandolin) Natalie Padilla (fiddle/vocals) Bradley Morse (bass)\n\"Masontown is 4 corners of great music. 4 musicians hold up a new sound, delivering the creative reharmonization of a tenured melody. This progressive and heartening aesthetic is sure to last.\" - Eli West (Cahalen Morrison & Eli West)\n\"Masontown\u2019s music is as high energy as the mountains they hail from! Their repertoire consists of delightful renditions of classic Bluegrass songs paired with exciting original tunes. The 'nationally acclaimed' fiddling is highly engaging and the talent and sheer joy of the musicians is striking!\" - Bridget Law (Elephant Revival)\n\"This is a very tight band. They\u2019re writing really cool tunes, great arrangements and playing with a confidence and taste usually reserved for the recording studio. Young bands rarely sound so cohesive! The Front Range has a new group to be reckoned with.\" - Grant Gordy (Mr. Sun)",
