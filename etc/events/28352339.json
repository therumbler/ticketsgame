            "description": "IAN ETHAN CASEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TlsJCqf5NMBoston-based multi-instrumentalist Ian Ethan Case, best known for his innovative approach to the 18-string acoustic double-neck guitar, has been performing in listening rooms across the country for the past eight years and is increasingly gaining recognition both for his unique instrumental compositions and for the highly original playing methods which are required to perform them.\u00a0One of only about five musicians worldwide to tackle the double-neck guitar in earnest, he fluidly combines a variety of self-invented playing techniques necessitated by his multi-layered compositions, which, taken together, have begun to establish the instrument's musical validity perhaps more so than the work of any other artist. While audiences consistently remark on the fascinating visual aspects of watching Ian play \"as he rambunctiously weaves between fretboards, slapping and tapping the sounds of the guitar to life seemingly effortlessly in a style that you've likely never seen before\" (Port Orchard Independent), his unusual methods are simply byproducts of the rich, heartfelt, and powerfully uplifting music that he writes and plays.\u00a0GRAYSON ERHARDhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mENu5R62l5cGrayson Erhard is a singer / songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from the small town of Del Norte, CO, USA known for his songs showcasing vocals accompanied by a unique style of tap/slap guitar playing. He is the youngest guitarist to be featured on one of the world\u2019s most prestigious guitar-focused record labels, CandyRat Records.Growing up outside of a town with a population of 1,800, Erhard experienced little distraction from developing his musicianship. His music communicates a message of self-sustainability, anxiety, love, and accomplishment. Early songs like \u201cTapestry\u201d display a writing style where technical guitar performance is combined with metaphorical lyrics. However, after putting the guitar down to learn other instruments, a new love for simplicity and strong, direct messages developed in his music. His lyrics are a public journal spanning from positive, uplifting material to songs that reflect the challenges often faced by people in unhealthy relationships, dodgy living situations and searching for happiness.",
