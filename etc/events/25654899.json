        "description": "* Door 7pm\n\n* DJ FlapJackDavey 7 - 8pm and 11pm onwards\n\n* Live music 8-11pm includes two sets from Thomas McCarthy, plus songs from local traditional singers\n\n* Concessionary tickets are for the unwaged (ie no paid employment) - proof required at the door on the night. Please note that we have an allocation of ten concessionary online tickets for each of our concerts - first come first served!\n\n* Tickets on the door (where still available) will  be priced at \u00a311/9\n\n* Mix of row seats and standing room. \n\n* Seats are not reserved, and a ticket may not always guarantee a seat, although there will be standing room. IF HAVING A SEAT IS ESSENTIAL TO YOU, PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU ARE THERE WHEN THE DOOR OPENS AT 7PM, AS THE ROOM FILLS UP QUICKLY FOR POPULAR CONCERTS. We will not be able to bring in extra seats.\n\n* Children are welcome provided they  sit quietly without disturbing other members of the audience. If you are unsure about this, please contact us before buying tickets for children.\n\n* Food and real ale available! Please note that you will not be able to eat in the ballroom where the concert is held, although once the doors open you may reserve a seat in the ballroom and then eat elsewhere. If you wish to eat, please ensure that you arrive in plenty of time to order and eat your food.\n\n* For more information or to contact the Goose please see our website www.thegooseisout.com",
