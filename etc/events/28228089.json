        "description": "Leftover Dreams\u00a0is Patrice Haan and Tony Marcus singing gems of the great American songbook with stunning harmonies and burnished accompaniment. Tony Marcus is a veteran of such groups as Cats & Jammers and the Cheap Suit Serenaders and plays guitar with style and wit while singing in a voice that has been called \"The definition of mellifluous\" (Derk Richardson in the\u00a0East Bay Express). Patrice Haan's voice has been described as a \"velvety alto/tenor\" (Kerry Parker in the\u00a0Folknik), and her intimate delivery of lyrics never fails to reach audiences.The two of them, along with reed player extraordinaire Jeff Sanford (leader of the Cartoon Jazz Orchestra), present a sampling of the best of the classic songs of Jimmy Van Heusen, the Gershwins, Harold Arlen and such mixed with lesser known delights that haven't seen the light of day for decades. As for the playing,\u00a0\"Marcus spins out dazzling and emotionally evocative solos\" (Derk Richardson again). Jeff Sanford has performed with such jazz greats as Clark Terry, Regina Carter, Stan Getz and Tootie Heath, and brings his delight at playing music to all his performances.",
