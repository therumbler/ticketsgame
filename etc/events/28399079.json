        "description": "Noise Complaint and Kremwerk are very proud to present:&nbsp;JIMMY EDGAR (ULTRAMAJIC / Hotflush / !K7 / Warp, Berlin - Detroit)http://www.jimmyedgar.comhttps://soundcloud.com/jimmyedgarhttps://www.facebook.com/jimmyedgar&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to his solo persona, parting ways with Warp, and relocating to Berlin, Edgar released his next album XXX on !K7 records in 2010. On XXX, Edgar refined his mutant electro-funk into its most radio-friendly form, and the singles &quot;Hot, Raw, Sex&quot; and &quot;Turn You Inside Out&quot; became essential dance cuts. Encouraged by his friendship with Machinedrum (part of Sepalcure with Braille), in 2012 Jimmy released the LP Majenta on Scuba&#39;s Hotflush label.&nbsp;Majenta&#8217;s blend of airbrushed 80s futurism and otherwordly sensuality, co-created with recent collaborator and kindred spirit Pilar Zeta, visually expresses Edgar&#39;s obsession with spirituality, technology, and the occult. Moved by a transformative trip to Peru&#8217;s fabled Machu Picchu, the lifelong transcendence fetishist hopes to rekindle a similar passion for the supernatural in newer audiences.&nbsp;As part of that mission, In 2013 Edgar and Machinedrum co-founded Ultramajic, a label and collective for their various projects. In addition to their work as DJ duo JETS, Stewart will provide A&amp;R to the label; their first release will be Edgar&#39;s 3-track EP Hot Inside out in June. A complimentary deck of magical cards created by Zeta and Edgar will be released shortly after the album. Edgar is touring independently and with JETS all summer.&nbsp;At an age when many artists are just coming into their own, Edgar is more secure in his artistic vision than ever. Most importantly, after years of shape-shifting into others&#39; molds, Jimmy Edgar is now in full control.&nbsp;&nbsp;LOCAL SUPPORT FROM:&nbsp;FooFouSubset&nbsp;21+&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8212;-&nbsp;NOISE COMPLAINT&nbsp;As Electronic Dance Music has exploded in popularity over the last several years, so have clubs, festivals, ticket prices, and egos along with it. In the beginning, dance music related events were held in underground, often intimate venues. It was about the music, and it was about each other.&nbsp;Gone are those days, seemingly. With every club and festival being so overcrowded and oversold, one begins to ask if it is even about the music anymore. We want to bring it back to its roots. We want to bring in top quality talent, at a small price in an intimate space. We want it to be about the music and we want it to be about you.&nbsp;Noise Complaint is more than &quot;another show&quot;. It is a party for the people, by the people. An event where the music is the centerpiece - and a small, intimate venue creates a vibe that rises above all.&nbsp;Join us on this journey, become part of our family, and help us create an experience that seems far too gone any more. You can find us at Kremwerk in Seattle where we&#39;ll be dancing to a wide range of some of the finest house and techno on the planet.&nbsp;Noise Complaint - WE HEAR YOU.",
