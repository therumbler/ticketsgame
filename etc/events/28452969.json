        "description": "Hans Koller (Valve Trombone, Euphonium)\nMartin Speake (Alto Saxophone)\nCalum Gourlay (Bass)\nTBC (Drums)\n\nTaking inspiration from the Steve Lacy/Roswell Rudd School Days band from the early 1960s, Thelonious explore the entire Monk repertoire with both childlike curiosity as well as forensic attention to detail.Through collective learning of Monk's unique catalogue of 70 tunes from the complete original recordings in a slow process lasting several months of regular playing, probing, rehearsing, reflecting, memorising, meditating, internalising and improvising, Thelonious arrive at flexible interpretations of the material that are as dangerous as anything in contemporary music, as well as comforting, groovy and dreamy.\n\nMartin has worked extensively with Monk alumnus Paul Motian (Check out Martin's ECM recording with him, Change of Heart), and Hans has played and recorded with the original Monk repertoire guru Steve Lacy (London Ear). Calum and David are two of the most melodic and cutting-edge rhythm players active on the London jazz scene today, perfects partners in the exploration of Monk's music.\n\nThelonious are delighted to be playing the Vortex downstairs Cafe every second Sunday in the month after the London Jazz Orchestra, from 6pm to 8pm",
