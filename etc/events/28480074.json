        "description": "Robin Elliott \n\nThis is a gentle look at a harsh world. There's a tension in that contradiction which makes his music particularly interesting. Robin Elliott is working in a folk tradition because his music is rooted in a narrative tradition, his lyrics have something to say. (Folk Radio UK)\n\nCordelia Stephens\n\nCordelia Stephens is an English-American folk artist whose voice combines power and vulnerability, and whose incisive songwriting explores the contradictions of modern life and love drawing on her musical influences such as Aimee Mann and Gillian Welch. Her sophomore album Wide Awake Dream produced by Riley McMahon at New Warsaw Studio, NY was released on October 15th, 2016. Her debut album- Threshold also produced by Riley McMahon- was officially released in a sold-out show at The Living Room in 2012.\n\nSullivan & Gold\n\nSullivan & Gold released their debut album 'For Foes' in 2013 to critical acclaim. The album received airplay on Radio 1, Radio Ulster, RTE Radio 1 and was nominated for the 2014 Northern Ireland Music Prize. \n\nSullivan & Gold have toured and played in many unusual venues/spaces; including Tipperary bookshops, a Derry thatched cottage and a Norwich cathedral. Most recently, Sullivan & Gold travelled to some of the UK's most remote islands off the west coast of Scotland on a yacht to film a musical tour of the Inner Hebrides.\n\nTom Sail",
