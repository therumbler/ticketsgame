        "description": "\"The Yes Mess practice a dark stem of alternative folk which is energetic and mysterious. It's uplifting and real. Great lyrics, surreal images, dark and unique sounds.\" (The Lantern Society) \n\n\"An enigmatic, folky, funky, hook laden five piece that rattle the same hallucinatory cages as the Beta Band at their oddest, with elements of Syd's Pink Floyd in the mix.\" (The Gladstone)\n\nHouse Above The Sun\n\nHouse Above The Sun are a London based roots rock group led by singer/songwriter Jim Moreton. Distinguished by rich male/female harmonies and inventive guitar hooks, their melodic & poetic songs are played with a stripped down, heartfelt approach, ranging from bittersweet country soul balladry to blues fueled guitar epics. \n\nShevek\n\nShevek is Tristram Bawtree of Eyes & No Eyes (Willkommen Collective), singing songs about care-work, the Id, and trying to act natural when you feel unnatural.\n\nHe combines the hushed romanticism of Nick Drake with the sonic inventiveness of Arthur Russell or Mount Eerie.\n\nHenry Tozer\n\nLondon based musician and multi instrumentalist who performs professionally as a pianist, singer and guitarist, and also works as a songwriter and film composer.\n\nHis music has been used for many films such as Demolition (2016), starring Jake Gyllenhaal, and My Blind Brother (2016), starring Adam Scott. \nHis debut album, 'Dreams of a Distant Land', will be released in July 2016.\n\n&#8203; Henry grew up in Devon, was a music student and choral scholar at Cambridge University and lived in New York City for a couple of years. His music is informed by his regular meditation retreats and gains inspiration from buddhism and reflecting. &#8203;",
