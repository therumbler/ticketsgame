        "description": "North Georgia musician Jonathan Ingram launched his solo career in late\u00a02014 after having spent several years fronting the regional standout band Stonethrow. In July of 2015 Jonathan\u00a0released his debut album 'Better Late Than Never', earned a spot at CMA Fest 2015 and 2016 in Nashville, won the Georgia regional round of the American Country Showcase, was named a finalist for the 2015 GA Country Awards, and has become one of the most sought after acts in the southeastern nightlife scene. Dating back to his time with Stonethrow, Jonathan has steadily toured the Southeastern US, sharing the stage with nationally touring acts including Chris Stapleton, Keith Anderson, Candlebox, Fuel, and more. Jonathan has recently announced that his 2nd album 'Whiskey Business' is scheduled to be released in the Summer of 2016.Prior to the release of the solo album 'Better Late Than Never',\u00a0the majority of Jonathan's original work had been of the alternative rock variety. The concept behind launching a solo project was to explore a number of his influences without the boundaries and stigmas attached any certain genre. The belief was that by reaching into his vast variety of influences that the culmination would create a unique style all his own. The result was a modern country/rock sound highlighted by elements of traditional country, pop/rock and edgier rock sounds.Variety remains a staple for Jonathan's live show, showcasing his ability to cross over a multitude of genres creating a 'something for everyone' tone to the experience. Whether its an intimate setting, a rocking festival set, or a full house Friday night in the clubs, expect a load of surprises and unique takes on some of your favorites as well as falling in love with some brand new material as well!",
