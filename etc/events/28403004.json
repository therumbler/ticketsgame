        "description": "The 2nd Annual Healing Hands Helping Heroes event will benefit the Association of PeriOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) Middle Tennessee Chapter and REBOOT Combat Recovery and is set to take place Thursday, November 10, 2016 at The Rosewall (1120 McGavock St) with cocktails at 6:00 p.m., dinner buffet and program at 7:00 p.m. and entertainment to follow at 8:00 p.m. \nAORN is a non-profit membership association based in Denver, Colorado that represents the interests of more than 160,000 perioperative nurses by providing nursing education, standards, and clinical practice resources. AORN defines and advances the best nursing practices for surgical patients by researching and distributing scientifically based guidelines. AORN's mission is to promote safety and optimal outcomes for patients undergoing operative and other invasive procedures by providing practice support and professional development opportunities to perioperative nurses. AORN collaborates with professional and regulatory organizations, industry leaders, and other health care partners who support the mission. The funds raised during this event will provide scholarships for nurses to receive continuing education and certification through the AORN program.\nThe REBOOT Recovery program is a non-profit organization that provides completely free services for participants. REBOOT exists to address the often overlooked spiritual aspects of combat trauma. Their programs speak to issues of identity, false guilt, forgiveness and building an environment of healing by connecting the hurting with the Healer. REBOOT Recovery also partners with many government and non-profit based providers to complete care. On a regular basis they refer members to local counseling or therapy resources and partner with them to deliver meaningful outcomes. A large percentage of members come to the program as referrals from VA or Army medical facilities. As a program locally approved by Army and VA systems, they are continuing to raise awareness about the importance of spiritual care as a service member heals from the wounds of war. Since 2011, REBOOT has served over 400 service members in locations at Ft Campbell, KY, Camp Lejeune, NC, Oklahoma City, Clarksville, and Nashville.\n\nCall: 615-669-6058 for details.",
