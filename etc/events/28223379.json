        "description": "On his 6th album release,\u00a0Stolen Tools & Stereos, Oakland songwriter Joe Rut's quirky sense of humor underpins a heartfelt, richly lyrical and subtly hallucinatory Americana/Alt-country tapestry.\u00a0Special guests, including mandolin great David Grisman (Jerry Garcia, Old and In The Way, David Grisman Quintet) and pedal steel master Bobby Black (Commander Cody, Asleep at the Wheel), augment Joe\u2019s band as he drunk dials his friends at\u00a03 AM\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0morning, sings an abandoned black-velvet Elvis painting back home to Tupelo, pictures all his earthly belongings for sale at a flea market after his death, and ponders the tragic mating rituals of porcupines.\u00a0It is a deeply American music, although the border guards seem to have been bribed with psychedelics to look the other way.\u00a0Much of the album was written in a year-long road trip, during which Joe travelled the main streets and backroads of California with his dog Potato in a converted Ford Econoline Van, writing songs daily in The Pretty Good Book, a 3-inch thick antique accounting ledger given to him by friends for the trip.\n\u201cThey told me to fill it up. I filled 200 pages. It needed a name. I thought it was better than pretty good,\u201d\u00a0 says Joe, \u201cbut \u2018The Good Book\u2019 was already taken, so\u2026\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The lion's share of yet another (soon to be released) album was recorded with portable equipment in the van itself and in other venues while on the road, and Joe plans to debut and record more songs from The Pretty Good Book at the shows to celebrate the release of\u00a0Stolen Tools & Stereos.Highlighting his eclecticism, Joe\u2019s fans have compared him to influences as disparate as Todd Snider, The Band, They Might be Giants, The Grateful Dead, Loudon Wainright III, Frank Zappa, and the Meat Puppets.\u00a0His live shows have earned him a cult-status among those in the know, as a crafty guitarist and a songwriter who disarms the listener with humor while striking to the heart of the matter, often accompanied by Chatbot 1984, a drug-addled 1980\u2019s talking toy robot with a WD-40 addiction.\u00a0Joe has headlined the San Francisco\u2019s Great American Music Hall, and in his various bands, he has played at England's Glastonbury Music Festival, San Francisco\u2019s famed Fillmore (opening for Richard Thompson), the second stages at Shoreline and Sleep Train Amphitheatres (opening for Alabama), Nevada\u2019s Burning Man Festival and Santa Cruz\u2019s Y2K5 Live Looping Festival.\u00a0",
