She is self-taught on the banjo and plays clawhammer and three-finger picking style. After learning how to play the instrument by playing old-timey and bluegrass covers, Banjaline started writing her own music. Influences include Buell Kazee, The SteelDrivers, Clarence Ashley, Doc Watson, and Mike Seeger. The style of her music could be described as Americana, Southern Gothic, or Outlaw Country. Common themes of her songs are moonshine, murder, traveling, hauntings, horror, drinking, and animals. Banjaline performs solo or with a backing band featuring a saw. Her performance history started with the Stovetop Ramblers in late 2013, and she was part of HotHouse Peaches in 2014/2015.\n\nBanjaline Official Site\nBanjaline on Facebook",
