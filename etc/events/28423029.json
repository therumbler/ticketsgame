        "description": "Boots On Stage Presents a showcase featuring up-and-coming Los Angeles based country music artists. Performances by: Daniel Bonte, Dani Rose, Heather Jeanette, Golden West and Curt Chambers. DJ Sean Cvtter will be spinning your favoite country hits, and a little hip-hop too. Looking forward to seeing you and thank you for supporting LA Country! #BootsOnStage\nDANIEL BONTE//Bo-na Fide adj. : real or genuine LAW: made or done in an honest or sincere way// Taking their moniker to heart, Daniel Bonte & The Bona Fide are leading the charge to bring original & organic Rock Country to Southern California. Their sound has evolved from years of solo and collaborative songwriting, live performances, jam sessions after a double-shift, late nights with Jack Daniels, heartbreak, and feel good \"Moments.\" It\u2019s not your ordinary country and that's fine by them. If you like rock & roll, soul, blues, and the stories of country music then the Bona Fide will get your stamp of approval.\nThe Bona Fide recently partnered with Sunlane Music Management, and are set to release their highly anticipated follow up EP entitled \"Easy Kind Of Livin\" in November 2016. Daniel had a strong 2016 with main stage appearances opening for Josh Abbott Band, Easton Corbin, Chase Rice, and Cody Johnson throughout the southwest. A small tour up the central coast of California is scheduled for November, followed by a headlining slot for the 3rd annual California Christmas show featuring A Thousand Horses. The Bona Fide are already currently booking dates for festivals in 2017, and planning a Texas to Tennessee tour to help push the release of their new music.\nDANI ROSE\u201cI KNOW IT\u2019S HARD TO COMPARE ANYBODY TO THIS SUPERSTAR\u2019S VOICE, BUT DANI HAS A CARRIE UNDERWOOD FEEL, IT\u2019S REALLY POWERFUL\u201d\u2013 ST. PIERRE, WPOC 93.1\nThe past few years have been a whirlwind of hard work, hustle and accomplishment for Dani Rose.\u00a0 As a TV Show Host for PBS's music video program Strictly Global on MHz Networks, producer of her own music videos with distribution on national television, a solo artist supporting Grammy Award winners Leeann Rimes, Marc Cohn and Top 40's Matt Nathanson, and her original songs featured on A&E, ABC & HBO -\u00a0Dani has been hard at work.\u00a0 Originally from Chantilly, Virginia,\u00a0Dani and her family moved to Tokyo, Japan when she entered the 5th grade, and spent her formative years overseas and abroad.\u00a0 The family returned to Virginia when she was in High School and Dani went on to Virginia Tech for college and graduated with a Bachelors degree in English and Musical Analysis.\u00a0 With a passion for performing, in 2009 Dani completed perhaps one of her most entertaining accomplishments, winning the legendary NYC Amateur Night at the Apollo with a rendition of Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u201cChain of Fools\u201d. \u00a0 A girl that once going, never stops,\u00a0Dani has been featured several times at the Sunset Sessions Radio Film & TV Showcase and has performed live on a myriad of NBC, FOX & WUSA morning news and talk programs. \u00a0Her songs have been featured in film and tv with notable placements on A&E's TEACH: \u00a0Tony Danza, ABC's General Hospital, and the indie film The Umbrealla Man.

She plans on releasing more music and touring next year. For more information or to connect with Heather Jeanette you can visit her Facebook, Instagram, or Youtube, as well as join the mailing list.\nGOLDEN WESTIf a duo or a band has ever lived up to their name, Golden West definitely qualifies in that description. Comprised of Brittany Knott and Taylor Nash, the duo exemplifies all that one identifies as the California sound \u2013 a wide open, melodious approach buoyed by the pair\u2019s pristine and airtight harmonies. According to Knott, the old saying \u201cPractice Makes Perfect\u201d surely applies, as they have been\u00a0honing their craft for close to a decade.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been playing together for about eight years now. We started playing in college our freshman year. We were just hanging out and jamming, and it turned into this songwriting and duo.\u201dThe two actually met while attending Point Loma University in San Diego. Knott recalls that one of the things that brought them together was their love of music.\u00a0\u201cWe both have always loved music, and have had some of the same influences, but also a lot of different ones. I think that the thing that drew us together was that we could come together on those common grounds, but he would show me stuff that I never heard or had listened to before, and vice versa. For us, that was cool, because it showed us a different side of music that we had never heard.\u201dNash says the two bonded over a wide variety of artists \u2013 ranging from Dolly Parton and Shania Twain to Fleetwood Mac and The Eagles. He added that his separate influences run the gamut even more.\u201cI really liked the alternative rock and the classic rock \u2013 this is L.A., after all. On the country side, I love the new guys, as well as the Bakersfield sound. The nice thing about living here in LA is that we get to listen to a little bit of everything.\u201dEach of those diverse musical influences come to the forefront of the Golden West sound. Their infectious debut single, \u201cPCH\u201d (Pacific Coast Highway) is a fine example of this \u2013 with the imprint of California written all over it.Golden West manages to capture that roll-down-the-window feel of the highway that has captivated the world\u2019s attention for years. What is it about that 655 mile stretch of road that runs from Orange County to Mendocino Country that inspired them to write the song?\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most scenic and beautiful drives in the world,\u201d exclaims Nash. \u201cWe\u2019re just blessed that we live so close to it. It\u2019s the one road in LA that you don\u2019t mind if there is traffic. There\u2019s no false advertising the beauty of it.\u201d Knott agrees with her partner, adding that there is something about driving the route that just makes you feel good. \u201cIt\u2019s so iconic. It\u2019s one of those roads that people from across the world come to drive on. It lives up to its\u2019 name. On it, you feel free and careless.\u201dThat same adrenaline rush is something that Golden West feels when they are on the stage. Taylor Nash says \u201cWe have a lot of high energy. That\u2019s one thing that people say a lot about us,\u201d while Knott admits that feeding off an audience is something they don\u2019t take for granted one bit. \u201cWe love playing live, and the fans are so awesome. When we get on stage, they radiate so much energy that combined with our excitement, it makes for a fun show.\u201dGolden West approaches their music with a hands-on touch. They write their own music, and record and track everything in their own studio. When asked about their approach to crafting a song, Nash says \u201cIt varies. Sometimes, we sit down and can write one in fifteen minutes, and other times, it might be a little more difficult. We really approach every song differently.\u201dIt\u2019s that approach to creative detail that also comes into play on their tight harmonies, of which Knott says \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to find that someone that you click with in music. We worked with so many different people over the years, and it just worked with each other right off the bat from a vocal level.\u201d She says that also goes for writing together. \u201cWe just have a lot of the same ideas about the way we say things. A lot of times, we\u2019ll agree to write a separate verse by ourselves, and they usually come out the same. It\u2019s like we read each other\u2019s minds. It just works. There\u2019s no other way to describe it.\u201d Both Knott and Nash have been collaborating with some of Nashville\u2019s top songwriters, and aim to keep progressing as tunesmiths.As far as their career from a business standpoint, Knott says their goals for the future are simple. When asked where she would like to see Golden West in the future, she didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have a song or two on the radio doing well. Hopefully, we can go out touring doing as many shows as we can for as many people. To have the fans be moved by our music\u2026that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about for us.\u201d\nCURT CHAMBERSCurt Chambers\u00a0is an American singer, song writer, producer and recording artist who has gained notoriety for his unique fusions of rock, soul, country and hip hop.
