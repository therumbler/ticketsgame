        "description": "Celebrating their 25th anniversary this year, the California Guitar Trio will bring their holiday show to Atlanta's Red Light Caf\u00e9, presented by Windstorm Productions. Since 1991, California Guitar Trio has enthralled listeners with a singular sound that fearlessly crisscrosses genres. The trio\u2019s questing spirit drives it to explore the intersections between rock, jazz, classical, and world music. It even throws in the occasional surf or spaghetti Western tune for good measure.\n\n$20 Adv \u2013 $25 Door\nDoors @ 7:30 PM\n\nAll ticket sales are final. No refunds.\n\nThe universe of guitar knows no boundaries for The California Guitar Trio. Since 1991, the group has enthralled listeners with a singular sound that fearlessly crisscrosses genres. The trio\u2019s questing spirit drives it to explore the intersections between rock, jazz, classical, and world music. It even throws in the occasional surf or spaghetti Western tune for good measure.\n\nComprised of Bert Lams, Hideyo Moriya and Paul Richards, the group has established a unique, personal connection with audiences. In addition to dazzling musicianship and interplay, The California Guitar Trio's (CGT) shows are full of captivating stories and humor that enable concertgoers to feel like they're part of the music, not just spectators. In fact, the group\u2019s goal is to transcend their instruments, so people focus on the music first, and its considerable technical prowess a distant second.\n\nCGT's 14 albums, streamed over 53 million times on Pandora, offer diverse snapshots of the group\u2019s mercurial muse. The trio\u2019s most recent release Masterworks showcases its classical side, with expansive takes on Bach, Beethoven, Arvo P\u00e4rt, and Schubert. Other highlights include Andromeda, which combines their many influences into a visionary album of original material; CG3+2, an exploration of kinetic rock territory in collaboration with bassist Tony Levin and drummer Pat Mastelotto; and Echoes, which reimagines timeless material by artists such as Mike Oldfield, Penguin Caf\u00e9 Orchestra, Pink Floyd, and Queen.\n\nThe trio\u2019s output has made a major global impact, having served as the soundtrack for Olympics coverage, and programs on CNN, CBS, NBC, and ESPN. They have fans in high places too: Nasa used their music to wake the crew aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour.\n\nCGT's lineup is truly the sum of its distinct parts: A Utah native now residing in Los Angeles, Paul Richards immersed himself in rock, blues, jazz, and folk during his early days and while attending The University of Utah\u2019s jazz guitar program. Bert Lams, originally from Belgium, graduated from the prestigious Royal Conservatory of Music in Brussels, specializing in classical guitar. Tokyo-born Hideyo Moriya began his guitar journey with surf music and British rock, before relocating to Boston to study at Berklee.\n\nAll three felt the call to push themselves to the limit by enrolling in Robert Fripp\u2019s challenging Guitar Craft courses, where they first met in 1987. They went on to tour together as part of Fripp\u2019s League of Crafty Guitarists, before forming the California Guitar Trio in Los Angeles four years later.\n\nRecently, the trio expanded its collaborative possibilities by working within a six-guitar format with the Montreal Guitar Trio. During these groundbreaking, highly-entertaining shows, the acts perform inventive arrangements of each other\u2019s repertoire, and new music for guitar sextet.\n\n25 years and 1,600+ gigs later, the CGT remains intensely committed to explore, evolve and communicate a wide-ranging musical worldview.\n\nCalifornia Guitar Trio Official Site\nCalifornia Guitar Trio on Facebook\nCalifornia Guitar Trio on Apple Music",
