        "description": "Emmet Scanlan & What the Good Thought are an Independent music act whose music veers away from the usual yet is embraced by all of those who hear it. The sound is influenced by old soul, blues and rock and roll. The band are based in London but has members from the U.K., New Zealand and Emmet himself being from Ireland.\n\nThey have played numerous prestigious festivals worldwide : The Wickerman Festival (Scotland), The Electric Picnic (Ireland) and The International Folk Alliance (USA). The list of artists they have supported is diverse in style and includes Femi Kuti, Badly Drawn Boy and The Saw Doctors.\n\nFri, Nov 18th sees the London release of our new EP - These are the dreams, This is the life.\nIt is a collection of songs that explores the idea of the realisation that we are living and working in our dreams, not running towards them. Basically, it is about living in the Now.\n\nThe bands reputation for an amazing live performance ensures a special night ahead, with close friends chosen for special guest performance",
