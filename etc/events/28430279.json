Dreampop, electronic psychedelism, trip-hop...a rough diamond that will make you think of Kate Bush, Grimes, The Knife! Make sure you don't miss her! \n\" the multi-instrumentalist conjured up a world of magic that fell somewhere in between Sung Tongs-era Animal Collective being reimagined by Bat For Lashes.\" THE 405\n\nThe venue you already know.
