But it was his stunning performance of the title track of the O Holy Night album that led to his most enduring legacy, his annual Christmas concert.\n\nIn 1995, Berry\u2019s single Your Love Amazes Me earned him a Granny nomination, joining the 18 other hit songs of his that made it to the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. In fact, many of Berry\u2019s albums have gone gold and platinum, earning awards from the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. Still, for Berry, the Christmas concert is special, as it provides him with a chance to share his faith and, according to his website, he views his performances as part of \u201chis walk with Christ, (where) his calling has been to share God\u2019s love with his audience.\u201d Fans across the nation agree, as he sells out each stop on a regular basis, joining together to celebrate with song and good company what the season means to them \u2013 family, friends and faith.
