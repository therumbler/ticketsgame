        "description": "Cardboard Fox are hard to categorise. All four musicians have roots in bluegrass music but their collective influences reach much further and this shows in their music. Formed in late 2013, this is a group of musicians who are very, very excited about what this line up can create and that's what makes this acoustic quartet so special. With a focus on original writing and re-imagined folk songs taken from a very different perspective, this band is not to be missed.\n\nJohn Breese, primarily a classical guitarist as well as one of the country's top banjo players, is fast establishing himself as an in-demand double bassist, most recently with The Carrivick Sisters.\n\nCharlotte Carrivick began learning to flat pick the guitar at the age of 14, having previously played classical guitar and mandolin. Americana UK described Charlotte's guitar playing as \"simply breathtaking.\"\n\nLaura Carrivick began playing violin at around 10 years old. She spends most of her time playing in her critically acclaimed duo, The Carrivick Sisters, with twin sister, Charlotte. Together, they've played all over the world, appeared on TV, recorded live sessions for national radio including BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, received several awards and released 5 albums. Maverick Magazine said of Laura; \"Laura's fiddle and dobro playing are astounding.\"\n\nJoe Tozer has one the EFDSS Young Musician Competition three times. The UK's leading bluegrass magazine, The British Bluegrass News, described Joe as an \"extraordinary talent on the mandolin and guitar.\"",
